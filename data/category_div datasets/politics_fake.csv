"Democrat Senator Warns Mueller Not To Release Findings On Russia Before 2018 Midterms","According to The Hill, Democrat Senator Bob Casey is warning special counsel Robert Mueller against issuing his Russia report near the 2018 electionSen. Bob Casey Jr. (D-Pa.) on Sunday warned special counsel Robert Mueller against issuing a report on his findings in the ongoing investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election near the upcoming 2018 midterm elections.Speaking to radio host John Catsimatidis on New York radio station AM 970, Casey said he couldn t make any assumptions about where the Mueller investigation is going in light of indictments issued on Friday. But he added that he would recommend Mueller not release a report on his findings near the midterms when it would distract from elections or cause people to question the election s integrity. I don t think we ll know anywhere near the full story until [Mueller] issues his report,  Casey said.  But once you get into the summer, and you get close to the election, I think it s a mistake for him to release it late. I think you should wait until after [the election]  Casey said.

In other words, what was NOT said in order to get the judge to approve the FISA warrant to spy:We can start with why law enforcement officials who submitted the application failed to note that the Clinton campaign and DNC funded the dossier. The application does note that the dossier was put together by a  U.S. person  with political motivations, but Republicans have argued that the application should have been more specific.Via Daily Caller: Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Sunday that the Department of Justice is investigating whether the FBI submitted accurate information about the infamous Steele dossier in order to obtain a surveillance warrant against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page. Are you, sir, investigating the fact that the FBI used the dossier to get a wiretap against Trump associates and they did not tell the FISA court that the Democrats and Hillary Clinton paid for the dossier?

"GOTCHA! A Stammering John Podesta Stunned by a REAL Question from CBS Reporter","John Podesta is Hillary Clinton s former campaign chairman so you know he s a dirty bird. That s why this is such a fun video to watch. Podesta had a brutal exchange on CBS s  Face the Nation  on Sunday when asked about the campaign s failure to focus on so-called  purple states  in 2016.Host Nancy Cordes noted that an indictment handed down by special counsel Robert Mueller on Friday showed that Russian operatives who meddled in the election appeared to realize the importance of focusing on those battleground contests. Then she goes in for the kill with this question: But it does beg the question, how is it that these Russian operatives knew to focus on purple states like Michigan and Wisconsin and your campaign didn t?  LOL! That s such a great snark-filled question!TRANSCRIPT OF FULL INTERVIEW:NANCY CORDES: Welcome back to  Face the Nation.  I m Nancy Cordes. Our next guest, John Podesta, was the chairman of Hillary Clinton s 2016 campaign. His private emails were hacked and released publicly by Russian-backed entities during the campaign. Mr. Podesta, thank you so much for being with us.JOHN PODESTA: Nice to be back, Nancy.NANCY CORDES: For anyone who voted for Hillary Clinton, these new indictments mean what?JOHN PODESTA: Well, look, it s a tragedy for the American people, really. As Mr. Mueller said in his indictment, this was an act of information warfare against the United States, against our democracy. So I think it s, obviously, disappointing to those of us who were on the receiving end of these Russian active measures, but I think the real victims here are the American people because there, there was direct interference with our democratic institutions.NANCY CORDES: The deputy attorney general was very careful on Friday to say that we don t know whether or not this operation swayed the election. You ve had a lot time think about this, where do you come down on that issue?JOHN PODESTA: Well, look, this was one part of a, of a complex, active interference in the measures. This didn t even deal with the hacking, this was only about what was going on in the social media and the, and the information campaign that was being done there, but there were 80 people, millions of dollars spent. And as one of your previous guests, Senator Coons noted, we won the popular vote by three million votes. They were pushing votes, just to give one example, to Jill Stein. Her vote in Michigan, in Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin was greater than the gap between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in those states. So you can t prove that it did affect the outcome, but it certainly seems likely that it had some impact.NANCY CORDES: But it does beg the question, how is it that these Russian operatives knew to focus on purple states like Michigan and Wisconsin, and your campaign didn t?JOHN PODESTA: Well, of course, we spent a lot of time, energy, and effort in all those states.NANCY CORDES: Hillary Clinton, herself, did not spend much time in those states.JOHN PODESTA: We, you know, we had   Tim Kaine was there, Barack Obama was in   and she spent enormous time in Pennsylvania and Michigan.NANCY CORDES: Sure.JOHN PODESTA: And we spent a lot of effort. We had more staff in Wisconsin than even President Obama had in 2012. But, but I think that begs the question, I think we, we focused on the places we thought were that were you know in contest, and at the end of the day, we fell short in those states. And I think that this active measures effort by the Russians could have tilted the election in, in Donald Trump s favor. But I think what the real issue is, is how he s reacted to that. And in that context, if we re   if this is information warfare, then I think he s the first draft-dodger in the war. I mean, he has done nothing but tried to undermine the Mueller investigation, he hasn t implemented the sanctions that he   was passed by the congress and that he signed in reaction to the, to the activities in the 2016 election. We learned this week, he s ordered no effort to try to get the intelligence community to get together to try to prevent further activities in the 2018 election.NANCY CORDES: Why do you think that is? Do you think it s because to do so would be to admit that somehow the Russians might have influenced this election?JOHN PODESTA: Well, you know, I think that Mr. Trump s psyche is complicated and people have said a lot, a lot about it, but he certainly can t accept that this activity may have helped him, and I think he just constantly tries to move the ball away, including what was, I think, really a despicable tweet about the fact that he s blaming the FBI for investigating the Russia investigation and somehow relating that to the tragic killings in Florida. But you know who knows with Mr. Trump? But he clearly, I think, has failed in carrying out his duty as president of the United States, which is to protect our democracy.NANCY CORDES: Midterm elections are coming up, and it s been reported that Democrats are telling your former boss, Bill Clinton, that in light of the Me Too movement, they, they think he should sit it out, he should be benched, and they re not looking for him to actively campaign for them. Is that true? And do you think that that s the right call?JOHN PODESTA: Look, I think he remains, I think, a figure who is popular with a lot of Democrats across the country. And I think that people are calling him, candidates are calling him and asking for advice. But whether he s going to be an active participant, I think that s not you know really on the top of his mind right now. I think he s doing other things, and, and people make their own judgments about whether he can be helpful in the campaign.NANCY CORDES: Do you think it s a good idea, very quickly, for him to sit it out?JOHN PODESTA: Well, you know, look, I think that, that if I was advising a campaign and a candidate about what to do, I would, I would sort of judge whether he can be helpful. And I think some places he can be, and probably some places he s more of a lightning rod.NANCY CORDES: All right, John Podesta, thank you so much. Campaign chairman for Hillary Clinton. And we ll be right back with our panel of Republicans who are leaving the House and Senate.",politics,18-Feb-18
"HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER Makes Shooting At Trump Option For Answer On Multiple Choice Test","EAG News  A Wyoming high school is under fire after parents exposed an online student quiz that offered  shooting at Trump  as one of the multiple choice answers.An unidentified English teacher at Jackson Hole High School gave students a multiple choice quiz on Thursday about George Orwell s novel  Animal Farm  that included a question that many are pointing to as an example of the district s  liberal bias,  the Jackson Hole News and Guide reports. Napoleon has a gun fired for a new occasion. What is the new occasion?  the quiz read.Possible answers included  He was shooting at Trump,   His birthday,   For completion of the windmill,  or  To scare off the attackers of Animal Farm. Jim McCollum told the news site he did a double-take when his son showed him a screenshot he took of the test. I had to read it two times,  McCollum said.  I was like,  Are you kidding me? McCollum, a Jackson Hole High School graduate and Trump supporter, shared the quiz on Facebook, where it was shared widely and generated a lot of angry comments. It was so inappropriate to show a name of a sitting president in that question,  he said.  To me, that is so wrong in light of the situation in our country and the divisiveness and all. He told the news site the incident is one of other examples of  liberal bias  in other classes at the school that make conservative students like son out to be  the outcast. He told me,  Dad, they crapped on everything I believe in,  McCollum said of his son.  Rylee is very patriotic, very supportive of our military and of our country  and is considering enlisting in the U.S. Marines.School officials eventually issued a statement about the quiz on Monday. (District) administration learned late yesterday that a quiz was administered to a class of high school students that contained an inappropriate answer to a multiple choice question. Administration is investigating this incident and verifying the information we have received,  the statement read. (The District) takes seriously threats of any kind, regardless of the intent. We apologize to the students, families, and community for this incident and will be addressing the issue with personnel. It s unclear what, if any, discipline the teacher may face.The incident occurred in the Teton County School District #1.According to The Washington Post:Last year, deeply conservative Wyoming voted for Trump by the widest majority of any state, 70 percent. In Teton County, Hillary Clinton got 60 percent, the only Wyoming county the Democrat won.Teton County is a wealthy ski and summer recreation destination. Residents include former Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter, Republican U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney.In 2015, school administrators canceled an  America Day  tradition for homecoming in which students donned red, white and blue and rode around on a diesel truck to show their patriotism and love of country. Activities director Mike Hansen put the kibosh on the event because he alleged some students might get offended.The school s juniors and seniors didn t buy it, however, and many showed up to school decked out in stars and stripes, then paraded the diesel truck around the school parking lot at the end of the day, waving American flags. It s homecoming week and our school administration thought it was too  offensive  to have an America Pride Day! So this is my kids answer to that!  local parent Ted Dawson posted to Facebook with pictures of his kids in patriotic get-ups.  Where have we gone wrong! I don t care what race or religion you are, you live here, benefit from the schools, enjoy tax benefits or whatever   you re an American or at least you better be! ",politics,18-Feb-18

The mainstream media and the Anti Defamation League (who ironically, claims to defend people who are victims of discrimination, yet works overtime to demonize anyone whose views are to the right of theirs), had to settle for fake ties to the massacre suspect and  white supremacist  group in Tallahassee, Florida.Unfortunately, both the media and the Anti Defamation League s stories quickly fell apart when they were outed for not having done their homework to properly vet the comments made on an open chat, social media platform called 4Chan.On Thursday afternoon, the Anti-Defamation League reported that a white supremacist group claimed ties with Nikolas Cruz, who confessed to the shooting spree that killed at least 17 people, including many high-school students, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.From the Anti Defamation League s website:A spokesperson for the white supremacist group Republic of Florida (ROF) claimed to the Anti-Defamation League on Thursday, February 15, that Nikolas Cruz, the man charged with the previous day s deadly shooting spree at a Parkland, Florida, high school, was associated with his group.UPDATE: On Thursday afternoon, following news reports of the alleged association between Cruz and the Republic of Florida, a member of an alt right discussion forum wrote that all of the claims were false and were part of an elaborate attempt to troll a network news reporter and other media outlets. At a press conference Thursday afternoon, the Broward County sheriff said a connection was  not confirmed at this time,  but that law enforcement was still investigating.Cruz, 19, a former student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, allegedly entered the school Wednesday, February 14 with an AR-15 and opened fire, killing at least 17 people and injuring 14 more. Cruz left the scene but was later captured by police and has been charged with premeditated murder.After self-described ROF members claimed on the discussion forum 4chan that Cruz had also been a member, the Anti-Defamation League spoke with an ROF member who identified himself as Jordan Jereb.Jereb, based in Tallahassee, is believed to be the leader of ROF.  In 2016, he was arrested on charges of threatening a staffer in the office of Florida Governor Rick Scott because he was allegedly angry at the staffer s son.Jereb said that Cruz was associated with ROF, having been  brought up  by another member.  Jereb also claimed that Cruz had participated in one or more ROF training exercises in the Tallahassee area, carpooling with other ROF members from south Florida.ROF has members in north and south Florida. The alt right white supremacist group borrows paramilitary concepts from the anti-government extremist militia movement (not itself a white supremacist movement).  ROF describes itself as a  white civil rights organization fighting for white identitarian politics  and seeks to create a  white ethnostate  in Florida.  Most ROF members are young and the group itself is only a few years old.Jereb added that ROF had not ordered or wanted Cruz to do anything like the school shooting.If Cruz s role is confirmed, the Parkland school shooting would be the second school shooting by a white supremacist in the past two months. In December 2017, another young white supremacist, William Atchison, engaged in a shooting spree at a high school in northwest New Mexico, killing two students before shooting himself.What we know about ROF (the Republic of Florida): A spokesperson for the white supremacist group Republic of Florida (ROF) told the Anti-Defamation League on Thursday, February 15, that Nikolas Cruz [ .] was associated with his group,  the ADL reported. The ADL quoted a man named Jordan Jereb, who runs the small group, which is based in Tallahassee. Jereb added that ROF had not ordered or wanted Cruz to do anything like the school shooting,  the ADL wrote in a blog post that was quickly picked up by ABC News and The Associated Press, and later percolated through dozens of other media outlets. Even The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website, picked up the claim.Some outlets reported they had their own conversations with Jereb or classmates of Cruz who allegedly corroborated the association of Cruz with ROF.But a few hours later, after law enforcement agencies said they had no evidence linking Cruz to ROF, Jereb said his identification of Cruz was a  misunderstanding  and that he, too, had been the subject of a  prank.  On online forums and Twitter, trolls and white nationalists gloated at the disinformation they had sowed. Politico reports-  All of our evidence seems to point to the ADL getting this wrong,  said Joan Donovan, a researcher who tracks online misinformation campaigns for Data & Society, a think tank in New York City.The ADL subsequently revised its report, as did many news outlets. ADL shared information from our experts on extremism and claims from white supremacist that we believed could be helpful to both law enforcement and the public due to the fluid and evolving nature of the events,  an ADL spokesperson said in a statement on Friday.  Confirmation of whether Cruz was part of ROF is now in the hands of law enforcement, and that s what the Broward sheriff s team is looking into. The ADL traced its original tip to posts on 4chan, where researchers found  self-described ROF members  claiming that Cruz was a brother-in-arms. But many of those posts seem to have been written specifically to deceive reporters and researchers.On Wednesday, an anonymous 4chan user posted about receiving a message on Instagram from an ABC News reporter after making a joke suggesting he knew Cruz. Prime trolling opportunity,  another user replied. You have to take advantage of this,  a third chimed in.He asked for proof of the reporter s identity, according to posted screenshots from their correspondence. The reporter provided an official email address and sent a photo of an ABC identification badge.Some on the 4chan thread joked about sending back obscene photos, but others gave concrete tips for tricking the reporter:  Keep talking to her so she gains your trust ;  Keep this going be realistic   say you have known him for years you met him on a Liberal Facebook page years ago and you have kept in touch ;  Say you are scared to tell her in case you get blamed, it will get her excited you know something big. This particular 4chan user seems to have sent the reporter a racist cartoon and was quickly blocked. Many on the forum ripped into him for missing a  a golden opportunity. ",politics,17-Feb-18
"LOOK WHO Approved Visas For Russian Operatives To Enter US And Interfere In Election","According to Fox News  A federal grand jury on Friday indicted 13 Russians and three Russian companies for allegedly interfering in the 2016 presidential election, in a case brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller that detailed a sophisticated plot to wage  information warfare  against the U.S.The Russian nationals are accused of setting a  strategic goal to sow discord in the U.S. political system, including the 2016 presidential election. The indictment   the first filed against Russian nationals as part of Mueller s probe   effectively returns focus to the meddling activities out of Russia in the run-up to the 2016 election, following a string of charges relating to the actions of Trump associates.Further, the DOJ made clear that the indictment does not allege that any of the interference changed the outcome of the presidential race. There is no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election,  Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel probe, said at a Friday press conference.President Trump reacted to the indictments by seizing on Rosenstein s comment that the election results were not impacted by the Russians  activity. Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President,  Trump tweeted.  The results of the election were not impacted.

"HEY, BERNIE SANDERS: 18 SCHOOL SHOOTINGS Have NOT Happened This Year!","The left has locked onto a stat that 18 school shootings have happened this year. This is FAKE NEWS that needs to be shut down. Bernie Sanders and others referred to this statistic right after the Parkland mass shooting.Anti-gun groups included in the statistics a suicide at a school in Michigan that had been closed. This fake statistic trivializes the horrific crime that happened at Parkland or any other TRUE school shooting. EVERYTOWN FOR GUN SAFETY  TRIES TO HIJACK THE NARRATIVE:Everytown for Gun Safety, the Michael Bloomberg backed anti-gun group founded after the 2012 school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, was the original source for that particular statistic. The group s initial tweet claiming that the attack at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School was the 18th school shooting in 2018 has now been retweeted more than 1,200 times:Our hearts are with all those impacted by the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida today.This is the 18th school shooting in the U.S. in 2018. https://t.co/YdPLz4zuOS  Everytown (@Everytown) February 14, 2018The group defines a school shooting is  any time a firearm discharges a live round inside a school building or on a school campus or grounds. ACCIDENTAL GUN DISCHARGES AND SUICIDES AREN T  SCHOOL SHOOTINGS It turns out that  Everytown s database turns up ridiculous examples that ARE NOT school shootings:On January 10,  gunshots, which most likely originated off-campus, hit a window of the visual arts building at California State University, San Bernardino. Classes were immediately canceled as the university went into lockdown, though a police search failed to turn up any shooter on campus.  On February 5, in a suburb of Minneapolis,  a school liaison officer was sitting on a bench talking with some students when a third-grader pressed the trigger on the officer s holstered weapon, causing it to fire and strike the floor.  Those were no doubt terrifying incidents for the people involved, and they may even have policy implications, but they are not what anyone thinks of when they hear the phrase  school shootings. But the media and several prominent politicians, such as Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), eagerly regurgitated the context-free statistic in the aftermath of the shooting in Florida, apparently without stopping to wonder why they hadn t heard about the other 17 school shootings that supposedly had happened since January 1.This isn t just an embarrassing case of confirmation bias. Spreading such misleading statistics affects how Americans from ordinary working people to elected officials understand and cope with these terrible incidents.",politics,16-Feb-18

However, this is the first gift either of his parents have made to Baldwin s campaign since Nicholson announced his own bid. My parents have a different worldview than I do, and it is not surprising that they would support a candidate like Tammy Baldwin who shares their perspective,  Nicholson said in a statement to CNN.

Around 2:30 I hear the bell ring for the fire alarm and we start heading out,  Walls said.  I m leading the line and we re heading out and it just so happens our fire zone was exactly where the shooter was,  but, Walls added, he did not see the shooter.

Forty five senators voted against it.The administration objected to the bill s failure to address so-called  chain migration    by which immigrants can sponsor a broad number of relatives to come join them in the U.S. Trump has said that he wants to limit sponsorship to children and spouses.The bill also would not end the visa lottery system, which allows 55,000 immigrants into the country each year and has been dogged by accusations of fraud and abuse.The Schumer-Rounds-Collins immigration bill would be a total catastrophe. @DHSgov says it would be  the end of immigration enforcement in America.

"The DIRTY TRUTH About DACA Recipients&Where Theyre REALLY Coming From&Their CRIMINAL Records&And How They REALLY Got Here","Yesterday, a second U.S. judge on Tuesday blocked President Donald Trump s decision to end a program that protects immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children from deportation.U.S. District Judge Nicholas Garaufis in Brooklyn ruled that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, cannot end in March as the Republican administration had planned, a victory for Democratic state attorneys general and immigrants who sued the federal government.The decision is similar to a Jan. 9 ruling by U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco that DACA must remain in place while litigation challenging Trump s decision continues.The legal battle over DACA complicates a debate currently underway in Congress on whether to change the nation s immigration laws.The Supreme Court on Friday is due to consider whether to take up the administration s appeal of the San Francisco ruling. The court could announce as soon as Friday afternoon whether it will hearing the case.  ReutersSince when does a judge unilaterally decide that a program based on an executive order by a radical and lawless president, with an expiration date, can be extended?Peel back the layers of lies that are being told to the American public by Democrats like Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, and their allies in the media, and discover the shocking truth about the  Dreamers (or voters) they re fighting so hard to keep in America.  According to The Hill, the narrative surrounding the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program holds that it was put in place to protect  kids  who were brought here through no fault of their own. DACA supporters implied that applicants were mostly Hispanic and that as citizens of distressed republics a short distance away from the wealthy United States, their violation of our immigration laws was somehow understandable. Program applicants were also portrayed as brilliant valedictorians and proud members of the military.From the outset, that narrative rang hollow. In a column for the Washington Post, Mickey Kaus described it as public-relations-style  hooey.  Here s why.New data released by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) definitively establishes that most of the DACA narrative is false. Particularly overblown are claims that deported DACA recipients would inevitably be strangers in a strange land.USCIS lists 149 countries of origin for DACA applicants. English is the national language in at least 26 of those countries. Those include the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Ireland. A large number of applicants are from India, Hong Kong and the Philippines, where there are enormous English-speaking communities.Other statistics also undermine claims that the United States must  take care of the DACAs  or condemn them to a life of isolation and poverty.In fact, many DACA applicant s birth countries are listed on the higher end of the common standard of living indexes. Which means that DACA advocates are arguing that the United States has a moral obligation to undermine its own laws in order to avoid returning illegal aliens to countries whose citizens are considered to have a higher standard of living than many Americans.One wonders why it has never occurred to Congress that its primary obligation should be protecting native-born American kids from illegal aliens who compete with them for entry-level jobs and seats at colleges and universities. Curiously, our elected representatives seem remarkably unconcerned about protecting America s standard of living.What is most disturbing about the data released by USCIS, however, is the number of DACA applicants who come from countries associated with terrorism or overt anti-Americanism.

"PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETS The Perfect New Years Message&Its Who He Included In His Tweet That Has Everyone LAUGHING!","As 2017 comes to a close, we d like to acknowledge our gratitude to President Trump, who is truly a gift to America. He came at a time when we needed him most. He came at a time when We The People were watching our freedoms and rights being stripped away by an out-of-control government. He came at a time when educators were teaching our youth that America was the enemy. He came at a time when American citizens were being forced to cede our country to unvetted foreign invaders and illegal aliens in exchange for Democrat Party votes. He came at a time when Democrats, celebrities, and the media were shaming gun owners and Christians for their conservative beliefs, and where daring to say  Merry Christmas  was a borderline punishable offense. He gave up a successful business and time spent with his close-knit family to step into a hornet s nest like no one could ever have imagined, but he did it because he believed in the greatness of America, and in defending that greatness, no matter the personal cost. That s what makes his New Years tweet so perfect!President Trump took time tonight, to wish his supporters,  enemies   the very dishonest Fake News Media  and even his  haters  a  Happy and Healthy  2018. As we say goodbye to an incredibly successful 2017, led by an incredibly successful President, we d like to thank President Trump for the incredible sacrifices he s made on behalf of every American (even those who don t yet understand) to Make America Great Again!President Trump tweeted:  As our Country rapidly grows stronger and smarter, I want to wish all of my friends, supporters, enemies, haters, and even the very dishonest Fake News Media, a Happy and Healthy New Year. 2018 will be a great year for America! As our Country rapidly grows stronger and smarter, I want to wish all of my friends, supporters, enemies, haters, and even the very dishonest Fake News Media, a Happy and Healthy New Year. 2018 will be a great year for America!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2017As a special tribute to President Trump, as he wraps up his unbelievably successful first year, we d like to share this powerful article, written by Evan Sayet. The article brilliantly explains why America loves the  fighter  Donald J. Trump. HE FIGHTSMy Leftist friends (as well as many ardent #NeverTrumpers) constantly ask me if I m not bothered by Donald Trump s lack of decorum. They ask if I don t think his tweets are  beneath the dignity of the office.  Here s my answer:We Right-thinking people have tried dignity. There could not have been a man of more quiet dignity than George W. Bush as he suffered the outrageous lies and politically motivated hatreds that undermined his presidency. We tried statesmanship. Could there be another human being on this earth who so desperately prized  collegiality  as John McCain? We tried propriety   has there been a nicer human being ever than Mitt Romney? And the results were always the same.This is because, while we were playing by the rules of dignity, collegiality and propriety, the Left has been, for the past 60 years, engaged in a knife fight where the only rules are those of Saul Alinsky and the Chicago mob.I don t find anything  dignified,   collegial  or  proper  about Barack Obama s lying about what went down on the streets of Ferguson in order to ramp up racial hatreds because racial hatreds serve the Democratic Party. I don t see anything  dignified  in lying about the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi and imprisoning an innocent filmmaker to cover your tracks. I don t see anything  statesman-like  in weaponizing the IRS to be used to destroy your political opponents and any dissent. Yes, Obama was  articulate  and  polished  but in no way was he in the least bit  dignified,   collegial  or  proper. The Left has been engaged in a war against America since the rise of the Children of the  60s. To them, it has been an all-out war where nothing is held sacred and nothing is seen as beyond the pale. It has been a war they ve fought with violence, the threat of violence, demagoguery and lies from day one   the violent take-over of the universities   till today.The problem is, through these years, the Left has been the only side fighting this war. While the Left has been taking a knife to anyone who stands in their way, the Right has continued to act with dignity, collegiality, and propriety.With Donald Trump, this all has come to an end. Donald Trump is America s first wartime president in the Culture War.During wartime, things like  dignity  and  collegiality  simply aren t the most essential qualities one looks for in their warriors. Ulysses Grant was a drunk whose behavior in peacetime might well have seen him drummed out of the Army for conduct unbecoming. Had Abraham Lincoln applied the peacetime rules of propriety and booted Grant, the Democrats might well still be holding their slaves today. Lincoln rightly recognized that  I cannot spare this man. He fights. General George Patton was a vulgar-talking, son-of-a-bitch. In peacetime, this might have seen him stripped of rank. But, had Franklin Roosevelt applied the normal rules of decorum, then Hitler and the Socialists would barely be five decades into their thousand-year Reich.Trump is fighting. And what s particularly delicious is that, like Patton standing over the battlefield as his tanks obliterated Rommel s, he s shouting,  You magnificent bastards, I read your book!  That is just the icing on the cake, but it s wonderful to see that not only is Trump fighting, he s defeating the Left using their own tactics.That book is Saul Alinsky s Rules for Radicals   a book so essential to the Liberals  war against America that it is and was the playbook for the entire Obama administration and the subject of Hillary Clinton s senior thesis. It is a book of such pure evil, that, just as the rest of us would dedicate our book to those we most love or those to whom we are most indebted, Alinsky dedicated his book to Lucifer.Trump s tweets may seem rash and unconsidered but, in reality, he is doing exactly what Alinsky suggested his followers do. First, instead of going after  the fake media    and they are so fake that they have literally gotten every single significant story of the past 60 years not just wrong, but diametrically opposed to the truth, from the Tet Offensive to Benghazi, to what really happened on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri   Trump has isolated CNN. He made it personal. Then, just as Alinsky suggests, he employs ridicule which Alinsky described as  the most powerful weapon of all. Everyone gets that it s not just CNN   in fact, in a world where Al Sharpton and Rachel Maddow, Paul Krugman and Nicholas Kristof are people of influence and whose  reporting  is in no way significantly different than CNN s   CNN is just a piker.Most importantly, Trump s tweets have put CNN in an untenable and unwinnable position. With Trump s ability to go around them, they cannot simply stand pat. They need to respond. This leaves them with only two choices.They can either  go high  (as Hillary would disingenuously declare of herself and the fake news would disingenuously report as the truth) and begin to honestly and accurately report the news or they can double-down on their usual tactics and hope to defeat Trump with twice their usual hysteria and demagoguery.The problem for CNN (et al.) with the former is, if they were to start honestly reporting the news, that would be the end of the Democratic Party they serve. It is nothing but the incessant use of fake news (read: propaganda) that keeps the Left alive. Imagine, for example, if CNN had honestly and accurately reported then-candidate Barack Obama s close ties to foreign terrorists (Rashid Khalidi), domestic terrorists (William Ayers), the mafia (Tony Rezko) or the true evils of his spiritual mentor, Jeremiah Wright s, church.Imagine if they had honestly and accurately conveyed the evils of the Obama administration s weaponizing of the IRS to be used against their political opponents or his running of guns to the Mexican cartels or the truth about the murder of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and the Obama administration s cover-up. This makes  going high  a non-starter for CNN. This leaves them no other option but to ratchet up the fake news, conjuring up the next  nothing burger  and devoting 24 hours a day to hysterical rants about how it s  worse than Nixon. This, obviously, is what CNN has chosen to do. The problem is, as they become more and more hysterical, they become more and more obvious. Each new effort at even faker news than before, and faker  outrage  only makes that much more clear to any objective observer that Trump is and always has been right about the fake news media.And, by causing their hysteria, Trump has forced them into numerous, highly embarrassing and discrediting mistakes. Thus, in their desperation, they have lowered their standards even further and run with articles so clearly fake that, even with the liberal (lower case  l ) libel laws protecting the media, they ve had to wholly retract and erase their stories repeatedly.Their flailing at Trump has even seen them cross the line into criminality, with CNN using their vast corporate fortune to hunt down a private citizen for having made fun of them in an Internet meme. This threat to  dox    release of personal information to encourage co-ideologists to visit violence upon him and his family   a political satirist was chilling in that it clearly wasn t meant just for him. If it were, there would have been no reason for CNN to have made their  deal  with him public.Instead, CNN   playing by  Chicago Rules    was sending a message to any and all: dissent will not be tolerated. This heavy-handed and hysterical response to a joke on the Internet has backfired on CNN, giving rise to only more righteous ridicule.So, to my friends on the Left   and the #NeverTrumpers as well   do I wish we lived in a time when our president could be  collegial  and  dignified  and  proper ? Of course, I do. These aren t those times. This is war. And it s a war that the Left has been fighting without opposition for the past 50 years.So, say anything you want about this president   I get it, he can be vulgar, he can be crude, he can be undignified at times. I don t care. I can t spare this man. He fights.Townhall published this brilliant article on July 13, 2017.

"WATCH: SENATOR LINDSEY GRAHAM DROPS BOMBSHELL& FINALLY Confirms The Fake Russian Dossier Was Used To Obtain FISA Warrant To Spy On Trump","Everyone suspected the sketchy Steele Dossier was what corrupt FBI and DOJ officials used to get the October 2016 FISA warrant against Trump. FBI and DOJ officials refuse to answer that question publicly.Rep Ron DeSantis (R-FL) said in a statement: We now know that the so-called Steele dossier was paid for by the Democratic Party in an effort to gin up negative information regarding then-candidate Trump. What the American people deserve to know is whether the information compiled by Steele on the Democrats  dime was used by the Obama administration to obtain approval to conduct surveillance against Trump associates. The FBI has stonewalled producing these documents for months and their production shouldn t be limited to closed door viewing by a small number of members of Congress. The Trump administration should immediately declassify all the documents used to obtain surveillance warrants against Trump or his associates. Immediately after his inauguration, President Trump came out swinging over the  fake  Russian dossier. He even went as far as to blame the intelligence community.  President Trump was immediately criticized for his comments, and the media behaved as though he was insane to even insinuate such a wild theory. As it turns out, he wasn t too far off the mark.CT   Despite a hundred different ways congressional investigators have asked the question, and despite numerous on-camera questions to FBI and DOJ officials about the 2016 FISA process, no-one had definitively confirmed the Christopher Steele  Russian Dossier  was the underlying evidence for the 2016 FISA application to gain wiretaps and electronic surveillance upon presidential candidate Donald Trump. UNTIL NOW.Senator Lindsey Graham just confirmed the sketchy Steele Dossier was used to get the wiretap and surveillance warrant from the FISA court. Brian Kilmeade understood what he was hearing was serious, but didn t quite catch the specific gravity of it. Watch at starting at the 04:10 mark: The back-story to the FISA warrant is the cornerstone. The back-story contains both the FBI and the DOJ scheme. Expose it, remove it, and the entire  muh Russia conspiracy  collapses under the weight of sunlight This is critical and important because the specific use of the Steele Dossier underpins the BIG UGLY and exposes the entire top-tier apparatus of the FBI Counterintelligence Division (Peter Strzok, Bill Priestap, James Baker, Andrew McCabe) and the DOJ National Security Division (John Carlin, Stuart Evans, Mary McCord and Sally Yates), as well as DOJ Bruce Ohr and FBI lawyer Lisa Page directly to  conspiracy  charges.The 2016 FBI counterintelligence operation was surveillance on the Trump Campaign and was thinly disguised under the fraudulent auspices of a FISA warrant, sold as a defense of U.S. democracy from Russia, which permitted the wiretaps and surveillance etc.The DOJ involvement surrounds legal arguments, processing of FISA applications, and use of the legal system to support the FBI operation with actionable legal framing (against Trump). The DOJ National Security Division carried out that collaboration with the FBI.Tablet Mag did a deep dive into the Fusion-GPS connection to the creation of the Steele Dossier; and more specifically how Fusion-GPS head Glenn Simpson and his wife Mary Jacoby were instrumental in getting the dossier assembled and into the hands of the White House prior to the DOJ and FBI applying for the FISA warrant   SEE HERE.Tablet Mag outlines how Mary Jacoby even bragged about getting the  Russiagate  narrative started:A Tablet investigation using public sources to trace the evolution of the now-famous dossier suggests that central elements of the Russiagate scandal emerged not from the British ex-spy Christopher Steele s top-secret  sources  in the Russian government which are unlikely to exist separate from Russian government control but from a series of stories that Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson and his wife Mary Jacoby co-wrote for TheWall Street Journal well before Fusion GPS existed, and Donald Trump was simply another loud-mouthed Manhattan real estate millionaire.Understanding the origins of the  Steele dossier  is especially important because of what it tells us about the nature and the workings of what its supporters would hopefully describe as an ongoing campaign to remove the elected president of the United States.[ ] In a Facebook post from June 24, 2017, that Tablet has seen in screenshots, Jacoby claimed that her husband deserves the lion s share of credit for Russiagate. (She has not replied to repeated requests for comment.)  It s come to my attention that some people still don t realize what Glenn s role was in exposing Putin s control of Donald Trump,  Jacoby wrote.  Let s be clear. Glenn conducted the investigation. Glenn hired Chris Steele. Chris Steele worked for Glenn. This assertion is hardly a simple assertion of family pride; it goes directly to the nature of what became known as the  Steele dossier,  on which the Russiagate narrative is founded. (read more)The Tablet-Mag outline shows the distinct trail of the finished Steele Dossier entering into the White House and how President Obama likely saw and reviewed the content.However, missing from this report is an origination angle even more nefarious.Remember, previous media reporting -in conjunction with Clinton campaign admissions- have confirmed the DNC and Clinton Campaign financed Fusion-GPS through their lawyers within Perkins Coie. Fusion then hired Nellie Ohr the wife of DOJ Deputy Bruce Ohr who thereafter sub-contracted with retired British MI6 agent Christopher Steele to write/research/provide credibility for  the dossier. The dates here are important because they tell a story.The origin of the Clinton effort with Fusion-GPS was April 2016. That s the same month Fusion hired Nellie Ohr, wife of DOJ Deputy Bruce Ohr, to gather opposition research on candidate Trump. It would be most likely that Nellie Ohr was in contact with Christopher Steele. DOJ Deputy Attorney Bruce Ohr was later demoted for his unreported contacts with Christopher Steele and Fusion-GPS founder Glenn Simpson in October 2016; the same month the FISA warrant was granted.However, there was another event in this April 2016 timeline which enhances the trail of the Dossier origination. [Hat Tip Katica] Check this out:In April 2016 Mary Jacoby shows up on White House visitor logs meeting with President Obama officials. In April 2016 the Clinton Campaign and DNC hired Fusion-GPS to organize the Russia research, that later became known as the  Steele Dossier .(link to White House Logs)The wife of Glenn Simpson (Fusion GPS), Mary B. Jacoby, with years of Russia-angled reporting  including Donald Trump  visits the White House in April 2016, at the same time as the DNC and Clinton hire Fusion GPS to conduct the opposition research on Donald Trump, surrounding Russia?This timeline is entirely too obvious to be coincidental.Expand slightly and consider:April: Mary Jacoby, wife of Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson, visits the White House. The Clinton Campaign and DNC then hire Fusion GPS to conduct  Opposition Research , with a Russian emphasis. Fusion GPS then hires Nellie Ohr who specializes in Russian-centric counterintelligence. Nellie Ohr then contacts MI6 agent Christopher Steele to write a Russian Dossier. A month later, May 2016: Nellie Ohr s husband inside the DOJ, Bruce Ohr, is then working with FBI counterintelligence head Peter Strzok. By June 2016: Peter Strzok, Bruce Ohr, and DOJ Attorney Lisa Page then apply for the first FISA warrant.[June 24th, 2017, Mary Jacoby appears on Facebook taking credit for the origination of the Russiagate narrative.]This timeline is so transparent it s deafening.[More from the Tablet] Simpson and Jacoby had ID d Manafort as a world-class sleazeball and they were right. A slick Georgetown Law grad running in GOP circles since the Reagan campaign, Manafort used his talents and connections to get paid by some very bad people. I would only add here that, in my personal experience, journalists are not in the habit of forgetting major stories they ve written, especially stories with a character like Manafort at the center.So when the Trump campaign named Paul Manafort as its campaign convention manager on March 28, 2016, you can bet that Simpson and Jacoby s eyes lit up. And as it happened, at the exact same time that Trump hired Manafort, Fusion GPS was in negotiations with Perkins Coie, the law firm representing the Clinton campaign and the DNC, to see if there was interest in the firm continuing the opposition research on the Trump campaign they had started for the Washington Free Beacon. (more)Mary Jacoby and Glenn Simpson   Fusion GPSIf the counterintelligence FISA warrant was obtained through deception, misleading/manipulated information, or fraud; and that warrant is what led to the wiretapping and surveillance of candidate Donald Trump and General Flynn; and that warrant was authorized by FISA Court Judge Contreras  who was the judge in Flynn s case, and is now recused  the entire tenuous FBI and DOJ operation begins to collapse and the outline of a  conspiracy  becomes clearly evident.The back-story to the FISA warrant is the cornerstone.

Bono is so sucked in by the Clintons and other limousine liberals that he s living in La La Land BLEAKEST ERA U2 frontman Bono bashed President Donald Trump in a lengthy Rolling Stone cover story this week, lamenting Trump s criticism of the press and said the election of the real estate mogul and the current political climate  is surely the bleakest era since Nixon.

"BILL NYE The FAKE Science Guy THREATENS Conservatives&Blue States Will Impose Economic Sanctions Against Climate Change Denying States","Friday on MSNBC, climate activist Bill Nye warned conservatives to  watch out,  saying progressive blue states will  address climate change  on their own.Nye said,  Only 40 percent of people in the U.S. think that Congress should be addressing this and that s because certain conservative groups, especially from the fossil fuel industry, have been very successful in introducing the idea that scientific uncertainty, plus or minus two percent, is the same as plus or minus 100 percent. He continued,  There s a lot of emphasis from conservatives on what are writ-large states rights. Just watch out, conservatives, if states rights include California, Illinois, New York   these places that, where people voted in a progressive fashion   watch out if all those places start to address climate change and then impose economic sanctions, either overtly or by default, on places that have not embraced the work that needs to be done. Then you ll end up with this states rights working the other way. He added,  We ve got to remind people that we re all in this together. The people I think about all the time are what are eloquently stated as the hillbillies. We want to engage everybody. Not working to address climate change is in no one s best interest. It is not in the best interest, especially of your children and grandchildren. A couple of times you mentioned that I am against the president and so on. I m not especially against the president. I just think he s gotten himself surrounded by people who are willing to mortgage the future, to let the people who are coming into the workforce now pay for the future. This is true, not just with regard to the national debt, which will almost certainly increase the same way it tripled under the beloved Ronald Reagan, not only will that national debt increase, but the climate debt, in a sense, what we have to do to address climate change, will be more and more difficult to pay back or pay down.    Breitbart NewsThe climate change debate went nuclear last year, over a whistleblower s explosive allegation that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association manipulated data to advance a political agenda by hiding the global warming  pause. In an article on the Climate Etc. blog, John Bates, who retired last year as principal scientist of the National Climatic Data Center, accused the lead author of the 2015 NOAA  pausebuster  report of trying to  discredit  the hiatus through  flagrant manipulation of scientific integrity guidelines and scientific publication standards. In addition, Mr. Bates told the Daily [U.K.] Mail that the report s author, former NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information director Thomas Karl, did so by  insisting on decisions and scientific choices that maximized warming and minimized documentation. Gradually, in the months after [the report] came out, the evidence kept mounting that Tom Karl constantly had his  thumb on the scale    in the documentation, scientific choices, and release of datasets   in an effort to discredit the notion of a global warming hiatus and rush to time the publication of the paper to influence national and international deliberations on climate policy,  Mr. Bates said Saturday on Climate Etc.The June 2015 report,  Possible artifacts of data biases in the recent global surface warming hiatus,  which updated the ocean temperature record, was published six months before the U.N. s Paris summit.The accusations sparked a fierce back-and-forth Sunday between so-called climate warmists and skeptics over the validity and implications of Mr. Bates  claim, which he defended on the Climate Etc. blog run by former Georgia Tech climatologist Judith Curry.Zeke Hausfather, Berkeley Earth climate scientist, said in a Sunday  fact-check  on the CarbonBrief blog that the Karl paper s conclusions  have been validated by independent data from satellites, buoys, and Argo floats and many other independent groups. While NOAA s data management procedures may well need improvement, their results have been independently validated and agree with separate global temperature records created by other groups,  Mr. Hausfather said, citing Berkeley Earth and the U.K. s Met Office Hadley Centre.He said the record  strongly suggests that NOAA got it right and that we have been underestimating ocean warming in recent years. Meanwhile, the whistleblowing prompted a  we-told-you-so  moment from Republicans on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee who have long suspected the Obama administration of retroactively fiddling with climate data in order to erase the 1998-2013 pause in global temperature increases. Now that Dr. Bates has confirmed that there were heated disagreements within NOAA about the quality and transparency of the data before publication, we know why NOAA fought transparency and oversight at every turn,  said Chairman Lamar Smith in a Sunday statement.The panel launched an investigation into the NOAA pausebuster report after whistleblowers said the study was  rushed to publication before underlying data issues were resolved to help influence public debate about the so-called Clean Power Plan and upcoming Paris climate conference. Dr. Bates  revelations and NOAA s obstruction certainly lend credence to what I ve expected all along   that the Karl study used flawed data, was rushed to publication in an effort to support the president s climate change agenda and ignored NOAA s own standards for scientific study,  Mr. Smith said.Mr. Bates said he decided to come forward after reading a Washington Post article Dec. 13 that said federal scientists are  frantically copying U.S. climate data, fearing it might vanish under Trump. As a climate scientist formerly responsible for NOAA s climate archive, the most critical issue in archival of climate data is actually scientists who are unwilling to formally archive and document their data,  he said on Climate Etc.In his experience, the  most serious example of a climate scientist not archiving or documenting a critical climate dataset was the study of Tom Karl et al. 2015 (hereafter referred to as the Karl study or K15), purporting to show no  hiatus  in global warming in the 2000s. NOAA did not return immediately Sunday a request for comment. The Daily Mail said that Mr. Karl  admitted the data had not been archived when the paper was published  but denied trying to influence the climate summit. Asked why he had not waited, he said:  John Bates is talking about a formal process that takes a long time. He denied he was rushing to get the paper out in time for Paris, saying:  There was no discussion about Paris,  said the Daily Mail article.The American Geophysical Union issued a statement saying it was  very closely monitoring the situation, have considered the possible implications, and will be sharing any new information or response by AGU with you here.

"JUST IN: TRUMP ENDS FREE MONEY TRAIN After Pakistan Refuses To Stop Housing Terrorists&Cuts STUNNING About Of Military Aid ","The Trump administration on Friday announced the United States will deny Pakistan military aid amounting to $255 million as it expects Islamabad to take decisive action  against terrorists and militants on its soil . The United States does not plan to spend the $255 million in FY 2016 in Foreign Military Financing for Pakistan at this time,  said a spokesperson of the President s National Security Council in a statement to Hindustan Times. The President has made clear that the United States expects Pakistan to take decisive action against terrorists and militants on its soil, and that Pakistan s actions in support of the South Asia Strategy will ultimately determine the trajectory of our relationship, including future security assistance. The Administration continues to review Pakistan s level of cooperation. The statement reflected and sealed the administration s complete disillusionment with Pakistan, which had sought to brazenly disregard the explicit warnings issued by President Donald Trump personally and leading members of his cabinet, such as secretaries James Mattis and Rex Tillerson.Financial Times reported last week that  the Trump administration is considering dropping Pakistan as an ally as it examines tough measures to quell more than 20 terrorist groups it says are based in the country.  Here again, the President who is daily derided and ridiculed by foreign policy  experts  is right, and they are wrong: Pakistan is no ally, and has not been for years. This is a rupture that is much needed and long overdue.President Trump has accused the Pakistani government of  housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. And it s true, with the most notorious of these being Osama bin Laden himself. Journalist Carlotta Gall, who reported from Afghanistan for the New York Times for twelve years, reported in March 2014 that:Soon after the Navy SEAL raid on Bin Laden s house, a Pakistani official told me that the United States had direct evidence that the ISI chief, Lt. Gen. Ahmed Shuja Pasha, knew of Bin Laden s presence in Abbottabad. The information came from a senior United States official, and I guessed that the Americans had intercepted a phone call of Pasha s or one about him in the days after the raid.  He knew of Osama s whereabouts, yes,  the Pakistani official told me. The official was surprised to learn this and said the Americans were even more so.He shouldn t have been. It had been obvious for years at that point, and remains obvious, that the Pakistanis had been aiding the same jihadists that the U.S. government has been giving them billions of dollars to fight. This could be the severest blow dealt to Islamabad by this administration if it indeed decided to withhold it,  said a leading US expert on Pakistan, who did not want to be identified.  There is more coming,  the expert added.  IOTWReportThe amount, $255 million, is left over from $1.1 billion aid earmarked for Pakistan in 2016, and which included non-military aid as well. It was cleared for handing over in August, just days before it would lapse as unspent money.First reported by The New York Times, the move to withhold the money, which may not be large but would have signaled US backing, is reported to have come shortly after Pakistan refused to hand over to the Americans an operative of the Haqqani Network apprehended during the rescue of an American-Canadian family in October.The Haqqani Network is an affiliate of Afghan Taliban and works out of Pakistan, inflicting massive casualties on the US-led international coalition in Afghanistan. Frustrated by Islamabad s reluctance to give them, the United States has tied large portions of military aid payments to Pakistan for its actions aimed at debilitating the network.Pakistan, however, has chosen to lose hundreds of millions of dollars in such payments over 2015 and 2016, instead of kicking out the terrorists. And it has lost equity.The Trump administration was clear from the start it wouldn t countenance continuity in ties and aid without real changes.  We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting,  President Donald Trump had said unveiling his new South Asia strategy in August.  But that will have to change, and that will change immediately.   Hindustan Times",politics,"Dec 30, 2017"

"IT ONLY TOOK ONE TWEET FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP For Billionaires To Open Up Their Wallets For This FIGHTER!","A week after President Trump endorsed Ron DeSantis for Florida governor via Twitter, a handful of billionaires have thrown their support behind the three-term Republican congressman, per Politico.Here s President Trump s tweet endorsing Rep. Ron DeSantis for governor of Florida.  Trump tweeted:  Congressman Ron DeSantis is a brilliant young leader, Yale and then Harvard Law, who would make a GREAT Governor of Florida. He loves our Country and is a true FIGHTER! Congressman Ron DeSantis is a brilliant young leader, Yale and then Harvard Law, who would make a GREAT Governor of Florida. He loves our Country and is a true FIGHTER!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2017Why it matters: The monetary support DeSantis has received could prove instrumental in his race, because, in a  state as big as Florida, where a week s worth of saturation TV during next year s general election could cost as much as $3 million, cash is king,  per Politico.Supporters include casino magnate Sheldon Adelson, hedge fund heiress Rebekah Mercer, investment tycoon Foster Friess, as well as other donors who have funded Trump s 2016 campaign and the conservative Koch brothers  network, per Politico.  AxiosRepresentative Ron DeSantis (R-FL) is a fighter. Here s an example of how DeSantis took on the fake Trump-Russian collusion story:Sun Sentinel   DeSantis, who hasn t officially announced his candidacy, thanked Trump in a press release with the headline,  President Trump Backs Ron DeSantis for Governor of Florida. I m grateful to have the president s support and appreciate what he has done,  DeSantis said, adding praise for Trump achievements that have pleased conservatives: recognizing Jerusalem as Israel s capital, signing the tax reform legislation, and appointing conservative judges.DeSantis, a Republican from Ponte Vedra Beach, has been a strong supporter of Trump.In August, he proposed cutting off funding for special counsel Robert Mueller s investigation into possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russian efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election.DeSantis  proposal, which went nowhere, would have stopped money for the investigation 180 days after it becomes law. And it would have prevented Mueller from investigating  matters  that occurred before Trump announced his presidential campaign.Also in August, DeSantis used an appearance at the Palm Beach County Republican Party s annual lobsterfest to advertise his pro-Trump credentials.As he delivered a combination political speech and invocation, the big screens at the front of the room flashed a picture of DeSantis, his wife, their infant daughter, the president and First Lady Melania Trump outside the White House.DeSantis said the president complimented his wife on her appearance.At that Palm Beach County appearance, and at events throughout the state, DeSantis has been laying the groundwork for a 2018 candidacy for the Republican nomination to run for governor.Here s Ron DeSantis blasting the press and our government agencies for giving Barack Obama a free pass over his support for Hezbollah:The Trump effect: DeSantis reflects the shifting type of Republican candidate under Trump: he s a Fox News contributor, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, a supporter of Trump s recent decision to make Jerusalem the home of the U.S. embassy in Israel, and he opposes Special Counsel Bob Mueller s Russia probe (even calling for it to end after just six months).",politics,"Dec 29, 2017"

"AMERICAN WORKERS Scr@wed Over By Outsourcing Jobs Get Their Day In Court","American workers have suffered tremendously with the outsourcing of jobs to foreign workers. The H-1B Visa program has scr@wed over Americans with decades of experience in jobs. American workers are forced to train their foreign replacements adding insult to injury for the American workers being laid off.Many of the workers are threatened that they will lose their payout if they break a gag order. One of the most famous cases of an employee who didn t take a payout so he could speak up is from a Disney worker. The emotional testimony below is Exhibit One of why this Visa program is so horrible:AMERICAN WORKERS SUE FOREIGN COMPANY: American workers suing an India-based outsourcing firm accused of discriminating against its U.S.-born employees, while favoring Indian nationals, will get their day in court thanks to an Oakland, California federal judge. This week, a California federal judge not only refused to throw out a case against Tata Consulting Services (TCS), one of the largest outsourcers in the U.S. of American jobs, but he also turned the case into a class-action lawsuit, according to Bloomberg.ANTI-AMERICAN BIAS:The case was brought against TCS in 2015 by American workers who said they experienced an anti-American bias at the company, which they say overwhelmingly favors imported workers of Indian descent.Brian Buchanan, one of the American workers suing TCS in the class-action suit, said he had nearly 30 years of experience in the Information Technology (IT) industry when he and roughly 400 American workers were laid off by Southern California Edison after TCS was contracted to outsource the Americans  jobs to cheaper foreign workers.Read more: Breitbart",politics,"Dec 29, 2017"

In fact, we re sure it will leave you puzzled.As you probably know, it was reported on Thursday that Trump s approval at the end of his first year in office is on par with Obama s approval rating at the same time during his presidency.Daily Caller reports: Fox & Friends  shared this fact on air Friday morning, leading the president to tweet this out:While the Fake News loves to talk about my so-called low approval rating, @foxandfriends just showed that my rating on Dec. 28, 2017, was approximately the same as President Obama on Dec. 28, 2009, which was 47% and this despite massive negative Trump coverage & Russia hoax!

On Dec. 28, 2017, Trump had a 46 percent approval rating. Obama s approval rating on December 29, 2009   just one day later   was 46 percent, the exact same as Trump s.So Brian Stelter is apparently angry that Fox News reported poll numbers that are factually accurate because they happen to be favorable to the president.

This is a great takedown:Coleman told Stelter that  CNN has taken a very strong position on global warming that it is a consensus. Well there is no consensus in science. Science isn t a vote. Science is about facts,  and that he was  terribly disappointed  by his former network, The Weather Channel, because it  has bought into [climate change]. But so has all the media. That s no big surprise.

Coleman s open letter to UCLA was sent to numerous local television stations in the Los Angeles area, as well as the Los Angeles Times.Coleman produced a special report for KUSI-TV, entitled Global Warming: The Other Side.

"WHY THIS Democrat Stronghold County Voted For Trump&And Why Theyll Vote For Him Again: Hes a fighter&nobodys gonna push him into a corner [VIDEO]","AP News  The regulars amble in before dawn and claim their usual table, the one next to an old box television playing the news on mute.Steven Whitt fires up the coffee pot and flips on the fluorescent sign in the window of the Frosty Freeze, his diner that looks and sounds and smells about the same as it did when it opened a half-century ago. Coffee is 50 cents a cup, refills 25 cents. The pot sits on the counter, and payment is based on the honor system.People like it that way, he thinks. It reminds them of a time before the world seemed to stray away from them, when coal was king and the values of the nation seemed the same as the values here, in God s Country, in this small county isolated in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.Everyone in town comes to his diner for nostalgia and homestyle cooking. And, recently, news reporters come from all over the world to puzzle over politics   because Elliott County, a blue-collar union stronghold, voted for the Democrat in each and every presidential election for its 147-year existence.Until Donald Trump came along and promised to wind back the clock. He was the hope we were all waiting on, the guy riding up on the white horse. There was a new energy about everybody here,  says Whitt. I still see it. Despite the president s dismal approval ratings and lethargic legislative achievements, he remains profoundly popular here in these mountains, a region so badly battered by the collapse of the coal industry it became the symbolic heart of Trump s white working-class base.The frenetic churn of the national news, the ceaseless Twitter taunts, the daily declarations of outrage scroll soundlessly across the bottom of the diner s television screen, rarely registering. When they do, Trump doesn t shoulder the blame   because the allegiance of those here is as emotional as it is economic.It means God, guns, patriotism, saying  Merry Christmas  and not Happy Holidays. It means validation of their indignation about a changing nation: gay marriage and immigration and factories moving overseas. It means tearing down the political system that neglected them again and again in favor of the big cities that feel a world away.On those counts, they believe Trump has delivered, even if his promised blue-collar renaissance has not yet materialized. He s punching at all the people who let them down for so long   the presidential embodiment of their own discontent. He s already done enough to get my vote again, without a doubt, no question,  Wes Lewis, a retired pipefitter and one of Whitt s regulars, declares as he deals the day s first hand of cards.He thinks the mines and the factories will soon roar back to life, and if they don t, he believes they would have if Democrats and Republicans and the media   all  crooked as a barrel of fishhooks    had gotten out of the way. What Lewis has now that he didn t have before Trump is a belief that his president is pulling for people like him. One thing I hear in here a lot is that nobody s gonna push him into a corner,  says Whitt, 35.  He s a fighter. I think they like the bluntness of it. He plops down at an empty table next to the card game, drops a stack of mail onto his lap and begins flipping through the envelopes. Bill, bill, bill,  he reports to his wife, Chesla, who has arrived to relieve him at the restaurant they run together. He needs to run home and change of out his Frosty Freeze uniform, the first of several work ensembles he wears each day, and put on his second, a suit and tie.

"CHAIRMAN OF DEMS FOR TRUMP: My Party is Suffering from Trump Derangement [Video]","We have to agree that the left is suffering from Trump derangement because just about anything the POTUS does is met with derision from the Democrats. There is no middle ground but only division that continues with the leaders of the left stirring the pot. Think about it. Without the division, the left has nothing Well, the The chairman of Democrats for Trump reacted to repeated calls for the president s impeachment and obstructionist behavior by members of his party. I think it s Trump derangement,  former New York City Council President Andrew Stein said on  Fox & Friends. Ed Henry played video of Rep. Al Green (D-Texas) introducing articles of impeachment and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.) telling a crowd that President Trump s motives and actions  are contemptible. Impeach 45 every day,  she later said.Stein said he doesn t know why his fellow Democrats think Trump is a  bad guy. Stein thinks President Trump should just continue to take his message to the people. We have to agree that the president needs to go around the lying media to deliver his message.The latest example of lying from the media is the poor treatment of First Lady Melania Trump. The media bombarded Melania with fake news about a tree that needed to be cut down. The press made it seem like  evil  Melania demanded that the tree be removed.

"HOUSE INTEL Slaps Subpoenas on McCain Institute Associate Involved in Trump Dirty Dossier Sources","Please see our previous report below on the McCain Institute associate who has now been subpoenaed by the House Intel Committee. David J. Kramer was in hot water before for the same reason the Intel Committee is now issuing a subpoena:He was previously subpoenaed by the lawyers for a Russian tech executive suing BuzzFeed. The guy just refuses to give out any information on sources for the  dirty  dossier. This raises the question of if there were sources that were fictional and were used just to build a fake case against Trump. President Trump just tweeted out that the dossier is a  pile of garbage . Could it be that this  pile of garbage  was used to make the case for a FISA warrant to spy on POTUS  The plot thickens on this one The Daily Caller reports: The House Intelligence Committee has issued a subpoena for an associate of Arizona Sen. John McCain s who revealed last week that he knows the names of the Russian sources used in former British spy Christopher Steele s infamous dossier.A congressional source tells The Daily Caller that California Rep. Devin Nunes issued the subpoena on Wednesday for David J. Kramer, a former State Department official.Kramer refused to divulge the names of Steele s sources during a Dec. 19 interview with the panel, the source says.Steele used Russian sources to gather information on the Trump campaign and Donald Trump s activities in Russia. The ex-spy was working for Fusion GPS, an opposition research firm that was on the payroll of the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE MCCAIN ASSOCIATE WHO REFUSED TO SPILL THE BEANS: Lawyers for a Russian tech executive suing BuzzFeed for publishing the Steele dossier say that a longtime associate of Arizona Sen. John McCain and two major news outlets are resisting subpoenas seeking their depositions for the case.In a brief filed in federal court late Wednesday, lawyers for the executive, Aleksej Gubarev, claim that David Kramer (pictured below), a former State Department official and McCain associate,  has been seemingly avoiding service  of a deposition subpoena for weeks.Please see the very curious input Reason.com put out just this July regarding Kramer s involvement in the Steele dossier getting into the hands of the press. And The New York Times and Wall Street Journal are challenging deposition subpoenas they have been served as part of the case.Gubarev s lawyers are attempting to find out who gave BuzzFeed the salacious dossier, which the website published to much controversy on Jan. 10.The dossier, written by former British spy Christopher Steele, alleges that Gubarev and his companies, XBT Holdings and Webzilla, used spam, viruses and porn bots to hack into DNC computer systems. Gubarev vehemently denies the allegations.Gubarev s attorneys say that identifying BuzzFeed s source could shed light on whether the news outlet was warned that information in the dossier could be false. They argue that publishing the dossier despite such warnings would show  reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the information published. BuzzFeed has defended its decision to publish the dossier, which was financed by the Clinton campaign and DNC and commissioned by opposition research firm Fusion GPS. It is also resisting demands from Gubarev s team to identify its dossier source on the grounds that it would violate its First Amendment protections as a news-gathering organization.Via: Daily CallerReason had this to say on July 16th on the mystery surrounding how the fake dossier got into the hands of Buzzfeed:Did John McCain and a controversial D.C. lobbying group conspire to get the infamous  pee dossier  into the hands of the press?A lawsuit making its way through court in the UK hopes to determine just what role the senator and his associates had in making the lurid dossier public.New filings in the lawsuit, obtained by McClatchy, detail how David Kramer employed by the nonprofit and purportedly non-political McCain Institute acted as a representative of McCain in the Arizona senator s dealings on sensitive intelligence measures:According to a new court document in the British lawsuit, counsel for defendants Steele and Orbis repeatedly point to McCain, R-Ariz., a vocal Trump critic, and a former State Department official as two in a handful of people known to have had copies of the full document before it circulated among journalists and was published by BuzzFeed.

Actress Jenna Fischer decided to use her huge fan base of over 750,000 followers on Twitter to point out how the GOP Tax bill that President Trump worked so hard to push through was punishing teachers. The only problem is, Fischer s tweet was incorrect.Maybe she should stick to comedy.Actress Jenna Fischer, best known for her role as Pam on NBC s  The Office,  found herself in hot water after she shared inaccurate information about the GOP tax bill on Twitter.

"SAY WHAT? PROSECUTORS Claim Convicted ISLAMIC TERRORIST Used His LAPTOP and Jihadi Materials To Radicalize Fellow Prisoners In NY Prison","According to The Sun, George W. Bush  successor, Barack Obama, promised to close the camp in 2009, calling it a  sad chapter in American history .But he faced strong opposition from Congress and succeeded only in reducing the number of inmates from 245 to around 40, as detainees were either freed or transferred to other countries.Since his election in 2016, Donald Trump has vowed to keep the prison open and use it to detain  bad dudes .He has also stated he would happily use torture against inmates.He said:  I would bring back waterboarding, and I d bring back a hell of a lot worse than waterboarding  Don t tell me it doesn t work torture works  if it doesn t work, they deserve it anyway, for what they re doing to us. We have to fight fire with fire. According to CNN, the man convicted in the 2016 bombing in New York s Chelsea neighborhood that injured 30 people has been trying to radicalize other inmates, federal prosecutors say.Ahmad Khan Rahimi also told a judge he is on a hunger strike.Rahimi provided inmates with copies of terrorist propaganda and jihadist materials, including speeches by Osama Bin Laden and the late militant cleric Anwar al-Awlaki, bomb-making instructions, books on jihad and issues of the al Qaeda-backed magazine Inspire, prosecutors said.Rahimi  has been attempting to radicalize fellow inmates in the Metropolitan Correction Center by, among other things, distributing propaganda and publications issued by terrorist organizations,  according to a letter from Acting U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim to US District Judge Richard Berman.Rahimi let other inmates view the items on his laptop and gave them electronic copies, Kim s letter said. Discs of the materials were found in two inmates  possession.Defense attorneys for Rahimi have yet to respond to the allegations.Prosecutors said Rahimi began distributing these materials in October if not earlier. Rahimi was convicted October 16 on eight federal charges in connection with the Chelsea bombing.Among the inmates Rahimi gave the materials to, prosecutors say, is Sajmir Alimehmeti, who is scheduled to go on trial next month on terrorism-related charges.Rahimi was arrested and charged after a pressure cooker bomb went off in New York s Chelsea neighborhood on September 17, 2016. A second pressure cooker bomb was found a few blocks away, on 27th Street, but didn t detonate.Earlier the same day, a bomb went off near the start of a Marine Corps charity run in Seaside Park, New Jersey.After a two-week trial and roughly four hours of jury deliberation, Rahimi was convicted of charges including the use and attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, bombing a public place, destroying property by means of fire or explosives, and using a destructive device in furtherance of a crime of violence.During the trial, the prosecution presented evidence   including DNA and fingerprints   linking Rahimi to the bombs that were placed in New Jersey and New York.Rahimi faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison, according to an earlier statement from Kim.Rahimi faces separate charges in other jurisdictions in connection with the bomb that went off in Seaside Park, a backpack containing improvised explosive devices found the following day at a transit station in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and a shootout he had with police before being taken into custody.",politics,"Dec 27, 2017"
"ISRAEL WILL NAME New Train Station Near Western Wall After President Donald Trump","Israel s transportation minister is pushing ahead with a plan to extend Jerusalem s soon-to-open high-speed rail line to the Western Wall, where he wants to name a future station after President Donald Trump. The Western Wall is the holiest place for the Jewish people, and I decided to name the train station that leads to it after president Trump   following his historic and brave decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel,  Transportation Minister Yisrael Katz told the Jerusalem Post.The national daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth was first to report Tuesday that Katz had approved final construction plans for the train, which will include excavating a 2-mile tunnel from the Umma (nation) station at the entrance to the city to the Cardo in the Jewish Quarter.The route will take travelers through downtown Jerusalem and under the politically and historically sensitive Old City. The Western Wall is the holiest site where Jews can pray.Transportation Ministry spokesman Avner Ovadia said Wednesday the project is estimated to cost more than $700 million and, if approved, would take four years to complete.Katz s office said in a statement that the minister advanced the plan in a recent meeting with Israel Railways executives, and has fast-tracked it in the planning committees.Katz said a high-speed rail station would allow visitors to reach  the beating heart of the Jewish people   the Western Wall and the Temple Mount. Donald Trump: It s time to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital.Trump s announcement acknowledging Jerusalem as Israel s capital   and his pledge to move America s embassy there   enraged Palestinians and much of the Muslim world.The United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution last week rejecting the U.S. s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital, with several traditional American allies voting in favor of the motion.The Western Wall train proposal will likely face opposition from the international community, which doesn t recognize Israeli sovereignty over east Jerusalem and the Old City, which Israel captured in the 1967 Mideast war and later annexed.

"WHY THIS BLUE-COLLAR DEMOCRAT STRONGHOLD County Is Still Fighting For Trump: He was the hope we were all waiting on, the guy riding up on the white horse [VIDEO]","AP News  The regulars amble in before dawn and claim their usual table, the one next to an old box television playing the news on mute.Steven Whitt fires up the coffee pot and flips on the fluorescent sign in the window of the Frosty Freeze, his diner that looks and sounds and smells about the same as it did when it opened a half-century ago. Coffee is 50 cents a cup, refills 25 cents. The pot sits on the counter, and payment is based on the honor system.People like it that way, he thinks. It reminds them of a time before the world seemed to stray away from them, when coal was king and the values of the nation seemed the same as the values here, in God s Country, in this small county isolated in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains.Everyone in town comes to his diner for nostalgia and homestyle cooking. And, recently, news reporters come from all over the world to puzzle over politics   because Elliott County, a blue-collar union stronghold, voted for the Democrat in each and every presidential election for its 147-year existence.Until Donald Trump came along and promised to wind back the clock. He was the hope we were all waiting on, the guy riding up on the white horse. There was a new energy about everybody here,  says Whitt. I still see it. Despite the president s dismal approval ratings and lethargic legislative achievements, he remains profoundly popular here in these mountains, a region so badly battered by the collapse of the coal industry it became the symbolic heart of Trump s white working-class base.The frenetic churn of the national news, the ceaseless Twitter taunts, the daily declarations of outrage scroll soundlessly across the bottom of the diner s television screen, rarely registering. When they do, Trump doesn t shoulder the blame   because the allegiance of those here is as emotional as it is economic.It means God, guns, patriotism, saying  Merry Christmas  and not Happy Holidays. It means validation of their indignation about a changing nation: gay marriage and immigration and factories moving overseas. It means tearing down the political system that neglected them again and again in favor of the big cities that feel a world away.On those counts, they believe Trump has delivered, even if his promised blue-collar renaissance has not yet materialized. He s punching at all the people who let them down for so long   the presidential embodiment of their own discontent. He s already done enough to get my vote again, without a doubt, no question,  Wes Lewis, a retired pipefitter and one of Whitt s regulars, declares as he deals the day s first hand of cards.He thinks the mines and the factories will soon roar back to life, and if they don t, he believes they would have if Democrats and Republicans and the media   all  crooked as a barrel of fishhooks    had gotten out of the way. What Lewis has now that he didn t have before Trump is a belief that his president is pulling for people like him. One thing I hear in here a lot is that nobody s gonna push him into a corner,  says Whitt, 35.  He s a fighter. I think they like the bluntness of it. He plops down at an empty table next to the card game, drops a stack of mail onto his lap and begins flipping through the envelopes. Bill, bill, bill,  he reports to his wife, Chesla, who has arrived to relieve him at the restaurant they run together. He needs to run home and change of out his Frosty Freeze uniform, the first of several work ensembles he wears each day, and put on his second, a suit and tie. He also owns a local funeral home and he s the county coroner, elected as a Democrat.The Whitts, like many people here, cobble together a living with a couple jobs each   sometimes working 12 or 15 hours a day   because there aren t many options better than minimum wage.

When the flight attendant saw her taking a picture of the congresswoman who was seated in her front row, first-class seat, she threatened to remove her from the plane.Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) in seat 1A the one I paid for dearly, and the one United gave to her without my consent or knowledge! Fellow congressman on same flight said she does it repeatedly. @united pic.twitter.com/Q2c6u6B0Yp  Jean-Marie Simon (@JeanMarieSimon1) December 23, 2017A mechanical problem with the plane delayed take-off and after about 50 minutes, she said, passengers were invited to consult with a gate agent about alternative flights.Simon said she went to the front and snapped a photo of Jackson Lee and told a flight attendant that she knew why she d been bumped.In her statement, Jackson Lee said she overheard Simon speaking with an African-American flight attendant and saw her snap the photo.JACKSON LEE PULLS THE RACE CARD: Since this was not any fault of mine, the way the individual continued to act appeared to be, upon reflection, because I was an African American woman, seemingly an easy target along with the African American flight attendant who was very, very nice,  Jackson Lee said in the statement.  This saddens me, especially at this time of year given all of the things we have to work on to help people. But in the spirit of this season and out of the sincerity of my heart, if it is perceived that I had anything to do with this, I am kind enough to simply say sorry. Simon said Jackson Lee s statement accused her of racism, adding:  I had no idea who was in my seat when I complained at the gate that my seat had been given to someone else,  she said.  There is no way you can see who is in a seat from inside the terminal. It was just so completely humiliating,  said Jean-Marie Simon, a 63-year-old attorney and private school teacher who used 140,000 miles on Dec. 3 to purchase the first-class tickets to take her from Washington D.C. to Guatemala and back home.According to True Pundit   The Democrat has developed a reputation for making life hell for any clerk, stewardess, or pilot unwilling or unable to make her three-and-a-half-hour flight anything less than glamorous. She takes advantage of federal travel perks to book multiple flights (only to cancel at the last minute and at no charge). She demands an upgrade to premier seats. She expects, in her words,  to be treated like a queen. Sometimes it gets ugly. For instance, when one peasant of a flight attendant failed to serve the food Jackson Lee requested, the congresswoman went wild.  Don t you know who I am?  she reportedly shrieked.  I m Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee. Where is my seafood meal? I know it was ordered! That inflight incident was in 1998, and Jackson Lee has only increased in seniority since. She sits on the Committee on Homeland Security and she serves as the ranking member of the subcommittee on transportation security, no doubt, giving her, even more, sway over the airlines and even more of a reason to feel entitled.When accused of taking an ill-gotten first-class seat, Jackson Lee was adamant she didn t do anything wrong. It s just the way she expects to be treated.  I asked for nothing exceptional or out of the ordinary and received nothing exceptional or out of the ordinary,  the congresswoman said in a statement.

"WHY FINAL Sunday Night Football Game Was Canceled& Is Low Attendance The Reason?","The NFL announced Tuesday that the final  Sunday Night Football  game of the season has been canceled Was it due to low attendance in previous weeks? Well, it s part of the reason. Low attendance has been plaguing the league since the kneeling controversy took hold.Recently, a liberal news source tried to downplay the boycott from NFL fans by citing injuries from key star athletes in the NFL as the reason for low interest in games.  We think the kneeling controversy has more to do with the lack of interest in games. It s being reported that the attendance is down 9% from last year:We ve seen stadiums with hundreds of empty seats along with low viewership.There are a few other reasons why the game was canceled but low attendance was certainly part of it:Daily Caller reports:The league had yet to announce who would play during the primetime game next Sunday, but with the chance that none of the matchups would have playoff implications for one or both of the teams, they opted not to schedule the game.NEW YEAR S EVE:The other problem the league faced was broadcasting a game on New Year s Eve, which would invite lower number of viewers traditionally on that night. We felt that both from a competitive standpoint and from a fan perspective, the most fair thing to do is to schedule all Week 17 games in either the 1 p.m. or 4:25 p.m. windows,  NFL broadcast chief Howard Katz said in a statement.The last time a  Sunday Night Football  game took place on the final night of the year was in 2006 when the Chicago Bears hosted the Green Bay Packers. That game was Hall of Fame member Brett Favre s final game with the Packers. Despite that fact, the game only drew 13.4 million viewers, which for that season was a quarter of the typical audience for  SNF. In a season plagued with lower ratings due to the national anthem protests, the league s decision was not surprising.",politics,"Dec 26, 2017"
"SHAME! SENATE QUIETLY RELEASES New Report Revealing Tax Dollars Spent Settling Harassment Claims","The Senate waited until Christmas to quietly release a report on how much was dolled out to settle workplace harassment claims. Remember that you never approved this and they used YOUR money to make the payments to accusers. The amount is $1.5 million. This needs to end. The Senators  should pay for this on their own. It s just too easy to settle using someone else s money YOUR money!Via Daily Caller: As the Christmas holiday weekend set in, the Senate Rules and Administration Committee released a report revealing the Senate has spent $1.5 million on workplace harassment settlements since 1998.The data, provided by the Office of Compliance, a little known administrative body that has quietly settled dozens of complaints against congressional offices, provides little by way of details, beyond an itemized list of violations and the corresponding settlement.GOP Sen.

The video below shows just how out of control the left is when it comes to the corruption within the FBI and DOJ.When a Republican lawmaker called for a  purge  of what he said are  deep state  elements within the FBI and Justice Department, the MSNBC host Hallie Jackson was clearly agitated and shocked: I m very concerned that the DOJ and the FBI, whether you call it deep state or what, are off the rails,  Florida Rep. Francis Rooney stated then cited reasons behind his concern. The anti-Trump bias and the demotion of Bruce Ohr were just two of the examples Rooney gave.Jackson shot back,  Congressman, you just called the FBI and the DOJ off the rails. Something that you re okay with talking about here? How does that not sort of undermine the work that the agencies are doing? I don t want to discredit them. I would like to see the directors of those agencies purge it,  said Rooney.

"MEDIA IGNORES TRUMPS FIRST Record-Breaking Christmas Season&Retail Sales Of $600 BILLION: This is literally the best season since before the recession","The Stock Market is setting record after record and unemployment is at a 17 year low. So many things accomplished by the Trump Administration, perhaps more than any other President in first year. Sadly, will never be reported correctly by the Fake News Media!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2017CBS News reported on the retailer s record-breaking holiday season without ever mentioning President Trump:Total retail sales this holiday season added up to a record $598 billion dollars   up $33 billion from last year.Not surprisingly, the AP also failed to mention President Trump: Experts have issued rosy forecasts for the season. Shoppers seemed to be in the mood with unemployment at a 17-year low and consumer sentiment at its highest level since 2000. Shoppers have been spending at a pace not seen since the Great Recession, says Craig Johnson, president of retail consulting group Customer Growth Partners. The Wall Street Journal reported sales were up for retailers like Macy s and Wal-Mart. The Wall Street Journal even mentioned that spending was up in all income categories, as shoppers were encouraged by rising wages and low unemployment, but failed to attribute any of the retailer s success to President mention Trump:Retailers are enjoying some extra Christmas cheer.Fueled by high consumer confidence and a robust job market, U.S. retail sales in the holiday period rose at their best pace since 2011, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks both online and in-store spending.Sales, excluding automobiles, rose 4.9% from Nov. 1 through Christmas, compared with a 3.7% gain in the same period last year, according to the Mastercard Inc. unit, which tracks all forms of payment. E-commerce continued to drive the gains, rising 18.1%. Overall, this year was a big win for retail,  Ms. Quinlan said.That newfound buoyancy is a relief to retailers from department-store giants like Macy s Inc. to mall favorites like Gap Inc. that struggled through a difficult year of store closures, declining foot traffic and bankruptcies by chains including the Sports Authority, Toys  R  Us and Payless Shoes.Investors, who have abandoned many retail stocks even as the broader stock market surged, have started to return. Shares of Macy s and Gap, for example, have jumped 24% and 18%, respectively, in the past month, compared with a 3% gain in the S&P 500. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. has rallied 40% on the year and, like online nemesis Amazon.com Inc., is trading near all-time highs. Unlike in past years, when spending was driven by high-income shoppers, this holiday season a broader swath of the population opened their wallets, encouraged by rising wages and low unemployment, analysts and economists said. Fewer people are living paycheck to paycheck,  said Chris Christopher, executive director of economic-research firm IHS Markit.  There is a lot more spending from the lower- and middle-income groups, while the upper-income groups are splurging. Fox Business News reported the amazing Christmas season sales, but neglected to mention President Trump s positive effect on the economy:Retailers are finally enjoying some Christmas cheer.Fueled by high consumer confidence and a robust job market, U.S. retail sales in the holiday period rose at their best pace since 2011, according to Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks both online and in-store spending.Sales, excluding automobiles, rose 4.9% from Nov. 1 through Christmas Eve, compared with a 3.7% gain in the same period last year, according to the Mastercard Inc. unit, which tracks all forms of payment.

She might think twice before doing it again after the angry woman she bumped took photos of Lee enjoying the seat the passenger paid for. Ouch!Sheila Jackson Lee (D-Texas) in seat 1A the one I paid for dearly, and the one United gave to her without my consent or knowledge! Fellow congressman on same flight said she does it repeatedly. @united pic.twitter.com/Q2c6u6B0Yp  Jean-Marie Simon (@JeanMarieSimon1) December 23, 2017Chron reports:Jean-Marie Simon was a passenger on a flight from Houston to Washington D.C. and has accused United Airlines of giving her first-class seat to U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee. D-Houston. The flight attendant threatened to remove her from the plane for complaining and snapping a photo of the Houston congresswoman:A mechanical problem with the plane delayed take-off and after about 50 minutes, she said, passengers were invited to consult with a gate agent about alternative flights.Simon said she went to the front and snapped a photo of Jackson Lee and told a flight attendant that she knew why she d been bumped.In her statement, Jackson Lee said she overheard Simon speaking with an African-American flight attendant and saw her snap the photo.JACKSON LEE PULLS THE RACE CARD: Since this was not any fault of mine, the way the individual continued to act appeared to be, upon reflection, because I was an African American woman, seemingly an easy target along with the African American flight attendant who was very, very nice,  Jackson Lee said in the statement.  This saddens me, especially at this time of year given all of the things we have to work on to help people. But in the spirit of this season and out of the sincerity of my heart, if it is perceived that I had anything to do with this, I am kind enough to simply say sorry. Simon said Jackson Lee s statement accused her of racism, adding:  I had no idea who was in my seat when I complained at the gate that my seat had been given to someone else,  she said.  There is no way you can see who is in a seat from inside the terminal. PASSENGER THREATENED?About five minutes after Simon took the photo on the plane, Simon said, another flight attendant sat next her and asked if she  was going to be a problem. Simon said she replied that she just wanted to go home.IS THE $500 VOUCHER EVIDENCE OF WRONGDOING BY THE AIRLINE? WHAT HAPPENED WHEN SIMON ARRIVED AT THE GATE: It was just so completely humiliating,  said Jean-Marie Simon, a 63-year-old attorney and private school teacher who used 140,000 miles on Dec. 3 to purchase the first-class tickets to take her from Washington D.C. to Guatemala and back home.When it came time to board the last leg of her flight home from George Bush Intercontinental Airport on Dec. 18, after a roughly hour-long weather delay, Simon said the gate attendant scanned her paper ticket and told her it was not in the system.Did you cancel your flight?, the attendant asked. No,  she said she replied.  I just want to go home. Her seat, 1A, was taken, she was told. Simon was given a $500 voucher and reseated in row 11, Economy Plus.Simon later learned that Jackson Lee was in her pre-purchased seat and has alleged that the congresswoman received preferential treatment, which United denies.THIS ENTITLED MENTALITY WILL HOPEFULLY GET JACKSON LEE KICKED OUT OF CONGRESS!",politics,"Dec 25, 2017"

The First Lady was the only member of the presidents family to attend mass with him.Reverend James Harlan, the churchs rector, gave the homily. It centered around the themes of the power of words and Gods light. He began by quoting Nelson Mandela, whom he noted rebelled against his government for its systemic oppression.The Mandela quote: It is never my custom to use words lightly. If 27 years in prison have done anything to us, it was to use the silence of solitude to make us understand how precious words are and how real speech is in its impact on the way people live and die. Harlan connected the power of words especially as it pertains to Gods word to their ability to educate, enlighten and draw out the best in people, while he also cautioned words can be used to cause harm.Your words can have as much destructive potential as they do healing, Harlan said. Gods word is pure light.A crowd of people encircled the president to shake his hand when it came time for the peace-be-with-yous.

"MOVIEGOING HITS 22-YR LOW&LA Times Blames Everyone But ANTI-TRUMP HOLLYWOOD","The LA Times is reporting that moviegoing is at the lowest level since 1995. The article blames Americans who are going to see fewer movies, on streaming services, which, to some extent, could be true, but from the majority of the comments we ve seen on our Facebook page, which reaches almost 1.7 million followers, Americans are no longer interested in paying their hard-earned money to support the anti-American and anti-Trump hate machine that is Hollywood. While there are a few openly conservative actors in Hollywood, the majority of them are swimming in a cesspool of liberalism and are consumed with hate for President Trump and his deplorable supporters.  From George Clooney trashing Trump over his stance on refugees coming to America from Muslim hotbed nations, to Meryl Streep using a televised award ceremony to trash our newly inaugurated President, to has-been pop stars like Madonna saying she d like to blow up the White House; America has had it up to their eyeballs with people who are some of America s top earners, thanks to the support of people they openly mock for supporting President Trump.  The LA Times reports, that Hollywood is celebrating the end of 2017 with astronomical sales from  Star Wars: The Last Jedi,  which is on track to soon exceed $1 billion in global ticket sales and eventually become the biggest movie of the year. But that won t be enough to write a happy storyline for the industry.Although movie ticket sales in the U.S. and Canada are expected to dip just below last year s record of $11.38 billion, the number of tickets sold is projected to drop 4% to 1.26 billion   the lowest level since 1995, according to preliminary estimates from studio executives.The falloff in ticket sales can mostly be explained by a handful of movies that flopped, especially during the dreary summer season that posted the worst results in more than two decades. Even such massive hits as  Wonder Woman,   Thor: Ragnarok  and  It  couldn t make up for a lackluster summer lineup populated by rickety franchises ( Alien: Covenant ) and poorly reviewed retreads ( The Mummy ).However, the long-term decline in attendance reflects systemic challenges facing the industry. Audiences are spending less time going to the movies and are consuming more entertainment on small screens and through streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon that are spending billions on original video content.Sorry to burst your liberal bubble, but now that the curtain has been pulled back, the deplorable crowd isn t interested in supporting hate-filled, liberal Hollywood.

"PRESIDENT TRUMP Calls Out Corrupt FBI Clinton Crony for Alleged Misuse of FBI Email","You just can t make this level of cronyism up. It s a blatant disregard for laws, rules and just about everything else unethical. But this is the Clintons so the rules don t apply to them. They are sickeningly corrupt grifters who have been able to get away with just about everything for decades. It s time to call them out and hold them accountable for their lawlessness. The American people need to be able to trust their government will follow the rule of law. The time is now President Trump tweeted out to call out the FBI s Andrew McCabe on his cronyism with the Clintons and misuse of FBI email:President Trump tweeted Sunday that FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe allegedly used his official agency email account to  promote  his wife s failed 2015 attempt to win, as a Democrat, a Virginia state Senate seat..@FoxNews-FBI s Andrew McCabe,  in addition to his wife getting all of this money from M (Clinton Puppet), he was using, allegedly, his FBI Official Email Account to promote her campaign. You obviously cannot do this. These were the people who were investigating Hillary Clinton.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 24, 2017 The president has long been a critic of the FBI s cronyism with the Clintons. Our previous report on what went on when Andrew McCabe s wife ran for Virginia state senate is unbelievably corrupt:OUR REPORT ON THE CLINTON CRONY BACK IN OCTOBER SPELLS OUT THE CORRUPTION:How much more criminal activity are American voters willing to overlook? Have we, as Americans gotten to the point that no crime committed by Hillary or anyone attached to Hillary will disqualify her from being elected to the highest office in our nation? Are we willing to accept that we can no longer trust anyone working for a government organization in America? The political organization of Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, an influential Democrat with longstanding ties to Bill and Hillary Clinton, gave nearly $500,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an official at the Federal Bureau of Investigation who later helped oversee the investigation into Mrs. Clinton s email use.Campaign finance records show Mr. McAuliffe s political-action committee donated $467,500 to the 2015 state Senate campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe, who is married to Andrew McCabe, now the deputy director of the FBI.The Virginia Democratic Party, over which Mr. McAuliffe exerts considerable control, donated an additional $207,788 worth of support to Dr. McCabe s campaign in the form of mailers, according to the records. That adds up to slightly more than $675,000 to her candidacy from entities either directly under Mr. McAuliffe s control or strongly influenced by him. The figure represents more than a third of all the campaign funds Dr. McCabe raised in the effort.Mr. McAuliffe and other state party leaders recruited Dr. McCabe to run, according to party officials. She lost the election to incumbent Republican Dick Black.A spokesman for the governor said he  supported Jill McCabe because he believed she would be a good state senator. This is a customary practice for Virginia governors  Any insinuation that his support was tied to anything other than his desire to elect candidates who would help pass his agenda is ridiculous. Among political candidates that year, Dr. McCabe was the third-largest recipient of funds from Common Good VA, the governor s PAC, according to campaign finance records. Dan Gecker received $781,500 from the PAC and $214,456 from the state party for a campaign that raised $2.9 million, according to records; and Jeremy McPike received $803,500 from the PAC and $535,162 from the state party, raising more $3.8 million that year for his candidacy.The governor could recall only one meeting with Mr. McCabe when he and other state Democrats met with the couple on March 7, 2015, to urge Dr. McCabe to run, according to the spokesman.The FBI said in a statement that during his wife s campaign Mr. McCabe  played no role, attended no events, and did not participate in fundraising or support of any kind. Months after the completion of her campaign, then-Associate Deputy Director McCabe was promoted to Deputy, where, in that position, he assumed for the first time, an oversight role in the investigation into Secretary Clinton s emails. FBI officials said that after that meeting with the governor in Richmond on March 7, Mr. McCabe sought ethics advice from the bureau and followed it, avoiding involvement with public corruption cases in Virginia, and avoiding any campaign activity or events.Mr. McCabe s supervision of the Clinton email case in 2016 wasn t seen as a conflict or an ethics issue because his wife s campaign was over by then and Mr. McAuliffe wasn t part of the email probe, officials said. Once I decided to run,  Dr. McCabe said,  my husband had no formal role in my campaign other than to be a supportive husband to me and our children. As a federal official everyone who participated in our campaign understood and respected that he could not participate. Mr. McCabe is a longtime FBI official who focused much of his career on terrorism. His wife is a hospital physician who campaigned in northern Virginia, where the couple live with their children.The 2015 Virginia State senate race was Dr. McCabe s first run for office and her campaign spent $1.8 million. The race was part of Mr. McAuliffe s failed effort to win a Democratic majority in the Virginia legislature, which would have given him significantly more sway in Richmond, the state capital.Mr. McAuliffe has been a central figure in the Clintons  political careers for decades. In the 1990s, he was Bill Clinton s chief fundraiser and he remains one of the couple s closest allies and public boosters. Mrs. Clinton appeared with him in northern Virginia in 2015 as he sought to increase the number of Democrats in the state legislature. For entire story: WSJ",politics,"Dec 24, 2017"
"WHY OBAMAS CORRUPT INNER CIRCLE Is Desperately Fighting To Protect His Failed Reputation"," History shows that we can, if we must, tolerate nuclear weapons in North Korea. Those words were written by former National Security Adviser Susan Rice on Thursday in the New York Times, in arguing for appeasement towards Kim Jong-un.It was also the perfect symbol of everything that was wrong with Barack Obama s feckless foreign policy   and it explains why the world that President Donald Trump inherited is so dangerous and unstable.The Obama administration believed it was worth living in the shadow of terror and nuclear aggression as long as the U.S. could maintain a dignified posture that could not provoke anyone.  BreitbartNoah Rothman of Commentary Magazine wrote a brilliant article about the  death rattle of Obama s reputation . In his article, Rothman reminds us of the ineffective and dangerous path former President Barack Obama took our nation down, and why the successes of President Trump are forcing his corrupt inner circle to speak out against Trump in defense of Obama s failed legacy.The members of Barack Obama s administration in exile have become conspicuously noisy of late even more so than usual. Former CIA Director John Brennan accused Donald Trump and his administration of engaging in  outrageous,   narcissistic  behavior typical of  vengeful autocrats  by threatening proportionate retaliation against countries that voted to condemn the United States in the United Nations, as though that were unprecedented. It is not. James Clapper, Obama s director of national intelligence, all but alleged that the president is a Russian  asset.  Perhaps the most acerbic and incendiary series of accusations from the former Democratic president s foreign-policy professionals were placed in the New York Times by Obama s national security advisor, Susan Rice. In her estimation, America has abdicated its role as a  force for good. Rice s attacks on the Republican administration deserve the most attention, if only because they are the most apoplectic. Donald Trump s recently released national-security review paints a  dark,   almost dystopian  vision of the world, Rice contended. His world is full of  hostile states and lurking threats.  Rice claimed that there is  no common good  in Trump s worldview. What s more, there is no  international community  and no  universal values.  There are just  American values. Rice acknowledges that Moscow is a threat to regional stability and peace,  Western values,  and U.S. sovereignty. She implies that Trump is a menace because he declines to recognize that. In fact, it was Obama much more so than Trump who has failed to see the obvious.Barack Obama was inarguably the least Atlanticist president since the end of World War II. Within a year of Russia s brazen invasion and dismemberment of the former Soviet Republic of Georgia, Obama scrapped George W. Bush-era agreements to move radar and missile interceptor installations to Central Europe. In 2013, the last of America s armored combat units left Europe, ending a 69-year footprint on the Continent. By 2014, there were just two U.S. Army brigades stationed in Europe. The folly of this demobilization became abundantly clear when Vladimir Putin became the first Russian leader since Stalin to invade and annex territory in neighboring Ukraine.A year later, Putin intervened militarily in Syria, where U.S. forces were already operating, resulting in the most dangerous escalation of tensions between the two nuclear powers since the end of the Cold War. Putin s move in Syria should not have come as a surprise; Barack Obama outsourced the resolution of the Syrian conflict to Moscow in 2013, if only to avoid making good on his self-set  red line  for intervention in that conflict despite the norm-shattering use of WMDs on civilians. Even Rice s chief complaint about Trump, his failure to condemn Putin s brazen intervention in the 2016 election, didn t elicit a reaction from Barack Obama until the final month of his presidency.By contrast, and to the surprise of just about everyone, the Trump administration has been tough on Russia. Trump has ordered harsh sanctions on Moscow s Iranian allies for violating United Nations resolutions a course the Obama administration declined to take even if it allowed Hezbollah terrorists with direct links to Putin to operate with impunity. He ordered long overdue airstrikes on Putin s vassal regime in Syria, halting any further use of chemical weapons in the process. Trump not only declined to lift Obama-era sanctions on Moscow, as many feared he would, but expanded them. This administration closed Russian consulates and annexes in the United States. It has targeted Putin allies like Chechen strongman Ramzan Kadyrov under the Magnitsky Act the same act that Kremlin cutout Natalia Veselnitskaya lobbied the Trump campaign to scuttle. Trump has even gone so far as to open U.S. arms sales to Ukraine, representing a significant blow to Putin s ambitions in Europe. It is without a doubt that Trump now has a stronger record on Russia than Barack Obama ever did. No wonder Susan Rice is so angry.Rice further alleged that Trump recklessly accused China of being an  avowed opponent  of the U.S. rather than just a competitor, and then insisted that China has not  illegally occupied its neighbors.  Tell that to Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam, or Taiwan, each of which lay claim to strategic territory in the South China Sea that the People s Republic seized and turned into forward air and naval bases. Rice suggested that Trump s  realists  decided to  lump  Beijing in with Moscow, not because it is a rising military and economic power, but because they wanted to  placate  American nationalists. Though this White House declined to defibrillate the Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade agreement back to life when it inherited its corpse, it has done a far more comprehensive job of working with Beijing to isolate Pyongyang than Obama did. As the North Korean nuclear crisis intensifies, China has backed fresh sanctions on North Korean financial institutions, cut off all access to Chinese iron, lead, and coal, and may even scale back petroleum deliveries to the Stalinist state by as much as 90 percent. And all in the space of one year.Rice contended that the document failed to itemize the discrete identities on whose behalf the U.S. should labor: LGBT people, people in poverty, people with AIDS, people under 30, et cetera. Rather, the document insists that all mankind, regardless of conditions or accidents of birth, are objects of U.S. interest. Rice complained that climate change is no longer viewed as a threat to national security. Good. Climate change is not itself a threat to American national security but a threat multiplier, as the weather has always been. Save for some valid concerns about the prospect of an overly restrictive immigration policy and the precariousness of U.S. free-trade obligations, Rice painted a picture not of a radical administration but one that is returning to a familiar status quo ante. In nearly all respects, it was Obama s White House, not Trump s, that adopted an ideological foreign policy and rendered the U.S. and the world less safe as a result.Even as early as March of 2017, it was clear that the Obama administration s foreign-policy professionals were quite insecure about how posterity would remember their stewardship of American interests abroad. They had every reason to be. For now, at least, the Trump administration has declined to govern as Trump campaigned; not as a populist firebrand but a conventional Republican. Susan Rice and her former White House colleagues have every reason to worry, but not for the United States. Their reputations, however, are another matter entirely.To read the entire article, click here. ",politics,"Dec 23, 2017"
"MARINE CORPS GENERAL WARNS U.S. TROOPS: Theres A War Coming","While the mainstream media remains transfixed on a phony Trump-Russian collusion story, they completely ignore the real news, about how things appear to be heating up between Russian President Vladimir Putin and the U.S.A Marine Corps commandant on Thursday warned U.S. troops stationed in Norway to be prepared for a coming war.Neller pointed to the near future possibility of Russia and the Pacific theater being the next major areas of conflict.Sgt. Maj. Ronald Green sounded a similar tone. Just remember why you re here,  Green said.  They re watching. Just like you watch them, they watch you. We ve got 300 Marines up here; we could go from 300 to 3,000 overnight. We could raise the bar. The warnings came a day before Defense Secretary Jim Mattis told troops at Fort Bragg, N.C., that  storm clouds are gathering  over the Korean Peninsula.Whether the comments were more than motivational rhetoric remained unclear.Neller and Green s arrival in Norway coincided with heightened tensions between the U.S. and its NATO allies and Russia. According to Military.com, Russia warned Norway that its decision to host a new unit of U.S. troops through the end of 2018 would negatively affect relations. FOX NewsAccording to UK Express, Russian President Putin said the US missile defense sites in Romania containing interceptor missiles could also house ground-to-ground intermediate-range cruise missiles, which would be in violation of the 1987 Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty.He told the military officials that both the US and NATO have been  accelerating build-up of infrastructure in Europe  and emphasised that the deployment of NATO forces near Russia s borders had threatened its security.He said:  When we move military units on our own territory, they present it as some kind of a threat. And when they move military bases, infrastructure and new weapons near our borders they present it as something normal. It s probably normal for those who do it, but not for us. NATO has deployed military units to Poland and the Baltics to reassure allies worried over Russia s intentions following its 2014 annexation of Ukraine s Crimea and its support for pro-Russia separatists in eastern Ukraine.Mr Putin mentioned NATO s US-led missile defense system and efforts to develop new prospective conventional weapons among other security challenges.He added:  They are searching for some violations on our part while consistently infringing on it themselves. All that seriously affects security in Europe and in the whole world. Mr Putin accused the US of violating a landmark Cold War-era nuclear arms pact and harbouring aggressive intentions, and pledged to fend off any potential threats.FOX News  At a Q&A session with the troops in the Norwegian Home Guard base near Trondheim, Neller said that the U.S. could shift its focus from the Middle East to Eastern Europe, citing Russia s conflicts with Ukraine and Georgia as justification. He told the Marines that they should be prepared for a  big-ass fight  on the horizon.Russia has reportedly been uneasy about the presence of American troops close to its borders. The 300 U.S. Marines deployed to Norway in June 2016 were the first foreign troops allowed to operate in the country since World War II.In September of this year, Russia conducted a joint-military exercise with neighboring Belarus that involved 12,700 troops.A new National Security Strategy unveiled by the Trump administration on Monday singled out Russia and China as two world powers challenging  American power, influence, and interests, attempting to erode American security and prosperity.

"A YOUNG DONALD J TRUMP: The 34-Year Old Shares His Views on Politics, Leadership, and a Vision for Americas Renewal in 1980 [Video]","The video below is a much watch! A young Donald J. Trump speaks about leadership and politics long before he ran for president. His insight and thoughtfulness are there in a more soft spoken manner than today. Enjoy!Below this video is commentary from the interviewer many years later.INTERVIEWER RONA BARRETT 40 YEARS LATER:Many people may not remember but nearly 40 years ago then-businessman and developer Donald Trump was questioned about whether he would want to be President of the United States someday.His answer then might surprise you now.NewsChannel 3 sat down with world renown journalist and former gossip columnist Rona Barrett, who honed her journalist craft interviewing the rich and famous from the late 1950s to the early 1990s.Barrett reflected back on 1980. She had just launched a pilot program, zeroing-in on America s self-made millionaires. Her first guest was developer Donald Trump. He had a very spicy reputation way back in the 70s,  Barrett said.  He was flamboyant, in that the press made him that kind of a guy. If I look back now, He was very much like he is today. By then, Trump was on his way to becoming a billionaire. He was 34 years old. He was one of the first people, if not the first person, who ever bought the air over a major facility in Manhattan,  Barrett said.  I think it was Bonwit Teller (a luxury department store) at the time. He bought the air to build something above the place he couldn t buy! I had never heard of anyone buying air! It was Trump s first network interview. And it was done in his opulent, 66-floor penthouse. Gold in certain places, real gold in certain places,  Barrett remembered.  I mean, this fellow knew how to live a very rich life. KEYT s Beth Farnsworth sat with Barrett in the lobby of the Golden Inn and Village senior community she built in the Santa Ynez Valley. She looked back at the man she interviewed, for two hours, all those years ago. He was charming,  Barrett said.Then, she reflected on the man leading our country today. I didn t see any of the bravado that I see now. That 1980 interview between Barrett and Trump is now in demand, worldwide, all because of that one question. It just popped out of my mouth. Would you like to be President of the United States? He looked at me and he said,  No . The clip reveals a few of the reasons Trump did not embrace a presidency at the time. I see it as being a mean life and I also see it as somebody with strong views and somebody with the kind of views that are maybe a little bit unpopular, which might be right,  Trump said. And he made some sort of comment about he didn t like the attitude of political people, having to smile and be with babies,  Barrett added.At the time, Trump said he didn t feel America was  going forward  in a  proper direction  and was using very little of its  potential  as a nation. It should really be a country that gets the respect of other countries,  Trump told Barrett.He was highly critical of the handling of the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis. He also said,  There are many more people who are far more qualified to be President than I am .  Barrett remembered.Yet, he refused to name names. The one man could turn this country around,  Trump said during the interview.  The one proper President could turn this country around. Barrett did some more reflecting during NewsChannel 3 s interview, then offered a personal opinion while admitting that she s no doctor or expert. I ve always had another feeling after that interview with Donald as I was talking to him,  Barrett reflected.  I always have felt that he was trying to prove to daddy that he could be bigger and better than daddy ever could. Fred Trump was a highly successful real estate developer, mostly in New York City, and a philanthropist; but he was never President of the United States.Barrett said she was surprised when the elder Trump s son, Donald, announced his bid to run. I didn t think of him as presidential,  Barrett said.Today, Barrett stops short when it comes to labeling Donald Trump as a  good  or  bad  President. I d rather not comment. I m not a political person. I m just another human being,  Barrett said.Read more: keyt",politics,"Dec 23, 2017"
"BREAKING: FBI ARREST STOPS Horrific San Francisco MASS CASUALTY Christmas Day Attack By MUSLIM, Truck Driver and Former Marine Sharpshooter","Truck attacks are becoming increasingly popular with Muslim extremists as a way to threaten large groups of people in popular areas. Meanwhile, the US Appeals Court has just ruled President Trump s travel ban violates federal law and goes beyond  the scope of his delegated authority. The ban, which targets people from six Muslim-majority countries, should not be applied to people with strong US connections, the court said.Breitbart News   The FBI announced on Friday that it arrested California tow truck driver Everitt Aaron Jameson for plotting a Christmas terror attack on Pier 39 in San Francisco.In statements to undercover informants, Jameson outlined a plan that would have involved running civilians down with his truck, deploying improvised explosives, and using his skills as a Marine sharpshooter to increase the body count. A note he evidently intended for publication after the attack swore allegiance to ISIS and cited President Donald Trump s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel as a reason for his actions.FBI documents state that Jameson planned to use his tow truck for a mass-casualty attack on Pier 39 because he  had been there before and knew it was a heavily crowded area.  He reportedly said Christmas would be  the perfect day to commit the attack. I m glad to know we Muslims are finally hitting back. Allahu Akbar! The kuffar deserve everything and more [for] the lives they have taken,  he allegedly told an FBI informant after the November 2 truck jihad attack in New York City, which killed eight people. Allahu akbar! It says he was one of us. May Allah grant him Jannah firtuidus Amin,  he said of New York City truck terrorist Sayfullo Saipov, indicating that he hoped Saipov would enter paradise as a reward for attacking the infidels.Jameson also reportedly spoke approvingly of the attack on a Christmas party by a husband-and-wife jihadi team in San Bernardino in December 2015 and suggested his operation would include vehicles, explosives, and firearms. He told an undercover agent that America  needed another attack like New York or San Bernardino. Communicating with FBI assets he believed were representatives of the Islamic State, Jameson advertised himself as a military veteran and offered to put his skills at the service of the caliphate. In a meeting with undercover informants, he added that he was  well versed  in the Anarchist Cookbook, a manual for making bombs and other implements of terrorism. He also offered financial assistance to ISIS, offered to travel to Syria if needed, and said he was ready to die for  the cause.  He demonstrated fluency in spoken Arabic during a telephone call. I was a soldier in the kuffar army before I reverted,  he said.  I have been trained in combat and things of war. Inshallah, anything of that nature, as well as funding. Anything for Allah. The FBI confirmed that Jameson attended U.S. Marine Corps basic training and earned a  sharpshooter  rifle qualification. He was eventually discharged for  fraudulent enlistment,  apparently because he failed to disclose a history of asthma to the recruiters.When the undercover FBI operatives asked what he needed for the attack, Jameson outlined an ambitious plan involving M-16 and/or AK-47 rifles, timers, remote detonators, and pipe bomb materials.When a search warrant was executed at Jameson s residence in Modesto, a number of pistols, rifles, and ammunition were confiscated, along with his last will and testament and a handwritten letter he signed as  Abdallah abu Everitt ibn Gordon al-Amriki.  The letter was evidently meant to be published after he carried out his terror attack. It reads:I, Abdallah adu Everitt ibn Gordon, have committed these acts upon the Kuffar, in the name of Dar al Islam, Allahu Akbar! You all have brought this upon yourselves. There is no innocent Kuffar! Each and every Kuffar in this Nationalistic, Godless society has a hand in this. You ve allowed Donald J. Trump to give away Al Quds to the Jews. Both You and he are wrong, it belongs to the Muslemeen. We have penetrated and infiltrated your disgusting country. These Acts will continue until the Lions of Islam overtake you. Turn to Allah, make tawbah and fight with us, the soldiers who fight in the day and the night. Allah SWT is most forgiving. I am not. Long live Isil, Long Live Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Allahu akbar!Dar al Islam means the  house of Islam.  Kuffar is a derogatory term for non-Muslims. Al Quds is an Arabic name for Jerusalem. Muslemeen is another way of saying  Muslim  Tawbah means  repent.  Allah SWT is a shorthand way of saying  Allah the most glorious and exalted.  Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi is the  caliph  or leader of the Islamic State.According to the FBI, Jameson was a voracious consumer of Islamic State propaganda online, and wrote numerous  social media posts that are supportive of terrorism.

"JUST IN: SUSPECTED LEAKER and Close Confidant of James Comey Has Been Reassigned From His Post As TOP FBI Lawyer [VIDEO]","On December 5, 2017, Circa s Sara Carter warned there would be a major shake-up at the FBI after the Inspector General s report was completed. So far, Sara Carter has been right on everything she s reported on, as it relates to the Mueller investigation. In the video below, Carter tells Sean Hannity why she believes the FBI will have a major shake-up soon there are 27 leakers that the IG is looking at! Yes, 27 leakers!Sara Carter: We re going to see parts of that report before December (end of the month). We re going to see other parts of his report coming out after January. And they re looking at Peter Strzok. They re looking at Comey. They re looking at 27 leakers. It would not surprise me if there was a shake-up at the FBI and a housecleaning.Watch:Is the FBI s former top attorney, James Baker, one of the first  leaker  casualties?  James Baker, the FBI s leading lawyer who was a confidante of fired FBI Director James Comey, has been reassigned from his post, as the agency s top personnel are under high scrutiny.Baker told colleagues he will assume different duties for the bureau, the Washington Post reported.Baker oversees the bureau s Office of General Counsel and has received such awards as the George H.W. Bush Award for Excellence in counter-terrorism in 2006.He also was the subject of a leak investigation over the summer after Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered a crackdown on leakers.The FBI had no comment when asked why Baker was being reassigned and what he would be doing.His reassignment comes at a time of increased scrutiny and pressure on the agency, following the release of private text messages between agents working in the Hillary Clinton email probe.   Daily Mail Three sources, with knowledge of the investigation, told Circa that Baker is the top suspect in an ongoing leak investigation, but Circa has not been able to confirm the details of what national security information or material was allegedly leaked.A federal law enforcement official with knowledge of ongoing internal investigations in the bureau told Circa,  the bureau is scouring for leakers and there s been a lot of investigations. The revelation comes as the Trump administration has ramped up efforts to contain leaks both within the White House and within its own national security apparatus.Baker is a close confidant of former FBI Director James Comey, and recent media reports suggested he was reportedly advising the then-FBI director on legal matters following private meetings the former director had in February with President Trump in the Oval Office.Baker was appointed to the FBI s general counsel by Comey in 2014 and has had a long and distinguished history within the intelligence community.",politics,"Dec 23, 2017"
"TRUMP RUFFLES FEATHERS With New And Bold Presidential Challenge Coin","Who knew that members of a presidential administration can have coins made to hand out.  Challenge coins  are given out and received by different people like first responders or the military . President Trump has the challenge coins he has received displayed in the Oval Office.Coin collector John Wertman shows his  very gold  Trump challenge coin:HOW THEY GOT THEIR START:Challenge coins got their start as military baubles bearing division insignia and presented by officers to troops for exemplary service. The moniker came from a tradition in which service members challenged one another to produce their coins. Those who did not have one had to buy a round of drinks.For two decades, the commander in chief has doled out distinguished-looking coins as personal mementos. Now, the presidential  challenge coin  has undergone a Trumpian transformation.The presidential seal has been replaced by an eagle bearing President Trump s signature. The eagle s head faces right, not left, as on the seal. The 13 arrows representing the original states have disappeared. And the national motto,  E pluribus unum    a Latin phrase that means  Out of many, one    is gone.Instead, both sides of the coin feature Trump s official campaign slogan,  Make America Great Again. The aide said the president, whose real estate properties are known for their gilded displays of wealth and status, was personally involved in redesigning the coin. Trump, who also had a hand in creating his famous red campaign hat,  wanted to weigh in on it,  the aide said.  It s beautifully made. FEATHERS RUFFLED: Ethics experts  are all aflutter because President Trump used his political slogan on the coin: For the commander in chief to give a political token with a campaign slogan on it to military officers would violate the important principle of separating the military from politics, as well as diminishing the tradition of the coin. There is also dispute about who pays for the coins. As it turns out, the Republican Party is paying for the coins.Yes, the coin is very gold and big but it is Trump s style. It s interesting to note the coins of Obama and Trump reflect each president.Read more: Boston Globe",politics,"Dec 23, 2017"

O Donnell broke the law when she offered to pay two Republican lawmakers for voting against Trump s tax cut bill on Twitter. Even offering this is illegal.

"OOPS! Emails Prove Woman Who Accused Trump Of Sexual Assault In The 1990s Is A Phony&Tried to Get A Job On Trumps Campaign That Would Require Her To Be Close To Him","Just a few months before reports of her sexual assault lawsuit against Donald Trump rocked the campaign, cosmetics executive Jill Harth lobbied to be the then-candidate s make-up artist.On Monday, The Hill detailed the story of Harth s repeated efforts to become Trump s campaign makeup artist and to pitch her new male cosmetics product line,  Made Man.  Her solicitations, in both emails and in person, came a few months before her 1997 lawsuit was brought to light, along with several other sexual misconduct allegations against the candidate. The Hill learned of her appeals to Trump in an interview with Harth in December about her friendship with celebrity attorney Lisa Bloom; Trump s lawyers then provided the emails. The Hill followed up with Harth, who defended both her attempts to work with the man she accused of sexual assault and her current call for him to be impeached.In 1997, Harth sued Trump for allegedly pushing her up against a wall and trying to get his hands up her dress during a meeting at Mar-a-Lago in 1993. She eventually withdrew the lawsuit as part of a settlement over Trump allegedly pulling out of a business deal. But as The Hill notes, the tone of her emails to Trump in 2015 was  starkly different  than the tone of her 1997 lawsuit and the interviews she gave about it in 2016.The Hill provides some examples of the emails Harth personally sent to Trump between the summer of 2015 and early 2016: Hi Donald, you are doing a tremendous job of shaking things up in the United States. I am definitely on Team Trump as so many others are,  Jill Harth wrote the future president in an Oct. 1, 2015, email sent to him through his New York company s headquarters. I can t watch television without seeing you or hearing your name everywhere! It s a good thing for sure but PLEASE let me do your makeup for a television interview, a debate, a photo session, anything!  Harth wrote. It kills me to see you looking too orange and with white circles under the eyes. I will get your skin looking smoother and even toned,  she added, boasting she would  sculpt your face  to look good on high-definition television sets.The Hill also notes that Harth is one of the accusers who financially benefited from her work with Bloom on the allegations: the attorney set up a GoFundMe page for Harth that paid off her mortgage and an email revealed that Harth s sales soared after Bloom appeared on TV to discuss her allegations.  Daily WireBIG PAYDAYS FOR TRUMP ACCUSERS:According to FOX News, Legal powerhouse Lisa Bloom tried to line up big paydays for women who were willing to accuse President Trump of sexual misconduct during the final months of last year s election, according to an explosive report.Proud to call Attorney @LisaBloom my friend. She is very warm, smart, caring, & REAL. Watch her interview on  The View . You ll see what I mean. She even mentions me. pic.twitter.com/rAW9CvxGYn  Jill Harth (@jillharth) November 11, 2017The Hill reported Friday that Bloom worked with campaign donors and tabloid media outlets to arrange compensation for the alleged victims and a commission for herself, offering to sell their stories. In one case, Bloom reportedly arranged for a donor to pay off one Trump accuser s mortgage and attempted to score a six-figure payment for another woman. The former ultimately declined to come forward after being offered $750,000, the clients told The Hill. ",politics,"Dec 20, 2017"
"NUMEROUS CONFLICTING STATEMENTS: Deputy FBI Director in Hot Water After Testimony [Video]"," While we re really not surprised by the  conflicting  statements by Andrew McCabe, we just can t believe another type of conflict wasn t an issue long ago. He took hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations from the Clintons for his wife s campaign. It doesn t take a rocket scientist to understand that this is a conflict of interest and wrong on every level. Please see our previous report below on McCabe s involvement in his wife s run for Virginia state senate in 2015.FOX News reports:Congressional investigators tell Fox News that Tuesday s seven-hour interrogation of Deputy FBI Director Andrew McCabe contained numerous conflicts with the testimony of previous witnesses, prompting the Republican majority staff of the House Intelligence Committee to decide to issue fresh subpoenas next week on Justice Department and FBI personnel.Investigators say McCabe recounted to the panel how hard the FBI had worked to verify the contents of the anti-Trump  dossier  and stood by its credibility. But when pressed to identify what in the salacious document the bureau had actually corroborated, the sources said, McCabe cited only the fact that Trump campaign adviser Carter Page had traveled to Moscow. Beyond that, investigators said, McCabe could not even say that the bureau had verified the dossier s allegations about the specific meetings Page supposedly held in Moscow.The sources said that when asked when he learned that the dossier had been funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, McCabe claimed he could not recall   despite the reported existence of documents with McCabe s own signature on them establishing his knowledge of the dossier s financing and provenance.FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe testifies behind closed doors on Capitol Hill. pic.twitter.com/GHjihJkmz4  FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) December 19, 2017OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON MCCABE:Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe is being investigated by the Office of U.S. Counsel violating the Hatch Act according to a new report by Circa News.The Hatch Act prohibits FBI agents from campaigning in partisan races. Photos of McCabe campaigning for his wife raised questions about McCabe s compliance with the law.Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe is being investigated by the Office of U.S. Special Counsel for violating The Hatch Act that prohibits FBI agents from campaigning in partisan races.The Office of U.S. Special Counsel, the government s main whistleblower agency, is investigating whether FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe s activities supporting his wife Jill s Democratic campaign for Virginia state senate in 2015 violated the Hatch Act s prohibition against FBI agents campaigning in partisan races.The agency s probe was prompted by a complaint in April from a former FBI agent who forwarded social media photos showing McCabe wearing a T-shirt supporting his wife s campaign during a public event and then posting a photo on social media urging voters to join him in voting for his wife. I am voting for Jill because she is the best wife ever,  McCabe put on a sign that he photographed himself holding. The photo was posted on her social media page a few days before the election, in response to Dr. Jill McCabe s plea to  help me win  by posting photos expressing reasons why voters should vote for her, according to the complaint.Other social media photos in the complaint showed McCabe s minor daughter campaigning with her mother, wearing an FBI shirt, and McCabe voting with his wife at a polling station.Here is another social media photo of our acting #FBI director, #AndrewMcCabe breaking the rules by campaigning on social media. #Corrupt pic.twitter.com/hBCH29yErY  Senator Dick Black (@SenRichardBlack) May 9, 2017The Hatch Act prohibits FBI employees from engaging  in political activity in concert with a political party, a candidate for partisan political office, or a partisan political group.

"PROGRESSIVE DE BLASIO VISITS IOWA: Denies Hes Running For President&So He Just Wanted To Visit Iowa?","Soooo, NYC Mayor de Blasio wants you to believe he just wants to visit Iowa. He s been running for President since before he became Mayor, that s why he ran for Mayor. And even in progressive NYC, everyone still despises him for doing nothing. And yes, he s further left than Hillary and Obama.Via Free Beacon: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D.) on Tuesday repeatedly denied that he is running for president in 2020 during a trip to Iowa, a state that automatically begs questions about White House ambitions if politicians head there. No,  de Blasio said.  I m not running for president. The New York Times noted, however, that de Blasio made Iowa his first stop since his easy re-election to the mayorship. The Iowa caucuses launch the nominating process each presidential election cycle, so any jaunts to the midwestern state attract attention.The Washington Post described the far-left mayor as fielding versions of the 2020 question throughout the day. He described himself as focused on his second term.De Blasio is a total phony HERE S A PREVIOUS REPORT ON DE BLASIO S  PROGRESSIVE  AGENDA:Why would anyone expect anything else from a mayor who criticized Barack Obama for being  too conservative  and  too afraid to take the bold kind of action that President Roosevelt took  during the Great Depression. Last week, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio unveiled a 13-point national  Progressive Agenda  that is being touted as the liberal  Contract with America. The aim is for the  Progressive Agenda  to become the basis for the Democratic Party s main economic policies, including those of its 2016 presidential candidate.De Blasio has compared his plan to the  Contract with America,  a document released by the Republican Party during the 1994 congressional election and drawn up by future House Speaker Newt Gingrich to serve as the GOP policy agenda.Now WND documents that most of the 13 points in de Blasio s  Progressive Agenda  can also be found in the manifestos and literature of the Communist Party USA and the Socialist Party USA.The full progressive plan, entitled,  The Progressive Agenda to Combat Income Inequality,  can be found on the agenda s new website.Here is a comparison of the Agenda s plan with literature from the manifestos and writings of the Community Party USA, or CPUSA, and the Socialist Party USA, or SPUSA.  Progressive Agenda:  Raise the federal minimum wage, so that it reaches $15/hour, while indexing it to inflation. SPUSA:  We call for a minimum wage of $15 per hour, indexed to the cost of living. CPUSA: Calls for  struggles for peace, equality for the racially and nationally oppressed, equality for women job creation programs, increased minimum wage.   Even with ultra-right control of the Federal government, peoples legislative victories, such as increasing the minimum wage, can be won on an issue-by-issue basis locally, statewide, and even nationally.  Progressive Agenda:  Pass comprehensive immigration reform to grow the economy and protect against exploitation of low-wage workers. SPUSA:  We defend the rights of all immigrants to education, health care, and full civil and legal rights and call for an unconditional amnesty program for all undocumented people. We oppose the imposition of any fees on those receiving amnesty. We call for full citizenship rights upon demonstrating residency for six months. CPUSA: Declares the  struggle for immigrant rights is a key component of the struggle for working class unity in our country today.  Progressive Agenda:  Make Pre-K, after-school programs and childcare universal. SPUSA:  We support public child care starting from infancy, and public education starting at age three, with caregivers and teachers of young children receiving training, wages, and benefits comparable to that of teachers at every other level of the educational system.  Progressive Agenda:  Earned Income Tax Credit.   Implement the  Buffett Rule  so millionaires pay their fair share. SPUSA:  We call for a steeply graduated income tax and a steeply graduated estate tax.  CPUSA:  No taxes for workers and low and middle income people; progressive taxation of the wealthy and private corporations.  Dems hail  beginning of revolution De Blasio criticized Obama as  too conservative  to assert a progressive economic vision and  too afraid to take the bold kind of action that President Roosevelt took  during the Great Depression, reported the liberal news network.Speaking at the  Progressive Agenda  launch event outside the Capitol building last Tuesday, de Blasio said  something is changing in America. It s time to take that energy and crystallize it into an agenda that will make a difference,  he said.  We ll be calling on leaders and candidates to address these issues, to stiffen their backbones, to be clear and to champion these progressive policies. Read more at WND ",politics,"Dec 20, 2017"

"WISCONSIN PRIEST COMES OUT AS GAY During Sunday Mass&Gets Standing Ovation&Wait&What?","In 1992, the Vatican under Pope John Paul II published the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which stated, among many other things, that  homosexual tendencies  are  objectively disordered.  One of the principal theologians who shaped the document was Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, who would succeed John Paul II as Pope Benedict XVI. He too would take a hard-line stance against homosexuality.Two decades later, Pope Francis has signaled what many believe to be a softening on the matter.In 2013, when asked about gay priests, he famously replied,  Who am I to judge?  He has continued to call for the Catholic Church to treat LGBT people with dignity and respect, and to fight discrimination against sexual minorities.  RNSFrom the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel   The Rev. Gregory Greiten told his congregation Sunday,  I am Greg. I am a Roman Catholic priest. And, yes, I am gay! The priest in the Milwaukee Archdiocese serves as the pastor of St. Bernadette Parish. On Monday, he came out to the rest of the world with a column in the National Catholic Reporter. He received a standing ovation from his parishioners when he made his announcement before the column s publication.Greiten said he was breaking the silence of gay men in the clergy so he could reclaim his own voice.While it is established that there are gay men who serve as priests, it is rare for a priest to come out to his congregation in this way. Greiten shares an estimate in his article that there are between 8,554 and 21,571 gay Catholic priests in the United States from  The Changing Face of the Priesthood.  Church theology teaches that acting upon homosexuality is a sin.In announcing his identity as a gay man, Greiten chastised the Catholic Church for its stance on homosexuality.He wrote: By choosing to enforce silence, the institutional church pretends that gay priests and religious do not really exist. Because of this, there are no authentic role models of healthy, well-balanced, gay, celibate priests to be an example for those, young and old, who are struggling to come to terms with their sexual orientation. This only perpetuates the toxic shaming and systemic secrecy. NYP-Greiten wrote that has decided to stand with the  few courageous priests who have taken the risk to come out of the shadows and have chosen to live in truth and authenticity. The church s silent stance on gay priests perpetuates toxic shaming and systematic secrecy, Greiten wrote. The church needs healthy role models for priests who are struggling to come to terms with their sexual orientation, he said.Greiten met with Milwaukee Archbishop Jerome Listecki before coming out, according to an archdiocese spokeswoman. We support Father Greiten in his own personal journey and telling his story of coming to understand and live with his sexual orientation,  Listecki said in a statement Monday.  As the Church teaches, those with same-sex attraction must be treated with understanding and compassion. ",politics,"Dec 20, 2017"

It certainly was nice of James to add that he s been  well-spoken,  in addition to being outspoken.The three-time NBA champ and future Hall of Famer continued,  No matter the skin color, no matter the race, no matter who you are, I think we all have to understand that having equal rights and being able to stand for something and speak for something and keeping the conversation going. James did not elaborate on what rights he felt were in danger, nor did he explain exactly what  the conversation  was, or where it was going.However, James did speak from a place of unrivaled authority on the subject of being outspoken. In many ways, James has been the anti-Jordan, whereas MJ avoided political entanglements whenever possible, at least since 2012, James has embraced them whenever and wherever possible.James appeared in a photo with his teammates wearing hoodies in honor of Trayvon Martin, a black teenager shot to death by George Zimmerman in 2012.

"FORMER DNC AIDES In Hot Water Over Possible Money Laundering Scheme to Fund Terrorism Overseas","The plot thickens with the saga of the IT workers who worked for Democrats like Debbie Wasserman Schultz.  They had access to congressional emails and were quite shady. They made millions just disappear. Is this a case of money laundering to fund terrorism?The Daily Caller s Luke Rosiak described it best with this tweet: Need to take $100k in Hezbollah-linked cash while you can read intelligence committee members  emails, as their IT guy? Set up a used car dealership with fake staff, launder it from Iraq thru realtors commissions, and lie about it on House disclosures. Daily Caller reports:The used car dealership known as CIA never seemed like an ordinary car dealership, with inventory, staff and expenses.On its Facebook page, CIA s  staff  were fake personalities such as  James Falls O Brien,  whose photo was taken from a hairstyle model catalog, and  Jade Julia,  whose image came from a web page called  Beautiful Girls Wallpaper. If a customer showed up looking to buy a car from Cars International A, often referred to as CIA, Abid Awan   who was managing partner of the dealership while also earning $160,000 handling IT for House Democrats   would frequently simply go across the street to longstanding dealership called AAA Motors and get one. If AAA borrows a car to Cars International and they have a customer, it was simply take the car across the street and sell it, and then later on give the profit back or not,  Nasir Khattak, who ran the longstanding AAA dealership, testified in a lawsuit.  There was no documentation which is write every transaction that takes place.   If you go and try to dissect, you will not be able to make any sense out of them because there were many, dozens and dozens, of cars transferred between the two dealerships and between other people. Khattak did not explain why he would ruin his existing business to help the Awans.  All of those transactions was to support Cars International A from AAA Motors,  he testified.  That s why I did not make any money from my dealership because my resources were supporting Cars International A. He said only Imran Awan knew what became of the money.  It was Imram, [Abid] Awan s brother, who was running the business in full control,  he said.Imran Awan and his family members were congressional IT aides who investigators said made unauthorized access to the House Democratic Caucus server thousands of times. At the same time as they worked for and could read all the emails of members of the House intelligence, homeland security and foreign affairs committees, they also ran a car dealership that took money from a Hezbollah-linked fugitive and whose financial books were indecipherable and business patterns bizarre, according to testimony in court records.While Imran and Abid Awan ran their car dealership in Falls Church, Va. in the early part of the decade, Drug Enforcement Agency officials a few miles away in Chantilly were learning that the Iranian-linked terrorist group frequently deployed used car dealerships in the US to launder money and fund terrorism, according to an explosive new Politico expose.The money that disappeared between the Awans  dealership, some $7 million in congressional pay, the equipment suspected of disappearing from Congress under their watch, and their other side businesses   all while they displayed few signs of wealth and frequently haggled in court over small amounts of money   raise questions about whether the Awans might have been laundering money or sending it to a third party.",politics,"Dec 19, 2017"

The term  asset  refers to people with countries or organizations being spied upon who serve as resources for outside spies.Clapper appeared on CNN to discuss Trump s national security strategy speech given Monday, where he referred to Russia as a rival but also said he wanted to form a partnership.The two leaders have also expressed recent gratitude to each other, with Putin calling and thanking Trump for sharing intelligence that helped foil a terror plot and Trump thanking Putin for his recent praise of the American economy.IS THIS GUY KIDDING:This is on the same day that we learn the following about the Obama administration:The Obama administration intentionally derailed investigations into the terrorist group Hezbollah s drug trafficking operation to secure the Iran nuclear deal, according to a new bombshell report.Politico spoke with several members of Project Cassandra, a joint effort between the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Pentagon that was founded in 2008 under the Bush administration to identify and prosecute a drug trafficking, money laundering, and smuggling operation run by the Iranian-backed militants.Over the next eight years, agents working out of a top-secret DEA facility in Chantilly, Virginia, used wiretaps, undercover operations, and informants to map Hezbollah s illicit networks, with the help of 30 U.S. and foreign security agencies.They followed cocaine shipments, some from Latin America to West Africa and on to Europe and the Middle East, and others through Venezuela and Mexico to the United States. They tracked the river of dirty cash as it was laundered by, among other tactics, buying American used cars and shipping them to Africa.

"TRUMPS NATIONAL SECURITY SPEECH Reveals Policy Based on 4 Principles Focusing on America First","President Trump delivered a speech on national security that ll knock your socks off. He plans on putting America first: America is in the game and America is going to win.  His strategy involves four basic principles: protecting the homeland by restricting immigration, pressuring trading partners, building up the military and otherwise increasing U.S. influence globally.What s not to love about that? MAGA!Via Fox News: President Trump on Monday unveiled a national security strategy that enshrines his  America First  approach into U.S. policy, stressing American strength and economic security and putting rivals like China and Russia on notice. America is in the game and America is going to win,  Trump said, making clear that the United States will stand up for itself even if that means acting unilaterally or alienating others on issues such as trade, climate change and immigration.In a 20-minute speech, Trump said the U.S. faces  an extraordinarily dangerous world  and one of his goals is to make sure the U.S. is  leading again on the world stage. America is coming back, and America is coming back strong,  he said.Trump, who released his 68-page national security strategy ahead of his speech, said he is making good on campaign pledges that he promised would  revitalize the American economy, rebuild our military, defend our borders, protect our sovereignty and advance our values. Trump s national security strategy, a document mandated by Congress, is based on four principles: protecting the homeland by restricting immigration, pressuring trading partners, building up the military and otherwise increasing U.S. influence globally.Trump also took on the rise in North Korea s nuclear aggression and painted China and Russia as U.S. rivals despite his own relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, which included two telephone calls last week.Bryan Llenas has the rogue regime s reaction.  China and Russia challenge American power, influence, and interests, attempting to erode American security and prosperity,  the strategy document says.  They are determined to make economies less free and less fair, to grow their militaries, and to control information and data to repress their societies and expand their influence. The strategy accuses the two nations of  developing advanced weapons and capabilities that could threaten our critical infrastructure and our command and control architecture. While Trump in his address did not mention Russia meddling in U.S. elections, the written strategy also calls out Moscow for  using information tools in an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of democracies  and says adversaries like Russia  target media, political processes, financial networks and personal data. In a shift from the last administration, Trump s strategy also refers to the  jihadist  terror threat and  Islamist  terror groups. We will pursue threats to their source, so that jihadist terrorists are stopped before they ever reach our borders,  it says.Further, the strategy backs off naming climate change as a major threat. The last such strategy document, prepared by then-President Barack Obama in 2015, declared climate change an  urgent and growing threat to our national security. ",politics,"Dec 18, 2017"
"YOULL NEVER GUESS Who The New York Times Is Blaming For North Koreas Decades-Long Famine","After North Korea s most recent missile launch, the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong Un claimed he had  finally realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force.  US Defense Secretary James Mattis claimed that North Korea now has the ability to hit  everywhere in the world. Meanwhile, the New York Times is blaming the Trump administration for starving the North Koreans, after placing stricter sanctions on the rogue nation.The left-leaning New York Times bizarrely claimed this week that the decades-long famine plaguing North Korea is not the fault of its brutal communist regime, but most likely due to American interference and foreign policy, saying the  hunger is devastating. And it s our fault. The article, published over the weekend, lays the blame of millions of starved and tortured North Koreans at the feet of the American administration, saying the US and its allies have  crippled  Kim Jong Un s ability to feed his own people. Led by the United States, the international community is crippling North Korea s economy,  writes the author.  In August and September, the United Nations Security Council passed resolutions banning exports of coal, iron, lead, seafood and textiles and limiting the import of crude oil and refined petroleum products. The United States, Japan and South Korea have each imposed bilateral sanctions on Pyongyang to further isolate the country. We are trying to inflict pain on the North Korean regime to stop the development of nuclear weapons and missiles. That s understandable. But in the process, we are also punishing the most vulnerable citizens and shackling the ability of humanitarian agencies to deliver aid to them,  the author adds.North Korea s massive food shortages date back to the 1990s when dictator Kim Jong Il s regime was incapable of handling droughts and other natural disasters that cut dwindling food supplies by over 30%.

"JUST IN: OBAMA REGIME Demanded Homeland Security Officials Stop Using Sharia and Jihadist Language&Look Who Just Changed That Language [VIDEO]","President Trump addressed the America people today, as he outlined a new and bold national security strategy. The American people are generous. You are determined, you are brave, you are strong, and you are wise. When the American people speak, all of us should listen. And just over one year ago, you spoke loud and you spoke clear. And On November 8th, 2016, you voted to Make America Great Again. You embraced new leadership, and very new strategies, and also a glorious new hope, that is why we are here today. But to seize the opportunities of the future, we must first understand the failures of the past. America  will pursue threats to their source, so that jihadist terrorists are stopped before they ever reach our borders. Legal Insurrection reports- The White House has unveiled President Donald Trump s national security strategy. It has four main points: Protect America, promote our prosperity, preserve peace through strength, and advance our influence.But one of the biggest points is the return of using  jihadist  and  Sharia,  language President Barack Obama s administration tried to avoid.From Fox News: The primary transnational threats Americans face are from jihadist terrorists and transnational criminal organizations,  the document states, according to excerpts released ahead of the speech.A search of the document shows the word jihadist appears 24 times in the 68 page document. Obama s 2015 national security strategy mentioned Islam twice.The document mentions that America  will pursue threats to their source, so that jihadist terrorists are stopped before they ever reach our borders. Trump listed the ways to do this: disrupt terror plots, take direct actions, eliminate terrorist safe havens, sever sources of strength, share responsibility, and combat radicalization & recruitment in communities.David Reaboi at Security Studies Group noted another massive change:Here is my favorite part of the National Security Strategy and it s MASSIVE Admin acknowledges Sharia is goal and driving force behind Islamist terror groups. Obama effectively banned use of any of this terminology. pic.twitter.com/2HVHhnVqjX  David Reaboi (@davereaboi) December 18, 2017He is correct. Back in January 2016, Homeland Security released a report that called for officials to stop using jihad and sharia. The Washington Free Beacon reported at the time:Under the section on terminology, the report calls for rejecting use of an  us versus them  mentality by shunning Islamic language in  Countering Violent Extremism  programs, or CVE, the Obama administration s euphemism that seeks to avoid references to Islam.Under a section on recommended actions on terminology, the report says DHS should  reject religiously-charged terminology and problematic positioning by using plain meaning American English. Government agencies should employ  American English instead of religious, legal and cultural terms like  jihad,   sharia,   takfir  or  umma,  states the June 2016 report by the Council s countering violent extremism subcommittee. The DHS report stated that to avoid a confrontational  us versus them  stance in public efforts to counter Islamic radicalization, government programs should use the term  American Muslim  instead of  Muslim American. The Obama administration insisted on this even though ISIS made it NO secret that they wanted the world to live under Sharia law. The terrorist group even formed an all female brigade to help enforce Sharia law through brutal and violent means. ",politics,"Dec 18, 2017"

By putting themselves between the DEA and Hezbollah, the Obama administration helped the militant group grow into a global security threat that is suspected of designing IEDs used to kill American troops, the report said. Donald Trump s White House slapped at his predecessor Sunday night, with press secretary Sarah Sanders tweeting that the story shows a contrast of  President Trump s success against ISIS vs. President Obama s appeasement of terrorists. And a Republican House leadership aide told DailyMail.com on Monday that the Obama White House  was the worst of the worst when it came to fighting terrorism in the ways that mattered most. The Drug Enforcement Administration led a complex venture called Project Cassandra to tackle the criminality of the Lebanese militant group from 2008 on.But it is claimed Obama s people threw down a number of roadblocks, effectively paving the way for Hezbollah s illegal activities including cocaine smuggling into the US which agents believe raked in $1 billion for the terror group.

They serially ripped apart this entire effort that was very well supported and resourced, and it was done from the top down. He added that the closer Obama came to finalizing the Iran nuclear deal, the more difficult the DEA s job became.The weapons agreement was announced in January 2016, which coincided with Project Cassandra officials being moved on to other assignments.

"HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE? LATINO IMMIGRANT, ANTI-TRUMP Activist Group With Ties To George Soros and ACORN Awarded More Than $25 MILLION In Taxpayer Funds","The fact that it has taken so long to uncover massive taxpayer funds being used to directly target our President and one of two major political parties in America should frighten ever taxpaying American.WFB   A liberal activist group that has been involved in direct action campaigns against President Donald Trump and Republicans was recently awarded $400,000 more in taxpayer-backed government grants, records show.Make the Road New York (MRNY), a New York City-based Latino immigrant group with nearly 20,000 dues-paying members, is closely linked to an $80 million dollar anti-Trump network and an approved funding group of the Democracy Alliance, a secretive liberal donor network.MRNY has already hauled in millions of dollars in government grants. Between 2002 and 2014, the group was the recipient of more than $20 million in grants, the Washington Free Beacon previously reported. The amount that they received in 2015 and 2016 are not fully known, given the group s most recently available tax form is from 2014.According to USASpending, a site that tracks federal government grants, MRNY was given $725,000 in grants in 2015 and more than $4.4 million in 2016. However, figures on the site show only a fraction of the total amount in government grants the group has received in previous years as marked on their tax forms.On August 10, MRNY was awarded another grant totaling $420,000 from the Department of Education, records show.MRNY was behind the widely covered protests at the JFK airport following Trump s initial travel ban. The protests, which were billed as spontaneous at the time, were later found to be in the works since one day after the presidential election.The group was involved in the #DeleteUber campaign after Uber allowed drivers to pick up passengers from the airport during the protests. Travis Kalanick, Uber s founder, stepped down from Trump s advisory council following the activist campaign.MRNY was also a part of the #GrabYourWallet campaign, which targeted retailers that sold Trump family products. Nordstrom dropped Ivanka Trump products following the campaign, but cited declining sales as the reason why it had made the decision.MRNY has  partnered  with the Center for Popular Democracy, a New York-based liberal nonprofit that contains old chapters of the controversial and now-defunct Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), on a  Corporate Backers of Hate  campaign that targeted companies the group s claimed could profit from Trump s policies.The Center for Popular Democracy refers to MRNY as its  sister  organization in the biography of Ana Maria Archila, one of its co-executive directors, on its website. The two groups have swapped a number of individuals throughout recent years. Archila was the co-executive director of MRNY prior to her current position.Andrew Friedman, the other co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy, founded MRNY in 1997 and spent years building up the organization before moving to the Center for Popular Democracy. Friedman also sits on the board of directors of MRNY.Javier Valdes, the co-executive director of MRNY, sits on the board of directors of the Center for Popular Democracy.The groups have additionally transferred hundreds of thousands of dollars to each other. In 2013, MRNY passed $122,112 to the Center for Popular Democracy. In 2014, MRNY gave the group $25,000, according to tax forms.The Center for Popular Democracy sent $253,900 to MRNY in 2013 with another $100,000 going to its action fund. The Center for Popular Democracy then sent $286,042 to MRNY in 2015.The Center for Popular Democracy s action fund is also spearheading a massive $80 million dollar anti-Trump network that will span across 32 states with 48 local partners.Members of the Democracy Alliance, a secretive network of deep-pocketed liberal donors that was co-founded by billionaire George Soros, are recommended to donate to the Center for Popular Democracy, which receives generous funding from Soros.

It says Fusion recklessly spread the charges to journalists.FUSION GPS FEELS THE KARMA:Fusion GPS, the producer of the infamous fake Trump dossier, is fending off in court three of Russia s richest oligarchs by painting them as corrupt bankers in bed with President Vladimir Putin.The three primary investors in Moscow s Alfa Bank   Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven and German Khan   filed a libel lawsuit against Fusion in October. Fusion s dossier, written by former British spy Christopher Steele, says two of them engineered cash bribes to Mr. Putin. The dossier also implies that the bank colluded with Mr. Putin to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election by hacking Democratic Party computers.The lawsuit describes the three billionaires as international businessmen who became  collateral damage  in Fusion s war to destroy the Donald Trump campaign. This is a defamation case brought by three international businessmen who were defamed in widely disseminated political research reports commissioned by political opponents of candidate Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election cycle,  says a Dec. 12 filing in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The reports are gravely damaging in that, directly or by implication, they falsely accuse the plaintiffs   and Alfa, a consortium in which the plaintiffs are investors   of criminal conduct and alleged cooperation with  Kremlin  to influence the 2016 presidential election,  says the complaint by the New York law firm Carter Ledyard & Milburn.Fusion responded in court by relying on Wikipedia and its press citations to paint a dark picture of three oligarchs who, the media say, capitalized on Russia s freewheeling post-communism era to engage in financial scandals. Fusion depicted the three as publicity-seeking financial titans who are public figures under U.S. law.Unlike private citizens, public figures face a high bar in libel lawsuits. In this case, the Russian businessmen, if deemed public figures, must prove that Fusion spread the dossier charges with malice   meaning the opposition research firm knew its accusations were untrue or showed reckless disregard for the truth.THREE BILLIONAIRES: Mikhail Fridman, Petr Aven and German Khan are three of the most prominent oligarchs in Russian history,  the Fusion memo states.  With their incredible wealth and political power, each has had a pronounced influence on the economic and political affairs of Russia.   Any search returns an avalanche of articles about their business endeavors, their wealth, their political and economic power, their close relationship with the Kremlin and their misconduct. At issue is Mr. Steele s September 2016 writings devoted to Alfa (which he wrongly spells Alpha), one of 17 memos making up the dossier from June to December 2016.He states that the Alfa Bank paid  illicit cash  directly from Mr. Fridman and Mr. Aven to Mr. Putin via Oleg Govorun, now a senior Kremlin figure,  throughout the 1990s. Mr. Govorun s official resume states that he was an executive for Alfa only from 1997 to 2000.Mr. Steele titled the September memo,  Presidential Election: Kremlin-Alpha Group Co-Operation.

"GUATEMALAN MAN DIES After Falling Into WASTE GRINDER At Meat Plant&Former Worker Claims They Hire 90% Illegal Aliens&Including 10-12 Yr Old Kids","This story is absolutely horrific, but not surprising. Bleeding heart liberals aren t doing illegal aliens any favors by fighting for them to come here, only to be abused by their employers, who hire them, and then hold their illegal immigration status over their heads when they demand safer working conditions. (See video below)A worker caught in a machine at a meat processing plant has died in Ohio, according to local authorities.Samuel Martinez, 62, was killed by the machine on Saturday afternoon at the Fresh Mark plant in Canton, Ohio.The  Guatemalan national  died at the scene.According to the Stark County Coroner s Office, the man stepped into a chute and was stuck in the waste grinder.In a statement released on Saturday, Fresh Mark said that they would work with local law enforcement to figure out what caused the accident.This afternoon just before 5 pm, we experienced a work-related fatality at our Canton facility, they said. Our primary concern rests with the wellbeing of this employee s family, as well as with the safety and well-being of all our employees in the Canton and other Fresh Mark facilities. We are working with authorities to determine the facts regarding this incident. The incident marks the second of such to happen at the company.In 2011, an employee was electrocuted while trying to plug in a fan as he was standing in water.The company sells pork related meat under the Superior and Sugardale brands.  Daily Mail In 2011, Steve Salvi, the founder of Ohio Jobs & Justice PAC interviewed an Ohio worker that made some startling allegations regarding the alleged hiring of underaged illegal aliens at one of Fresh Mark s Sugardale meatpacking plants in Canton, Ohio. In addition to outing the company for hiring underage illegal alien workers, the former Fresh Mark employee claims a veteran returned from Iraq and applied for a job at the meat processing company. The veteran was allegedly turned down until he could prove that he spoke the Spanish language.In May 2017, the very liberal New Yorker published a story about a 17-year old Guatemalan boy who was too young to work in a factory, and lost his leg due to the unsafe working conditions at neighboring Case Farms in Ohio. The New Yorker says the Case Farms plants are among the most dangerous workplaces in America.Osiel sanitized the liver-giblet chiller, a tublike contraption that cools chicken innards by cycling them through a near-freezing bath, then looked for a ladder, so that he could turn off the water valve above the machine. As usual, he said, there weren t enough ladders to go around, so he did as a supervisor had shown him: he climbed up the machine, onto the edge of the tank, and reached for the valve. His foot slipped; the machine automatically kicked on. Its paddles grabbed his left leg, pulling and twisting until it snapped at the knee and rotating it a hundred and eighty degrees, so that his toes rested on his pelvis. The machine  literally ripped off his left leg,  medical reports said, leaving it hanging by a frayed ligament and a five-inch flap of skin. Osiel was rushed to Mercy Medical Center, where surgeons amputated his lower leg.Case Farms plants are among the most dangerous workplaces in America. In 2015 alone, federal workplace-safety inspectors fined the company nearly two million dollars, and in the past seven years, it has been cited for two hundred and forty violations. That s more than any other company in the poultry industry except Tyson Foods, which has more than thirty times as many employees. David Michaels, the former head of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), called Case Farms  an outrageously dangerous place to work.  Four years before 17 year old Guatemalan worker, Osiel L pez P rez lost his leg, Michaels s inspectors had seen Case Farms employees standing on top of machines to sanitize them and warned the company that someone would get hurt. Just a week before Osiel s accident, an inspector noted in a report that Case Farms had repeatedly taken advantage of loopholes in the law and given the agency false information.  The company has a twenty-five-year track record of failing to comply with federal workplace-safety standards,  Michaels said.Case Farms has built its business by recruiting some of the world s most vulnerable immigrants, who endure harsh and at times illegal conditions that few Americans would put up with. When these workers have fought for higher pay and better conditions, the company has used their immigration status to get rid of vocal workers, avoid paying for injuries, and quash dissent. Thirty years ago, Congress passed an immigration law mandating fines and even jail time for employers who hire unauthorized workers, but trivial penalties and weak enforcement have allowed employers to evade responsibility. Under President Obama, Immigration and Customs Enforcement agreed not to investigate workers during labor disputes. Advocates worry that President Trump, whose Administration has targeted unauthorized immigrants, will scrap those agreements, emboldening employers to simply call ice anytime workers complain.",politics,"Dec 17, 2017"

"BERNIE SANDERS Just Proved His Cluelessness on What Makes Economies Grow [Video]","Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) said Sunday Democrats would  absolutely  raise the corporate tax rate if they take back control of Congress. If the Democrats take control of the Senate, and you caucus with the Democrats, what s the promise to America about what will be done to reverse the state of affairs that you re so unhappy with?  CBS host John Dickerson asked on  Face The Nation. Sanders jumped into income inequality before changing the subject to child health care and the  Dreamers  before being interrupted by Dickerson to re-ask the original question. If Democrats take control, are corporate taxes going up?  Dickerson asked. I think we re going to take a very hard look at this entire tax bill and make it a tax bill that works for the middle class, and working families, not for the top one percent and large multinational corporations,  Sanders said.Dickerson continued to press Sanders for an answer to Democrats raising corporate tax if they were to take control after the 2018 elections. The Republican tax bill that could pass this week lowers the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent.Sanders is clueless when it comes to business and taxes probably because he has been on the government dole for life.

"WATCH: Democrat Heads Are Exploding After What Newly Elected Alabama Senator Doug Jones Just Said In Defense Of President Trump and His Supporters"," The newly elected US Senator Doug Jones (D-AL) just won the election by a small margin in a state where a Republican hasn t won for 25 years. Jones was pegged as a  liberal  and a  pro-abortion  by his opponents in the highly contentious race against the accused sexual predator, and ultra-conservative candidate, Roy Moore. Jones, however, is no dummy. In a deep-red state who voted overwhelmingly for President Trump in 2016, Jones knows that he will be a one-term senator unless he gets behind the wildly popular Donald Trump, and based on his first interview with the press, that s exactly what he plans to do.Senator-elect Doug Jones is already breaking with some prominent Democrats by refusing to call for President Trump to step down over ongoing sexual harassment allegations. I don t think that the president ought to resign at this point,  Jones (D-Ala.) told CNN s  State of the Union. In his first round of Sunday show interviews since securing a stunning victory in red state Alabama over accused sexual predator Roy Moore, Jones said he doesn t want to get bogged down in Trump s sexual harassment allegations and would rather work on  real issues. I think we need to move on and not get distracted by those issues,  Jones added.  Let s get on with the real issues that are facing the people of this country right now. That s at odds with some high-profile Democrats like Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (NY) and Cory Booker (NJ) who believe the president should step down because at least 19 women have accused Trump of sexual misconduct.Unlike other politicians who have stepped down, like Sen. Al Franken and Rep. John Conyers, Jones said the difference is the voters knew about these allegations and still elected Trump to the highest office. Those allegations were made and he was elected president of the United States,  Jones said.  I think the American people spoke. Jones said he s willing to work with Republicans on passing some of Trump s priorities like infrastructure investment said the sexual harassment allegations are not reason to get on Trump s bad side. We need to move on and try to work with some real issues that are facing the country and not worry about getting at odds with the president any more than we have to,  Jones said.Gillibrand last week said Trump  committed assault  according to the  very credible allegations  and  he should resign. Trump, who has routinely denied any wrongdoing, shot back at the junior senator with what was widely panned as a sexually suggestive tweet Tuesday   the same day Democrats turned out in droves for Jones in Alabama to defeat a Trump-backed candidate.

"JUST IN: DISGRACED DEMOCRAT HARRY REID Funneled MASSIVE Taxpayer Funds To Donor For UFO Research Through SECRET Defense Department Program","The Defense Department secretly set up a program ten years ago to investigate unidentified flying objects, or UFOs, at the urging of then-Democratic Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, according to new reports.Both The New York Times and the website Politico published stories Saturday revealing the existence of the Pentagon s now-defunct Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program.The New York Times said the UFO program began in 2007, while Politico reported in began in 2009.According to the reports, Reid, a Nevada Democrat, helped steer money under the program to a donor s aerospace research company.A Pentagon spokesman said the UFO program ended in 2012, though The New York Times said the Defense Department still investigates potential episodes of unidentified flying objects. The Advanced Aviation Threat Identification Program ended in the 2012 timeframe,  Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White told Politico.  It was determined that there were other, higher-priority issues that merited funding and it was in the best interest of the DoD to make a change. White added:  The DoD takes seriously all threats and potential threats to our people, our assets, and our mission and takes action whenever credible information is developed. Politico said the program was not classified but few officials knew about it. Reid secured the funding for the program in 2009 with the help of former Hawaii Democratic Sen. Daniel Inouye and former Alaska Sen. Ted Stevens, who have both since died.Both outlets said Reid s interest in UFOs was the result of friend, and donor Bob Bigelow, who owns Bigelow Aerospace and has said before he is  absolutely convinced  aliens exist and UFOs have visited Earth.The New York Times said the program had a $22 million annual budget and  most of the money  went to Bigelow s research company, which hired subcontractors and solicited research for the program. I m not embarrassed or ashamed or sorry I got this thing going,  Reid told the newspaper.  I think it s one of the good things I did in my congressional service. I ve done something that no one has done before. Both outlets said the person who ran the program, Luis Elizondo, resigned in October and complained about a lack of interest from top officials about it.   FOX News",politics,"Dec 17, 2017"
"BIZARRE 2006 FILM Starring Former White House Staffer OMAROSA Surfaces With Crazy Plot Around Stealing Donald Trumps Hair","There are conflicting reports about why the outrageous Omarosa Manigault Newman is leaving her undefined job at the White House. It was first reported that she was escorted out of the White House by Secret Service after General Kelly had enough of her nonsense, and fired her. Omarosa appeared on Good Morning America the following day to refute those claims, saying she resigned from her job and was not fired or escorted out of the White House as reported. So who is Omarosa, and why is she such a polarizing figure? Does this 2006 video that just emerged offer any clues?A pop-culture polymath sent Page Six a link to  Soul Sistahs,  an ultra-camp, hyper-kitsch, uber-low-budget 10-minute sci-fi short film.While the plot is virtually incomprehensible, as far as we can tell it focuses on an intergalactic yenta in a housecoat who kidnaps Omarosa in an attempt to steal Donald Trump s hair as part of a difficult-to-understand get-rich-quick scheme.The mini-flick was made back in 2006   two years after Omarosa shot to fame on Trump s NBC show  The Apprentice.

"FOX NEWS BOMBSHELL REPORT: Trump Transition Team Lawyer Accuses Robert Mueller Of Improperly Obtaining Documents Related To Russian Probe","On Friday, Democrats were doing their best to push a rumor that President Trump is about to fire special counsel Robert Mueller before Christmas. According to The Hill   Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA), a member of the House Intelligence Committee, said Friday that  rumors  on Capitol Hill suggest President Trump could fire special counsel Robert Mueller before Christmas, after Congress leaves Washington for the winter recess. The rumor on the Hill when I left yesterday was that the president was going to make a significant speech at the end of next week. And on Dec. 22, when we are out of D.C., he was going to fire Robert Mueller,  Speier told California s KQED News.The ranking Democrat on the committee, Rep. Adam Schiff (Calif.), also said Friday that he is worried that Republicans leading the committee are seeking to shut down the committee s investigation by the end of the year. Republicans have scheduled no witnesses after next Friday and none in 2017 [sic].

We understand that the special counsel s office has subsequently made extensive use of the materials it obtained from the GSA, including materials that are susceptible to privilege claims,  Langhofer writes.The transition attorney said the special counsel s office also received laptops, cell phones and at least one iPad from the GSA.Trump for America is the nonprofit organization that facilitated the transition between former President Barack Obama to President Trump.The GSA, an agency of the United States government, provided the transition team with office space and hosted its email servers.

Unfortunately for McDowell, his disrespectful interaction with the female law enforcement officer who was attempting to arrest him for disorderly conduct was all caught on camera and shared with TMZ.From Deadspin: The video features a male officer who appears to be tasked with transporting McDowell, but not the one who originally arrested him putting handcuffs on McDowell. At the same time, McDowell is taunting a female cop standing nearby. Are you scared of me?  he asks her repeatedly.  Why is you a cop then? McDowell and the officer go back and forth about why he was arrested for disorderly conduct, and he calls her a bitch multiple times. Bitch, I got money. That s why I can talk shit,  McDowell says, adding that the officers will never make as much money as he s made in the past few months.McDowell then apparently shouts at some passersby,  Hey, they re trying to plant some shit on me!  which causes the officers to laugh. I got a lot of fucking money you broke-ass niggas,  McDowell says as they search him.  Put me in fucking jail, please, so I can bond out.

"Liberal, Man-Hating Movement DESTROYS Career Of Top TX Lawyer For Posting #MeToo Letter From A Rape Survivor: If everyone is a victim, no one is. Victim means nothing anymore"," Lauren McGaughy of The Dallas Morning News did a disgusting hit job on a top Texas lawyer and former judge. As a mother of 3 girls, I m offended by  journalists  like Lauren McGaughy, who wrote about a lawyer who was fired from his law firm for posting an article written by a rape survivor about her views on the now hijacked feminazi #metoo movement. It s sad to see the left grabbing onto the serious issue of sexual assault and doing the exact same thing they did to racism, using it as a political football, and trying to make it a Republican or conservative thing. If everyone s a racist, then no one is a racist. Lauren McGaughy, a reporter for Dallas Morning News didn t stop at exposing the firing of a top Texas lawyer over an article he shared on his personal Facebook page about the #MeToo movement (that was written by a rape survivor), she went after him with a bizarre vengeance, as though she had been personally harmed by his words. McGaughy didn t stop after pointing out that his law firm fired Andrew D. Leonie in a shameful case of censorship, she went on to tie him to  conservatives  and prove that he s actually (gasp) supported Republican candidates in the past.  McGaughy took it a step further, and provided evidence that this horrible human being was also involved in litigating a case against are you ready? Muslim students praying in public schools!McGaughy wrote: Leonie was behind an AG s office letter that blasted a Frisco-area high school for allowing Muslim students to use an empty classroom to pray. The letter, which alleged the school might be infringing on the constitutional rights of its non-Muslim students, was called a  political stunt  by district staff who said the room was open to all students.From the Dallas Morning News article:A top lawyer in the Office of Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton resigned Thursday after reports he wrote a Facebook post that called women s sexual misconduct allegations  pathetic. The Dallas Morning News reported Thursday morning Associate Deputy Attorney General Andrew D. Leonie posted on Facebook this week:  Aren t you also tired of all the pathetic  me too  victim claims? If every woman is a  victim , so is every man. If everyone is a victim, no one is. Victim means nothing anymore. The post went up at 2:40 a.m. on Wednesday. By Thursday afternoon, Leonie had resigned. In a press release, Paxton s office said Leonie s exit was effective immediately. The views he expressed on social media do not reflect our values,  Paxton s Director of Communications Marc Rylander wrote.  The OAG is committed to promoting and maintaining a workplace that is free from discrimination and harassment. Leonie s post was removed late Thursday afternoon. His bio was changed from  Associate Deputy Attorney General  to  Retired. The Dallas Morning News was fortunately, able to get a screen shot of the offensive post for everyone to see:His Facebook post linked to an article from the conservative website The Federalist titled,  Can we be honest about women?  The teaser to the article, which was written by a woman, states:  Here s a little secret we have to say out loud: Women love the sexual interplay they experience with men, and they relish men desiring their beauty. He previously worked for Paxton s predecessor, Gov. Greg Abbott, as a regional chief for consumer protection and special litigator, according to Leonie s LinkedIn. His salary was listed as $150,984 in April on the Texas Tribune s salary explorer.Leonie s post comes as some conservatives question the increasing number of sexual harassment and assault claims against the nation s most powerful men in media, politics and business. While the stories have led to a number of high-profile resignations and apologies in the private sector, change is slower in the political realm, where it s usually up to voters to oust elected officials accused of sexual misconduct.In Texas, for example, Republican Congressman Blake Farenthold on Thursday decided not to run for reelection after allegations he made lewd comments and unleashed profanity-laced tirades on staffers. The decision was made after Farenthold declined to resign for weeks after news broke he once used $84,000 in taxpayer money to settlement a harassment claim. Accusations against state lawmakers   as well as concerns over the ability of elected officials to harass with impunity   have also led to new training requirements in the Legislature.OOPS! It looks likeThe Federalist-reported that Leonie s Facebook post linked to an article entitled  Can We Be Honest About Women?  authored by McAllister, who is a survivor of sexual assault. Here s a little secret we have to say out loud: Women love the sexual interplay they experience with men, and they relish men desiring their beauty,  McAllister writes.  Why? Because it is part of their nature. As a society, we need to encourage both sexes to become comfortable with who they are naturally and all the messy, uncomfortable, stumbling, tantalizing, and glorious twists and turns that come with it,  she continues.  Men and women need to show each other grace and respect as they engage as sexual beings in whatever sphere they interact. The article explicitly condemns sexual assault but argues that what some call sexual assault doesn t deserve that label and expanding its definition into innocent behavior hurts both men and women. In the past, McAllister has written about how our society has emboldened men in positions of power to think they can get away with sexually harassing or assaulting women.In a post entitled  It s Not Up To Women To End Sexual Harassment,  she explains why men need to step up their efforts to protect women from such evils. She has also criticized aspects of the #MeToo movement, writing recently that it is destroying trust between men and women because the social media movement denies human nature.The sexual tension between men and women will always exist, and if women assume a man s sexuality is a threat instead of a powerful complement to their own sexuality, they will always be on guard. In this environment of suspicion, there can be no privacy between a man and a woman. If there is any kind of interaction or discourse, even if it s not sexual, the man can t trust that the woman won t use it against him so communication is silenced. Fear is generated on both sides, and fear is the death of trust. It is also the death of love.Throughout McAllister s critiques of the #MeToo movement and discussions of sexual topics, she has repeatedly stated that women ought to be respected and that sexual assault and sexual harassment are wrong   a fact left out of the numerous media accounts of Leonie s resignation and her article.",politics,"Dec 16, 2017"

Change.org has a petition calling for her impeachmentA SUPPORTER COMMENT OF THE PETITION:  There is Clear and Present Danger, in our Government and to our Country. Judge Chutkin needs to do her duty, as Sworn by Oath, to let in ALL of the evidence pertaining to Imran Awan and Hina Alvi. As it stands today, 9/12/2017, Judge Chutkin is not doing her duty to protect the interests and lives of the Citizens of The United States. For this reason, I am standing with others, shoulder to shoulder, and calling for the Removal and Impeachment of Federal District Judge Tanya S. Chutkin. Aleksej Gubarev, a Russian tech executive accused in the dossier of hacking Democrats  computer systems, has sought to subpoena Fusion GPS records and to depose its employees to find out more about the research firm s work on the dossier.Gubarev is suing BuzzFeed for defamation for publishing the dossier earlier this year. He denies the allegations laid out in the document, which was written by former British spy Christopher Steele.Chutkan recused herself last month from another case involving Fusion GPS. The firm had filed suit against its bank, TD Bank, to keep it from complying with a subpoena issued by the House Intelligence Committee, which sought Fusion s bank records.Chutkan presided over that case from Oct. 20 to Nov. 9. It was reassigned to Judge Richard Leon, a George W. Bush appointee. Since taking over the case, Leon has indicated that he plans to allow more transparency into the court proceedings involving the battle over Fusion s bank records. He has ordered several documents be unsealed and made public.Chutkan has presided over the case involving the lawsuit against BuzzFeed since Aug. 31. Her replacement is Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee who assumed office in October.The reasons for Chutkan s recusals remain a mystery Chutkan refused to comment on the recusal but her work with a medical technology firm also represented by Fusion GPS could be the reason.In any case, this is yet another case of the Obama hand in just about everything that has to do with corruption and intel agencies.Read more: Daily Caller",politics,"Dec 16, 2017"
"SPOT ON! TRUMP SUPPORTER Slams New World Of Guilty Until Proven Innocent Being Used To Oust Trump [Video]","This is so worth the watch! Brit Paul Joseph Watson slams the left and their desire to invalidate the wishes of the people when they voted to elect Trump:This is one guy to follow on YouTube. Paul Joseph Watson gets to the point every time. In the second half of the video, he addresses Brexit.This comment by Jim O Connor is spot on: If our votes get to the point that they really don t matter, then paying taxes and obeying laws really won t matter then. These so called  good people  are tyrants, who want to enslave all of humanity. In 1776 a group of imperfect people stood up against such tyranny. Tyranny similar to the CIA running drugs to destroy people and fund themselves, Soros buying elections and influence, the banksters funding war, the propaganda media (no news). I hope Trump shuts down the federal reserve, shuts down the CIA and corrupt FBI, issues US currency, and puts the Satanic pedophiles in the worst prisons possible for the rest of their miserable lives. If he doesn t, the deep (creep) state will destroy his family in front of his eyes. Those in the Cabinet who voted to have Trump declared incompetent, need to be in front of a Marine firing Squad. This sedition cannot stand.  We ve been following Watson for some time. Here s a good and very funny example:",politics,"Dec 16, 2017"
"JUST IN: TRUMP Will Remove Climate Change From List Of National Security Threats","Thank goodness we finally have a President who refuses to dump our taxpayer funds into climate scam that our former President actually identified as a national security threat According to The Federalist, The Trump administration will reverse course from previous Obama administration policy, eliminating climate change from a list of national security threats. The National Security Strategy to be released on Monday will emphasize the importance of balancing energy security with economic development and environmental protection, according to a source who has seen the document and shared excerpts of a late draft. Climate policies will continue to shape the global energy system,  a draft of the National Security Strategy slated to be released on Monday said.  U.S. leadership is indispensable to countering an anti-growth, energy agenda that is detrimental to U.S. economic and energy security interests. Given future global energy demand, much of the developing world will require fossil fuels, as well as other forms of energy, to power their economies and lift their people out of poverty. During his successful campaign, Trump mocked Obama s placement of climate change in the context of national security. Here s a sample of his approach from a campaign speech in Hilton Head, South Carolina, in late 2015:So Obama s always talking about the global warming, that global warming is our biggest and most dangerous problem, OK? No, no, think of it. I mean, even if you re a believer in global warming, ISIS is a big problem, Russia s a problem, China s a problem. We ve got a lot of problems. By the way, the maniac in North Korea is a problem. He actually has nuclear weapons, right? That s a problem.We ve got a lot of problems. We ve got a lot of problems. That s right, we don t win anymore. He said we want to win. We don t win anymore. We re going to win a lot   if I get elected, we re going to win a lot. (Applause)We re going to win so much   we re going to win a lot. We re going to win a lot. We re going to win so much you re all going to get sick and tired of winning. You re going to say oh no, not again. I m only kidding. You never get tired of winning, right? Never. (Applause)But think of it. So Obama s talking about all of this with the global warming and the   a lot of it s a hoax, it s a hoax. I mean, it s a money-making industry, OK? It s a hoax, a lot of it. And look, I want clean air and I want clean water. That s my global   I want clean, clean crystal water and I want clean air. And we can do that, but we don t have to destroy our businesses, we don t have to destroy our  And by the way, China isn t abiding by anything. They re buying all of our coal; we can t use coal anymore essentially. They re buying our coal and they re using it. Now when you talk about the planet, it s so big out there   we re here, they re there, it s like they re our next door neighbor, right, in terms of the universe.The draft of the National Security Strategy makes this approach policy, emphasizing national security and economic growth over climate change.President Obama made climate change, and the burdensome regulations that accompany its focus, a primary focus of his administration, including in his National Security Strategy released in 2015.  [W]e are working toward an ambitious new global climate change agreement to shape standards for prevention, preparedness, and response over the next decade,  that report said.Watch Barack Obama explain how  climate change  is national security threat: By contrast, President Trump s National Security Strategy will focus on conventional and immediate national security risks. The draft says, in part:North Korea seeks the capability to kill millions of Americans with nuclear weapons. Iran supports terrorist groups and openly calls for our destruction. Jihadist terrorist organizations such as ISIS and al Qaeda are determined to attack the United States and radicalize Americans with their hateful ideology. States and non-state actors undermine social order with drug and human trafficking networks, which drive violent crimes and cause thousands of American deaths each year . Strengthening control over our borders and immigration system is central to national security, economic prosperity, and the rule of law. Terrorists, drug traffickers, and criminal cartels exploit porous borders and threaten U.S. security and public safety. These actors adapt quickly to outpace our defenses.As for climate change, the draft report says  The United States will remain a global leader in reducing traditional pollution, as well as greenhouse gases, while growing its economy. This achievement, which can serve as model to other countries, flows from innovation, technology breakthroughs, and energy efficiency gains  not from onerous regulation. FOX News reported on the NOAA intentional manipulation of data that was given to President Obama and other world leaders prior to the 2015 Paris Climate summit where Western nations agreed to spend billions to combat phony climate change:  ",politics,"Dec 15, 2017"
"KARMA: Race-Obsessed Detroit Free Press Editorial Editor Who Led Effort To Destroy Kid Rocks Career Is FIRED Over Allegations of Inappropriate Behavior With Female Colleagues","In September 2016, Stephen Henderson, the editorial editor of the Detroit Free Press, used the power of his pen to unjustly attack Kid Rock, after liberals feared Rock might actually be serious about running as a Republican contender against the do-nothing Democrat Senator Debbie Stabenow. As a Michigan resident, I can say with a great level of confidence, that besides Mike Illitch, the now deceased owner of the Red Wings and Detroit Tigers, Kid Rock has done more for the city of Detroit and for the black community than almost anyone in this state. When the Illitch s asked Detroit legend and philanthropist, Kid Rock to perform for the opening of their much anticipated Little Caesar s Arena, no one could have dreamed that the Detroit Free Press  Stephen Henderson would have used his position to push a lie, that Kid Rock, the single father of a black son, and NAACP award recipient is a  racist .Here s what Henderson had to say about Kid Rock, the man who has done so much for the city of Detroit:This is a musician who got rich off crass cultural appropriation of black music, who used to wrap his brand in the Confederate flag   a symbol inextricably linked to racism, no matter what its defenders say   and who has repeatedly issued profane denouncements of the very idea of African Americans pushing back against American inequality. Just last week, he trashed Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who s jobless right now because he dared challenge the nation s racism with a silent, kneeling protest during the pre-football game singing of the national anthem. Having Kid Rock open this arena is erecting a sturdy middle finger to Detroiters   nothing less. And the Ilitches, who ve done so much for this city and also taken so much from it, should be the last to embrace that kind of signaling.Here is how Kid Rock responded on his Facebook page:People! Pay NO attention to the garbage the extreme left is trying to create! (and by the way, fuck the extreme left and the extreme right!)They are trying to use the old confederate flag BS, etc. to stir the pot, when we all know none of this would be going on if I were not thinking of running for office. Pretty funny how scared I have them all and their only agenda is to try and label people / me racist who do not agree or cower to them!! No one had a word to say when we sold out the 6 shows at LCA back in January! My track record in Detroit and Michigan speaks for itself, and I would dare anyone talking trash to put theirs up against mine. I am also a homeowner and taxpayer in the city of Detroit, so suck on that too!I am the bona fide KING OF DETROIT LOVE and it makes me smile down deep that you haters know that! Your jealousy is merely a reflection of disgust for your own failures and lack of positive ideas for our city.I am however very disappointed that none of the people, businesses or charities I have so diligently supported in Detroit have had anything to say about all these unfounded attacks from these handful of jackasses and The Detroit Free Press. So for the unforeseen future I will focus my philanthropy efforts on other organizations besides the ones I have supported in the past. I would however employ that NAN go ahead and make up these losses since they claim to be so good for Detroit and do not want me opening the arena and generating tons of jobs and tax dollars for the city and people I LOVE  IDIOTS!  .. (Has Al Sharpton even paid his back taxes yet?)Today, the race-obsessed Stephen Henderson, got some very bad news AP   The Detroit Free Press fired Stephen Henderson, its managing director of opinion and commentary, after finding what it called credible allegations of inappropriate behavior with female colleagues, the newspaper announced Friday.Free Press Editor and Vice President Peter Bhatia announced Henderson s termination in a story that said the allegations go back several years. Gannett Co. Inc., the newspaper s parent company, says Henderson s behavior  has been inconsistent with company values and standards. Henderson said in a statement to The Detroit News and Crain s Detroit Business that he is  stunned. I dedicated 18 years to this newspaper over three decades, all of it performing at the highest level,  Henderson said.  I may have more to say on this later, but for now there is much other work to be done here in the city of Detroit. Stephen is a magnificent journalist and a treasured colleague who has done so much for Detroit,  Bhatia said. He added there were no accusations of sexual assault, but said the incidents involving inappropriate behavior and comments directed at Free Press employees ran counter to company policies.Less than 2 months ago, Henderson appeared on Meet The Press and called America a racist nation with a racist history:Rich Lowry of the National Review appeared with Stephen Henderson on Meet The Press to discuss Colin Kaepernick and other NFL players who disrespect the flag as a way to support Black Lives Matter. Henderson argued,  Some of the words in the national anthem are racist.  Henderson argued that it was appropriate to show disrespect for the American flag because he thinks America is a country whose history is racist. Henderson told the panel,  I think this is a country whose history is racist, whose history is steeped in white supremacy, and the anthem reflects that in its very words   (inaudible) . Lowry responded to Henderson by saying,  It s also a nation with very important ideals that have worn down those injustices over time and created a more just society. And people have died under that flag for those ideals. Watch:",politics,"Dec 15, 2017"

The entire video below is a pitiful display of partisan hackery we ve come to expect from MSNBC.

This is a perfect example of just how off kilter these so-called  journalists  are. Do they not have anything else to report???The New York Times juxtaposed President Donald Trump with Obama on lies told in office in a report Thursday, with the newspaper claiming Obama told 18 distinct falsehoods during his entire presidency compared to Trump s 103 in less than a year in office.The Free Beacon reported that Obama, according to fact-checker PolitiFact, had made 98 separate  mostly false,   false,  and  pants on fire  statements in his administration, with the Times leaving many of them out of its analysis.Carney wrote a piece for the Examiner in which he stated Trump was  far more detached from the truth  than most politicians, but he hit the newspaper for omitting so many of Obama s lies from the piece, such as claiming during a State of the Union address that his administration had eliminated lobbyists from policy-making jobs.Carney said it didn t seem to be a proper use of  data journalism  to say one would count up the lies when it left out so many of Obama s.

"WATCH: ITS THE MOST WONDERFUL TIME OF THE YEAR&Trump Style","With mainstream media and establishment politicians stacked against him from the moment he announced his run for the presidency, Donald J. Trump has been in an ongoing pitched battle to communicate his plans   and his eventual successes   to Americans. Through public rallies and social media, he has managed to bypass the traditional information gatekeepers and has spoken directly to the people.Yet, Americans are subjected to a relentless drumbeat from the Democratic Party, amplified by virtually the entire establishment press, that Trump is not only undisciplined, unfit for office and possibly racist, but that embarrassingly little has been accomplished by the Trump administration.But we  Deplorables  know better When Dana Kamide made this pro-Trump video last year, it was an instant hit. The hilarious video reminded Americans of why we re so blessed to have President Trump as our President. To date, the  It s The Most Wonderful Time Of The Year  viral video has been seen over 5.6 million times. This Christmas, let s all count our blessings and remember to be thankful for the bullet we dodged in 2016.    Enjoy WND   And while he has befuddled and disappointed some   with major promises such as Obamacare repeal and a border wall unfulfilled or put on the backburner   the stunning reality is this: Donald Trump has amassed a long and remarkable list of actions and accomplishments that will surprise average Americans, even those who support the president and consider themselves well-informed politically.Below, is an accounting of the truly significant achievements of the first eight months of the Trump presidency. The accomplishments are all the more noteworthy as they have been carried out in an environment of unrelenting negativity on the part of not only the Democrats and almost the entire news media, but the Beltway establishment itself, the entire donor class, the  Deep State,  and even many Republicans wedded to the D.C.  swamp. DECEMBERRegulatory reform: President Trump announced Dec. 14 his administration has far exceeded its promise to eliminate regulations at a 2:1 ratio and impose no lifetime net regulatory costs. In total, agencies issued 67 deregulatory actions while imposing only three new regulatory actions, a ratio of 22:1. Federal agencies also achieved $8.1 billion in lifetime net regulatory cost savings, the equivalent of $570 million per year. Jobs: Some 228,000 new jobs were created in November, highlighting the strongest U.S. labor market since the turn of the century. The government also reported Dec. 8 that unemployment was unchanged at 4.1 percent, but that s still nearly a 17-year low. Military: The Trump administration asked a federal court Dec. 7 for an emergency stay to delay a court order to begin opening the military to transgender recruits by Jan. 1. Israel: While the previous three U.S. presidents promised during their election campaigns to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital, President Trump on Dec. 6 became the first to follow through. In his official order, Trump also ordered the U.S. Embassy to be moved to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu responded:  President Donald Trump, thank you for today s historic decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital. The Jewish people and the Jewish state will be forever grateful.  Immigration: The Department of Homeland Security released figures Dec. 4 showing Trump is delivering on his pledge to more strictly control immigration and deter would-be border-crossers. Border Patrol arrests dropped to a 45-year low in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, down 25 percent from a year earlier. ICE said the number of people apprehended away from the border jumped 25 percent this fiscal year. The increase is 37 percent after Trump s inauguration compared to the same period the year before. States  rights: President Trump signed two executive orders Dec. 4 that gave back about 2 million acres of land to the state of Utah by modifying executive orders by President Obama. Arguing the Antiquities Act  requires that any reservation of land as part of a monument be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects of historic or scientific interest to be protected,  Trump reduced the federal government s control of the Bear s Ear National Monument to just 201,876 acres, pointing out that the important objects of scientific or historic interest described described in Obama s proclamation are protected under existing laws and agency management designations. He also reduced the Grand Staircase National Monument in Utah from nearly 1.9 million acres to about 1 million. Immigration: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced Dec. 3 the Trump administration is withdrawing from the Global Compact on Migration, arguing the pact would  undermine the sovereign right of the United States to enforce our immigration laws and secure our borders.  Tillerson made the announcement just before the opening of a global conference on migration in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Tax reform: Propelled by the engagement of President Trump, the Senate on Dec. 1 passed the biggest rewrite of the nation s tax system since 1986, reducing rates for businesses and individuals. The Republican-led House passed a similar bill in November. The two chambers of Congress will negotiate a reconciliation of the two bills that they expect to put on the president s desk before the end of the year. Health care: The Senate tax-reform bill passed Dec. 1 eliminates Obamacare s individual mandate, the linchpin of Obama s government-controlled health-care system, which penalizes taxpayers for choosing not to buy health insurance.NOVEMBERStocks: The Dow Jones industrial average surged more than 331 points Nov. 30 to close above 24,000 for the first time in history. Stocks were buoyed by the possibility of the Senate passing the Republican tax-reform bill championed by President Trump. Mining: Mining increased 28.6 percent in the second quarter and was the leading contributor to growth for the nation and in the three fastest-growing states of North Dakota, Wyoming, and Texas, according to the Commerce Department s Bureau of Economic Analysis. North Korea: In response to North Korea s buildup of nuclear weapons and missiles, the communist nation was officially designated a state sponsor of terror by the Trump administration on Nov. 20. The Treasury Department followed up with sanctions on organizations and companies doing business with North Korea. Regulation reform: Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Nov. 17 the Department of Justice will cease the practice initiated by President Obama of issuing  guidance memos  to enact new regulations that sometimes have had the effect of changing federal laws. Iran: Trump issued a memorandum Nov. 16 determining that the U.S. has enough petroleum coming from countries other than Iran to permit  a significant reduction in the volume of petroleum and petroleum products  purchased from the mullah-led nation. China trade: During President Trump s visit to China in November, trade and investment deals worth more than $250 billion were announced that are expected to create jobs for American workers, farmers and ranchers by increasing U.S. exports to China and stimulating investment in American communities. Government transparency: The federal government on Nov. 9 made public more than 13,000 additional documents from its files on President John F. Kennedy s assassination, under orders from President Trump. It was the fourth released since October, when the president allowed the immediate release of 2,800 records by the National Archives. International liberty: President Trump proclaimed Nov. 7, the 100th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution, as the National Day for the Victims of Communism Religious liberty: The Department of Agriculture issued a guidance Nov. 6 that ensures Christians who opposed same-sex marriage would not be discriminated against for their beliefs. Job growth: President Trump announced in the Oval Office Nov. 2 that the semiconductor manufacturing company Broadcom Limited is moving its headquarters from Singapore to the United States. Broadcom is a Fortune 100 company that already employs more than 7,500 workers in the United States, and that number is expected to grow exponentially, with an estimated $20 billion to be spent on employees annually. Broadcom CEO Hock E. Tan said the decision to relocate Broadcom was driven by  his desire to give back to this country that has given me so much.  Government reform: EPA Director Scott Pruitt placed 66 new experts on three different EPA scientific committees who espouse more conservative views than their predecessors. To prevent conflicts of interest, Pruitt signed a directive Oct. 31 banning scientists who receive EPA grants from serving on the agency s independent advisory boards.OCTOBERJob growth: The White House announced Oct. 25 a new drone Integration Pilot Program that will accelerate drone integration into the national airspace system. Under the program, the Department of Transportation will enter into agreements with state, local, and tribal governments to establish innovation zones for testing complex UAS operations and to attempt different models for integrating drones into local airspace. Calling drones  a critical, fast-growing part of American aviation, increasing efficiency, productivity, and jobs, the White House said they  present opportunities to enhance the safety of the American public, increase the efficiency and productivity of American industry, and create tens of thousands of new American jobs.  Government reform: Melania Trump, while embracing a more active and public schedule as first lady, is running one of the leanest East Wing operations in recent history, according to a Fox News analysis of White House personnel reports that found she has significantly reduced the number of aides on the first lady s office payroll in comparison to her predecessor, Michelle Obama. During President Obama s first year in office, 16 people were listed working for Michelle Obama, earning a combined $1.24 million a year. This year, just four people were listed working for Melania Trump as of June, with salaries totaling $486,700. Obamacare: Trump signed an executive order Oct. 12 that directs three federal agencies to rewrite regulations to encourage the establishment of cheaper health plans that can be purchased across state lines and are not bound by certain Obamacare rules and regulations. The directive would allow small-business owners, trade groups and others to join together to purchase health insurance. The plans would not be required to include benefits such as prescription drugs. Trump also wants to expand the sale of stopgap policies that don t cover pre-existing conditions, mental health services and other costly benefits. Consumer optimism: U.S. consumer sentiment unexpectedly surged to a 13-year high as Americans  perceptions of the economy and their own finances rebounded following several major hurricanes, a University of Michigan survey showed Oct. 13. Iran nuclear agreement: President Trump announced Oct. 13 he will not certify the Iran nuclear deal and vowed that the U.S. would pull out unless changes are made. He also unveiled a new strategy, the culmination of nine months of deliberation with Congress and allies, on how to best protect American security from the rogue mullah-led regime. The plan includes denying the regime funding and any paths to a nuclear weapon and ballistic missiles. The Department of the Treasury sanctioned more than 25 entities and individuals involved in Iran s ballistic missile program. The U.S. also sanctioned 16 entities and individuals that have supported Iran s military and Revolutionary Guard Corps in the development of drones, fast attack boats and other military equipment. United Nations: The United States is quitting the United Nations  Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Heather Nauert, a State Department spokeswoman, announced the move will be made before the end of the year  This decision was not taken lightly, and reflects U.S. concerns with mounting arrears at UNESCO, the need for fundamental reform in the organization, and continuing anti-Israel bias at UNESCO.  Homeland security: The Supreme Court dismissed a major challenge to President Trump s travel ban on majority-Muslim countries Oct. 10 because it has been replaced by a new version, sending the controversy back to the starting block. The ruling is a victory for the Trump administration, which had asked the court to drop the case after Trump signed a proclamation Sept. 24 that replaced the temporary travel ban on six nations with a new, indefinite ban affecting eight countries. That action made the court challenge moot, the justices ruled. EPA reform: Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruitt announced Oct. 9 a new set of rules that will override the Clean Power Plan, the centerpiece of President Barack Obama s drive to curb global climate change. The agency is moving to undo, delay or block more than 30 environmental rules, the largest regulatory rollback in the agency s 47-year history. Immigration: The Trump administration submitted to Congress Oct. 8 a 70-point proposal that calls for increased border security, interior enforcement of immigration laws and a merit-based immigration system. It includes funding and completing construction of a southern border wall, improving expedited removal of illegal aliens, protecting innocent people in  sanctuary cities,  ending extended-family chain migration and establishing a point-based system for green cards to protect U.S. workers and taxpayers. Religious liberty: Attorney General Sessions on Oct. 6 issued guidance to all administrative agencies and executive departments regarding religious liberty protections in federal law in keeping with Trump s May 4 executive order. The guidance interprets existing protections for religious liberty in federal law, identifying 20 high-level principles that administrative agencies and executive departments can put to practical use to ensure the religious freedoms of Americans are lawfully protected. Attorney General Sessions also issued a second memorandum to the Department of Justice, directing implementation of the religious liberty guidance within the department. Among the principles are  the freedom of religion extends to persons and organizations,   Americans do not give up their freedom of religion by participating in the marketplace, partaking of the public square, or interacting with government  and government  may not restrict acts or abstentions because of the beliefs they display.  Missile defense: The Department of Defense reprogrammed approximately $400 million for U.S. missile defense systems. Religious liberty: The Trump administration expanded religious and moral exemptions for mandated contraceptive coverage under Obamacare. Obama s signature legislation required that nearly all insurance plans cover abortion-inducing drugs and contraception, forcing citizens to violate sincerely held religious or moral beliefs, pay steep fines, or forgo offering or obtaining health insurance entirely. The interim final rules note that the United States  has a long history of providing conscience protections in the regulation of health care entities and individuals with objections based on religious beliefs and moral convictions.  The rule aligns with the U.S. Supreme Court s unanimous ruling protecting the Little Sisters of the Poor, which says the government cannot fine religious groups for following their faith. Immigration: Amid strong Democratic opposition, the House Homeland Security Committee gave first approval to the broad scope of President Trump s border wall Oct. 4, clearing a bill that would authorize $10 billion in new infrastructure spending, new waivers to speed up construction, and 10,000 more border agents and officers to patrol the U.S.-Mexico line. Space exploration: President Trump revived the National Space Council for the first time in 25 years to assist him in developing and implementing long-range strategic goals for the nation s space policy. The pace program will refocus on human exploration and discovery. Vice President Mike Pence, who chaired the National Space Council s Oct. 5 meeting, said the administration aims to establish a renewed American presence on the moon and from that foundation become the first nation to bring mankind to Mars. The administration also will renew America s commitment to creating the space technology needed to protect national security. And Pence pointed out the intelligence community reports that Russia and China are pursuing a full range of anti-satellite technology designed to threaten our U.S. military effectiveness. Abortion: The Office of Management and Budget on Oct. 2 issued a Statement of Administration Policy (SAP) to strongly support the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (H.R. 36), which would generally make it unlawful for any person to perform, or attempt to perform, an abortion of an unborn child after 20 weeks post-fertilization. Protecting life: The president issued a statement Oct. 1 renewing the nation s  strong commitment to promoting the health, well-being, and inherent dignity of all children and adults with Down syndrome.  The president observed  there remain too many people   both in the United States and throughout the world   that still see Down syndrome as an excuse to ignore or discard human life.  He said Americans and their government  must always be vigilant in defending and promoting the unique and special gifts of all citizens in need  and  should not tolerate any discrimination against them, as all people have inherent dignity.  Protecting life: The Department of Health and Human Services has published a draft of a new strategic plan that states in its introduction that life begins at conception. The personhood of the unborn child is central to the abortion debate   as even the justice who wrote the landmark Roe v. Wade opinion has acknowledged   because, if established in law, it would nullify a  right  to abortion. The largely overlooked HHS strategic plan for 2018-22 states the agency  accomplishes its mission through programs and initiatives that cover a wide spectrum of activities, serving and protecting Americans at every stage of life, beginning at conception.  Tax reform: Trump is working with Congress to lower taxes by seven points for the middle class and lower business taxes to a 15 percent rate.SEPTEMBERLower courts: Trump is filling up lower courts with lifetime appointees. In the estimation of Democratic official Ron Klain, a  massive transformation is underway in how our fundamental rights are defined by the federal judiciary.  Klain, lamenting Trump s moves, said the president  is proving wildly successful in one respect: naming youthful conservative nominees to the federal bench in record-setting numbers.  On Sept. 28, Trump announced an eighth wave of judicial candidates, with nine more names. Canada trade: In September, the Commerce Department, siding with Boeing, slapped a 219 percent tariff on the import of Canadian-made Bombardier jets, arguing they are supported by subsidies from the governments of Canada and the U.K., creating an unfair market. Korea trade: Trump began the process of renegotiating the United States-South Korea Free Trade Agreement in September. Climate: In September, Trump shut down a climate-change advisory panel under the direction of NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, that critics have contended was formed largely to promote President Obama s climate policies, arguing it lacked representation from  those who think the empirical evidence points to human actions contributing little to global warming and that attempting to reduce it would slow the conquest of poverty around the world.  The EPA also has decided not to renew the appointments of dozens of scientists on various scientific advisory panels. Economy: Household wealth reached a record high of $1.7 trillion in the second quarter due to rising property values and gains in financial assets, according to a Federal Reserve report. Homeland security: In September, Trump signed an executive order to enhance vetting capabilities and processes for detecting attempted entry into the United States by terrorists or other public-security threats. North Korea: After some 25 years of failed negotiations to contain Pyongyang s nuclear program, the communist regime s latest threatening actions were met by President Trump with a warning that military action, including a preemptive nuclear attack, would be considered. After Trump s warnings, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un backed off on his threat to attack the U.S. territory of Guam. North Korea: On Sept. 7, the U.S. fully deployed the THAAD missile defense system to South Korea despite objections from Pyongyang s chief ally, China. North Korea: In September, Trump signed an executive order significantly expanding U.S. authority to target individuals, companies and financial institutions that finance and facilitate trade with North Korea, most of which are Chinese. Meanwhile, China s central bank has ordered banks in its massive banking system to immediately stop doing business with North Korea. United Nations: In his first speech to the United Nations General Assembly, Trump told the global body in September,  I put America first and you should do the same with your nations.  In the speech, he also explicitly denounced socialism and communism, pointing to Venezuela as an example of what happens when socialism is successfully implemented. Immigration: President Trump, in September, rescinded Obama s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals order, which gave de facto amnesty to some 800,000 people who came to the country as children with their illegal-alien parents. Trump delayed implementing his order for six months to give Congress time to come up with a legislative solution. Stock markets: Through the first week of September, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had 34 record highs. From Election Day to the Inauguration, the Dow rose more than 1,500 points. It climbed another 2,500 points from Inauguration Day, reaching more than 22,400 in mid-September, a gain of more than $4 trillion in wealth since Trump was elected. The Dow s spike from 19,000 to above 21,000 in just 66 days was the fastest 2,000-point rise ever. The S&P 500 and the NASDAQ also have set all-time highs. On Aug. 7, the Dow closed with an all-time high for the ninth day in a row, the first time the market has had a run of that length twice under one presidency.For the entire list, go to WND ",politics,"Dec 14, 2017"
"WATCH: PRESIDENT TRUMP CHANNELS Successful Developer Days&Cuts Ribbon To Celebrate SHOCKING Number of Regulation Rollbacks&Businesses Cheer!","WASHINGTON   President Trump said on Thursday that his administration was answering  a call to action  by rolling back regulations on environmental protections, health care, financial services and other industries as he made a push to showcase his accomplishments near the end of his first year in office.The remarks highlighted an area where Mr. Trump has perhaps done more to change the policies of his predecessor than any other, with regulatory shifts that have affected wide sections of the economy. We are just getting started,  Mr. Trump said, speaking from the Roosevelt Room of the White House. He described progress so far as the  most far-reaching regulatory reform  in United States history, a claim he did not back up.  In 1960, there were approximately 20,000 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations. Today there are over 185,000 pages, as seen in the Roosevelt Room. Today, we CUT THE RED TAPE! It is time to SET FREE OUR DREAMS and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!A post shared by  President Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on Dec 14, 2017 at 12:39pm PSTEchoing his days as a real estate developer with the flair of a groundbreaking, Mr. Trump used an oversized pair of scissors to cut a ribbon his staff had set up in front of two piles of paper, representing government regulations in 1960 (20,000 pages, he said), and today   a pile that was about six feet tall (said to be 185,000 pages).His efforts   his staff said that the rules already rolled back had saved $8.1 billion in regulatory costs over their lifetime, or a total of an estimated $570 million a year   have brought cheers from the business community, most notably from companies that will benefit from the rollbacks.Several economic indicators   and comments from companies large and small   suggest that a shift in federal regulatory policy is building business confidence and accelerating economic growth, developments Mr. Trump certainly took credit for on Thursday.A survey of chief executives released this month by the Business Roundtable found that, for the first time in six years, executives did not cite regulation as the top cost pressure facing their companies. C.E.O.s appear to be responding to the administration s energetic focus on regulation,  Joshua Bolten, the roundtable s president, said this month.   New York Times ",politics,"Dec 14, 2017"

"JUST IN: FCC VOTES To Repeal Obamas Net Neutrality Rules After BOMB THREAT Clears Room","Today, the FCC voted to repeal the net neutrality rules that govern internet service providers and how they treat certain websites. The left, along with major social media sites like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter were all openly opposed to repealing Obama s net neutrality rules.ABC News   The five commissioners of the FCC voted along party lines   three Republicans to two Democrats   to roll back the rules, imposed in 2015 under President Barack Obama.JUST IN: FCC votes 3-2 to repeal Obama-era #NetNeutrality rules. https://t.co/4VEkXXEf23 pic.twitter.com/M7pYZa4dlT  ABC News (@ABC) December 14, 2017The left reacted to their decision with apocalyptic style tweets.Here s a typical leftist reaction on Twitter to the repeal of Obama s net neutrality:Me after finding out #NetNeutrality was repealed. pic.twitter.com/e7V05o0DJ8    (@exsuzx) December 14, 2017America s most prominent Socialist weighed in on the topic:This is an egregious attack on our democracy.

I am being advised by security that we are going to have to take a break,  Pai calmly told the audience. Soon after, a security guard could be heard loudly advising everyone in the room   both the Commissioners and the public visitors   to exit and leave their belongings in the federal agency chambers.Foundation that there was a specific bomb threat. Another senior official in the room said someone called into the office and said a briefcase was set to explode.The Commissioners and the audience were eventually allowed back in after Federal Protective Services surveilled the area and situation.A bomb threat occurring right during the middle of Pai s testimony is not surprising as public intrigue around the issue of net neutrality has become so intense that many incensed people have resorted to vile, racist actions.  Daily CallerIs This The New  Normal  For The Left When They Don t Get Their Way?Repeal supporters claimed the rules unnecessarily regulated the industry and impeded upon the free market.Under the rules rescinded Thursday, internet service providers were prohibited from influencing loading speeds for specific websites or apps. The vote rolled back the policies that treated the internet like a utility and could potentially lead to the creation of different lanes of speeds for websites or content creators willing to pay for them. Critics worry that those costs could be passed along to consumers.Internet service providers will have to disclose whether they engage in certain types of conduct, such as blocking and prioritization, following Thursday s decision. They must further explicitly publicize what is throttled and what is blocked, with the information posted on an easily accessible website hosted by the company or the FCC.Repeal is a hallmark victory for the FCC s Republican chairman Ajit Pai whose 11-month tenure has seen him strongly advocate for reduced regulation. Pai was named FCC chairman in January by President Donald Trump, who has made no secret of his interest in reigning in Obama-era business regulations.In July 2017, net neutrality supporters organized a  Day of Action  in support of net neutrality regulations; large tech companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon all showcased their support for the regulations.Net neutrality is the notion that Internet Service Providers (ISPs) shouldn t be able to  slow down, speed up, or block data as it is routed from its content originator to end users  in order to favor particular sites. The net neutrality regulations put in place under the Obama administration involved subjecting the Internet to Title II of the 1934 Communications Act, where it s considered a public utility that is subject to the iron grip of the FCC.The FCC is now trying to kill these regulations, and they are right do so. Here are seven reasons why.1. The instances of ISPs slowing down or blocking data to favor certain sites over others are few and far between.2. Under Title II, the Internet is subject to a bevy of regulations at the whim of the FCC.3. The FCC can also subject ISPs to a slew of taxes under Title II.4. The FCC also has the power to prevent ISPs from charging websites at rates they deem to be unfair and ends  paid priority. 5. It s a form of censorship.6. It s crony capitalism in favor of web giants like Facebook and Google. That s why they support net neutrality, since it targets their competitors.7. The better way to ensure net neutrality is to breathe more capitalism into the ISP market rather than government control.",politics,"Dec 14, 2017"
"JUST IN: Documents Reveal Hillary Clinton Struck a Deal to Keep Records Private","Here s yet another reason to be very suspicious of the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton:Via Free Beacon: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton struck a deal with the State Department while serving in the Obama administration that allowed her to take ownership of records she did not want made public, according to recently released reports.Clinton and her then-deputy chief of staff Huma Abedin were permitted to remove electronic and physical records under a claim they were  personal  materials and  unclassified, non-record materials. Judicial Watch made the revelation after filing a FOIA request with the State Department and obtaining a record of the agreement:The newly released documents show the deal allowed Clinton and Abedin to remove documents related to particular calls and schedules, and the records would not be  released to the general public under FOIA.  Abedin, for instance, was allowed to remove electronic records and five boxes of physical files, including files labeled  Muslim Engagement Documents. The released records included a list of designated materials that  would not be released to the general public under FOIA  and were to be released  to the Secretary with this understanding. Electronic copy of  daily files    which are word versions of public documents and non-records: speeches/press statements/photos from the website, a non-record copy of the schedule, a non record copy of the call log, press clips, and agenda of daily activitiesElectronic copy of a log of calls the Secretary made since 2004, it is a non-record, since her official calls are logged elsewhere (official schedule and official call log)Electronic copy of the Secretary s  call grid  which is a running list of calls she wants to make (both personal and official)16 boxes: Personal Schedules (1993 thru 2008-prior to the Secretary s tenure at the Department of State.29 boxes: Miscellaneous Public Schedules during her tenure as FLOTUS and Senator-prior to the Secretary s tenure at the Department of State1 box: Personal Reimbursable receipts (6/25/2009 thru 1/14/2013)1 box: Personal Photos1 box: Personal schedule (2009-2013) STICKY FINGERS  CLINTON:A physical file of  the log of the Secretary s gifts with pictures of gifts  was also handed over to Clinton.

John Katko over the net neutrality debate, the latest in a string of threats from advocates of the liberal policy.Federal Communications Commission chairman Ajit Pai has received numerous threats since announcing the agency s intention earlier this year to repeal the Obama era rules that expanded federal regulation over the internet.Katko, a Republican who represents upstate New York and has no role in the FCC agenda, received a threatening voicemail from Patrick Angelo, who vowed to kill Katko s family if he supports repealing net neutrality. Listen Mr. Katko, if you support net neutrality, I will support you,  Angelo said, according to a complaint filed in federal court.  But if you don t support net neutrality, I will find you and your family and I will kill  you  all. Do you understand? I will literally find all  of  you and your progeny and just wipe you from the face of the earth. Angelo was charged with threatening to kill a U.S. congressman and is facing up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine. I condemn in the strongest possible terms any attempts to intimidate government officials with violent threats, and in particular, efforts to target their families,  said Chairman Pai.

The official reports indicated that Ashe died of a heart attack.The problem, however, is that police on the scene reported Ashe died when his throat was crushed during a work-out accident.Adding to the mysterious nature of Ashe s death was the fact that he had been slated to be in court Monday with his Chinese businessman co-defendant Ng Lap Seng, from whom he reportedly received over $1 billion in donations during his term as president of the U.N. General Assembly. And then there was this: During the presidency of Bill Clinton, Seng illegally funneled several hundred thousand dollars to the Democrat National Committee.Now ABC News is reporting:An acclaimed trauma surgeon was found dead with a knife in his torso Sunday in his Park Avenue apartment in a suspected suicide, New York City police said.Dr. Dean Lorich, 54, was the associate director of the orthopedic trauma service at the Hospital for Special Surgery who treated Bono in 2014 after the U2 frontman was badly injured in a cycling accident in Central Park.Lorich was also a professor at Weill Cornell Medical College.His death is being investigated as an apparent suicide, a New York Police Department official told ABC News.Initial investigations did not find any signs of forced entry at his apartment, the official said. Authorities have not found a suicide note.Police responding to a 911 call of an assault in a Park Avenue apartment at 1:05 p.m. Sunday found Lorich unconscious and unresponsive with a knife in his torso, according to the NYPD. Emergency medical service responders pronounced him dead.The email Wikileaks published, was highly critical of the failed relief efforts in Haiti and was shared by Cheryl Mills with Hillary Clinton.In 2010, Lorich was part of a relief effort that flew to Haiti as a volunteer to offer his skills for civilians who had been injured during the earthquakes that devastated the region.Within 24 hours of the earthquake, a 13-member team of surgeons, anesthesiologists, and operating room nurses was assembled, with a massive amount of orthopedic operating room equipment, and flew to Port-au-Prince with Dr. Lorich.Bill and Hillary Clinton s  charitable  Clinton foundation led the relief effort in Haiti raising millions of dollars from around the world to help the people recover from the natural disaster. Sadly, most of the funds never reached the people of Haiti, but instead, lined the pockets of the Clintons  associates who were meant to redevelop the nation, but never delivered.Dr. Lorich and his team were there to help save the limbs of those injured, which without the proper medical treatment, would have meant amputation for a lot of people.Lorich described amputation in those conditions as a  death sentence  and hoped to treat as many sufferers as possible, saying:  We expected many amputations.  But we thought we could save limbs that were salvageable, particularly those of children.  We recognized that in an underdeveloped country, a limb amputation may be a death sentence.  It does not have to be so. With the amount of money that was being donated to Haiti for the victims, Lorich and his team expected to have full support when their plane touched down.Instead, he described the situation as  shameful  and witnessed, first hand, a huge misappropriation of funds, with the people affected by the disaster receiving no help whatsoever.Dr. Lorich was disgusted by what he saw and sent an email to then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s Chief of Staff Cheryl D. Mills to report what he had seen.In July 2017, a 50-year-old Haitian tied to the Clinton Foundation was found dead with a gunshot wound to his head.It s no secret that the Clinton Foundation has been facing credible reports of robbing impoverished Haitians who were devastated by Hurricane Hanna in 2008, through their  foundation.  Haitians have been protesting for years outside of the Clinton Foundation offices over the theft of money that was donated by individuals and businesses to the Clinton Foundation that never made it to the poorest of the poor.One man was set to testify against the Clinton Foundation next week. That man was 50-year-old former Haitian government official Klaus Eberwein. He was found dead in his Miami home with a  gunshot to the head  that s been ruled a  suicide  by the Miami-Dade s medical examiner records supervisor. (Think Vince Foster)Klaus Eberwein, a former Haitian government official who was expected to expose the extent of Clinton Foundation corruption and malpractice next week, has been found dead in Miami. He was 50.Eberwein was due to appear next Tuesday before the Haitian Senate Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission where he was widely expected to testify that the Clinton Foundation misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from international donors.Eberwein, who had acknowledged his life was in danger, was a fierce critic of the Clinton Foundation s activities in the Caribbean island, where he served as director general of the government s economic development agency, Fonds d assistance  conomique et social, for three years.According to Eberwein, a paltry 0.6% of donations granted by international donors to the Clinton Foundation with the express purpose of directly assisting Haitians actually ended up in the hands of Haitian organizations. A further 9.6% ended up with the Haitian government. The remaining 89.8%   or $5.4 billion   was funneled to non-Haitian organizations. The Clinton Foundation, they are criminals, they are thieves, they are liars, they are a disgrace,  Eberwein said at a protest outside the Clinton Foundation headquarters in Manhattan last year.The former director general of Haiti, who also served as an advisor to Haitian President Michel Martelly, was also a partner in a popular pizza restaurant in Haiti, Muncheez, and even has a pizza   the Klaus Special   named after him.According to the Haiti Libre newspaper, Eberwein was said to be in  good spirits , with plans for the future. His close friends and business partners are shocked by the idea he may have committed suicide. It s really shocking,  said Muncheez s owner Gilbert Bailly.  We grew up together; he was like family.   Your News WireAmericans were warned about the crooked dealings of the Clinton Crime family when in September of 2016, former Senate President of Haiti, Bernard Sansaricq, shocked a large crowd at a Trump campaign event in Little Haiti, FL. Sansaricq stood up during the public event and relayed his account of the Clinton s dirty dealings in Haiti while he was still in office. To his credit, candidate Donald Trump allowed Sansaricq to speak his mind, and to expose the crimes of the Clinton s, who were attempting to scratch and claw their way back into our White House.Sansaricq claimed he begged the Clinton Administration not to invade Haiti. His request was followed up with a visit by an anonymous messenger from the White House who encouraged him to  side  with the Clinton Administration and he would  be the richest man in Haiti. He also demanded that Hillary Clinton  disclose the audit of all money  related to the Haiti earthquake crisis, as he claimed they scammed the poorest citizens of Haiti out of BILLIONS of dollars through the Clinton Foundation. Not even 2% of that money went back to Haiti. So, Mr. Trump, we are asking you, begging you, the Haitian community will side with you if one day, you ask Hillary Clinton publicly to disclose the audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti in 2010 after the earthquake. Haiti is a very poor country. Haiti needs defenders. You said you would champion our cause. We welcome you sir and we will work with you. Ask Hillary Clinton publicly, during your next debate for an audit of all of the money they have stolen from Haiti. Only a couple of days before Eberwein s death, a Republican donor, and operative from Chicago s North Shore who said he had tried to obtain Hillary Clinton s missing emails from Russian hackers killed himself in a Minnesota hotel room days after talking to The Wall Street Journal about his efforts, public records show.In a room at a Rochester hotel used almost exclusively by Mayo Clinic patients and relatives, Peter W. Smith, 81, left a carefully prepared file of documents, which includes a statement police called a suicide note in which he said he was in ill health and a life insurance policy was expiring.",politics,"Dec 13, 2017"
"WATCH: INTERNATIONAL SHOPLIFTING PUNK LiAngelo Ball Makes Disgusting Admission About His Apology To President Trump&Proves Hes No Better Than His Ungrateful Dad","It s beyond sad to watch these young men sitting through an interview with their overbearing, loudmouth dad controlling their every move. It s especially disturbing to see Lavar Ball and the hosts of The Breakfast Club laughing about LiAngelo and his fellow UCLA basketball players stealing Louis Vuitton sunglasses in China.He certainly isn t doing them any favors LiAngelo Ball said he wouldn t have apologized to President Trump if UCLA didn t make him do so.After Ball and teammates Cody Riley and Jalen Hill were arrested and released for shoplifting in China, the trio held a press conference after arriving in the United States where they thanked Trump for his role in their release. But according to LiAngelo, who along with his dad, LaVar, spoke about the apology with The Breakfast Club Wednesday morning, an apology wouldn t have been in the cards if he knew he wasn t going to play for UCLA again.Watch, as Lavar Ball, the father of 2 of these 3 unfortunate young men that were part of the interview with The Breakfast Club, talks about how differently he d be treated if he were white. Perhaps someone should explain to Lavar that the real reason he offends everyone within earshot of his big mouth, is because he s an arrogant ass, who owes any attention he gets from the media to his son s athletic abilities (which of course, he takes full credit for). They wanted to hear that, and he tweeted about it before my speech so I had to add it in there right before I gave it,  LiAngelo told the Power 105.1 morning show.According to the middle Ball son, the school reminded him about Trump right before he went up to speak to the press. If they didn t tell me to do it, it wouldn t have been in there,  Ball said on the program, in reference to the Trump apology.Trump fired off a tweet after the UCLA players returned questioning whether they would thank him for facilitating their release.Trump s tweet then prompted LaVar Ball to question how exactly Trump helped. Who?  Ball told ESPN.  What was he over there for? Don t tell me nothing. Everybody wants to make it seem like he helped me out. Ball s response led to more beef between the two, with Ball reigniting the feud earlier in December when he tweeted a cartoon showing him dunking on the commander-in-chief.LiAngelo, who was suspended indefinitely by UCLA, left the school weeks later and, along with his younger brother, LaMelo, signed a professional contract with Lithuania basketball club Prienu Vytautas this week.  NYPOn November 21, 2017, we published an article about how a family member revealed the SICK reason LaVar Ball allegedly wouldn t let his sons see their mother after  surgery to remove portion of her skull So who is this crackpot LaVar Ball, and why would anyone in their right mind make such arrogant and ignorant remarks after the President of the United States just helped their son to escape a prison sentence in a foreign country? Andrew Stephens of the Armchair All Americans did a pretty good job of summing up what a horrible human being the self-serving, money, and fame-obsessed LaVar Ball really is. In his article, Stephens reveals a sick man, who is so controlling of his 3 sons and their basketball careers, that he wouldn t even let them visit their very sick mother in the hospital, over fears that it could create media attention that could damage his merchandise brand.On March 15, 2017, Andrew Stephens of Armchair All Americans published an article about Lavar Ball titled Lavar Ball: The epitome of what is wrong with modern sports. It touched on helicopter parenting and the monetization of potentially profitable children.Stephens claimed that in the article, without commenting on upbringing tactics, I attempted to delve into Lavar Ball s seemingly unnecessary promotion of his own sons for his personal benefit.About an hour after the article was run, I received a comment on it from a member of the Ball family, who wishes to remain anonymous. The comment (which has since been removed to protect the email address and identity of the commenter) read as follows:- Wow. You nailed it. Although you don t even know the half of it. Lavar took over the high school program, added the Coach, his puppet (which is why he quit last year after becoming the national coach of the year) and Lavar stepped on and crushed countless other kids  careers and love for the game to get his kids on the court. If you are allowed to shoot at any time from anywhere and never come out of the game, any decent idiot could score 30 points.Also, Tina Ball, his wife had a stroke on Feb 21. She had life-threatening skull surgery to relieve brain pressure   guess where Lavar was during the operation that could have killed his wife?   at the CHHS vs. LB Poly game with his sons, including Lonzo. He still has not allowed his kids to see their sick mother due to the media attention it would bring to him, and cause BBB sales to diminish. [Name of hospital] in [City of hospital], CA   Tina is there now and he only visits for 1 hour a few days a week, while her Mother has yet to leave her side. Pathetic!!! ",politics,"Dec 13, 2017"

"LYNCH MOB WINS By Less Than 1%&Why Republicans Are To Blame For LEFTIST DOUG JONES Victory","They threw everything but the kitchen sink at Judge Roy Moore. Democrats outspent Moore 10-1, and more importantly, the Democrat Party unified, like they always do, to get behind their candidate (think Hillary Clinton), no matter their flaws, or how weak of a candidate he or she may be. Meanwhile, the Republicans did exactly what they always do they splintered, they argued amongst themselves, and they waited until the 11th hour to get behind Roy Moore, the Republican candidate who was accused (without evidence) by several women (one of whom admitted to committing forgery in a high school yearbook used as evidence of her claim against him) of sexual misconduct several decades ago. The media will try to blame this loss on President Trump, but the truth of the matter is, that the Republican Party came late to the game with funding and with support for Roy Moore, while half of the party either sat on their hands or openly condemned their candidate. The spineless Republican Party can take credit for the historic loss tonight in Alabama.AP   In a stunning victory aided by scandal, Democrat Doug Jones won Alabama s special Senate election on Tuesday, beating back history, an embattled Republican opponent and President Donald Trump, who urgently endorsed GOP rebel Roy Moore despite a litany of sexual misconduct allegations.It was the first Democratic Senate victory in a quarter-century in Alabama, one of the reddest of red states, and proved anew that party loyalty is anything but sure in the age of Trump. It was a major embarrassment for the president and a fresh wound for the nation s already divided Republican Party.A number of Republicans declined to support him, including Alabama s long-serving Sen. Richard Shelby. But Trump lent his name and the national GOP s resources to Moore s campaign in recent days.",politics,"Dec 12, 2017"

"SENATOR GILLIBRAND Pulled Strings So Muslim Athlete Who Molested 12-Year Old Girl Could Come To U.S. After His Visa Was Denied","Democrat Senator Kristen Gillibrand (NY) likes to think of herself as a champion of women. After multiple women came forward to accuse fellow Democrat Senator Al Franken of sexual assault (photos were also supplied as evidence of one of the accuser s claims), Gillibrand finally called for Franken to step down. Was Gillibrand s call for her fellow Senator to step down part of a larger plan to appear neutral, as she then attacked President Donald Trump for unfounded allegations against him only months before the election?  Isn t it kind of hypocritical for Gillibrand to call anyone out of sexual misconduct after she fought to bring a Muslim athlete to upstate New York who molested an innocent 12-year old girl while he was in America?The media CHEERED when NY Democrat Senator s Kirsten Gillibrand and Chuck Schumer helped a 24-yr old Muslim man enter the U.S. after he was denied entry The media was strangely SILENT, however, after he molested a 12-yr-old upstate NY girl while she was with her family at an event celebrating the Muslim athlete. Yesterday, it was discovered that the Islamic extremist who killed 9 people and injured dozens of others, when he rammed his truck into them on a busy bike path in New York City, entered our country on a  Diversity visa  that was the brainchild of none other than the Democrat Senator from NY, Chuck (I always put diversity before our nation s security) Schumer An Indian athlete who overcame a visa denial with the help of U.S. lawmakers and a local mayor to attend the World Snowshoe Championship in New York has been arrested on charges of the abuse of a minor.It was a long journey for Indian snowshoe champion Hussain and his coach to the World Snowshoe Championships in Saranac Lake, New York last weekend.The US embassy in New Delhi rejected Tanveer Hussain s application for a visa so he could compete in the World Snowshoe Championship last month, Fox News reported.Local officials then appealed for help to Schumer and Gillibrand, and their offices reached out to the New Delhi embassy, which let Hussain successfully reapply for a visa.Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer, an outspoken opponent of President Trump s position on stricter immigration policies for immigrants and visa holders coming into the United States, bragged about getting around Trump s temporary travel restrictions to bring convicted pedophile Tanveer Hussain to New York on his Facebook page:Schumer s office told Fox he often intervenes to help international competitions. As we often do when local communities ask for help, at the request of Saranac Lake we helped to navigate the visa process so these athletes could compete at a local competition. The charges against one member of the group, who is accused of a serious crime and abusing our visa program, are extremely troubling. If he s found guilty, he should be punished to the fullest extent of the law,  a rep said.Gillibrand s office offered a similar response, adding that the charges are  extremely serious. Hussain hails from the Indian side of the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, which is predominantly Muslim. Although India is not one of the seven countries that were part of the initial travel ban, Hussain and Khan had alleged they were victims of it when their first attempt at procuring visas to travel to the United States was turned down in late January, the first business day after Trump s travel ban was put in place.Khan told the BBC that an employee at the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi told them they were being rejected because of  current policy. U.S. officials said at the time that the denial was not connected to the travel ban. An embassy spokesman said they were preparing a statement for release later in the day.

Taneer is pictured in center-left with his arms around a young girl.The grand jury returned the indictment charging Tanveer Hussain with one count of first-degree sexual abuse and two counts of endangering the welfare of a child, a report in the Adirondack Daily Enterprise quoted a press release from Essex County District Attorney Kristy Sprague as saying.The reckless and irresponsible acts of Democrat legislators like Senator Chuck Schumer, perfectly illustrates why Trump was right about demanding that we put additional vetting measures in place for immigrants.Hussain and team manager Abid Khan arrived Feb. 23 in the bucolic Adirondacks town, which had been following their visa ordeal and extended them a hero s welcome. Locals offered congratulations and free lodgings at an inn that in the snow looked like a  fairy tale scene from a movie,  Khan said in a Facebook post.The  fairy tale  was shattered Wednesday, when Hussain, 24, was arrested and charged with felony sexual abuse and child welfare endangerment, police said.The parents of the 12-year-old girl allegedly involved said the incident happened Monday, after the end of the three-day snowshoe competition, and reported it to local authorities.Chief Charles A. Potthast Jr. of the Saranac Lake Village police force said the girl was playing pool Monday afternoon with other young people at the inn where Hussain was staying. There was a moment when the two were alone, and that s when the incident occurred,  Potthast said. The girl told police there was a  passionate kiss  and that Hussain touched her in an intimate area on top of her clothing.During their time in Saranac Lake, Hussein and his coach were honored with a special reception by the mayor and gave a talk about Kashmir at Saranac Lake Middle School, where students had waged a letter-writing campaign on their behalf.

It s curious that the reporter never asked McCain about his efforts to smear our president with a unsubstantiated dirty dossier from an ex-spy:In August 2016,  Steele came to me to tell me what was in it, and why it   was important,  Wood said.  He made it very clear   yes, it was raw intelligence, but it needed putting into proper context before you could judge it fully. August 2016 is a critical period, just after the FBI opened the Russia meddling probe, and after then-director James Comey recommended against prosecution for Clinton s mishandling of classified information.Wood said Steele had  already been in contact with the FBI  at the time. He said there was corroborating evidence in the United States, from which I assumed he was working with an American company,  Wood said.British court records reviewed by Fox News as well as U.S. congressional testimony revealed that Steele was directed and paid at least $168,000 by Fusion GPS founder Glenn Simpson to push the research that fall to five American media outlets. According to British court documents, Steele met with The New York Times (twice), The Washington Post (twice), CNN, The New Yorker and Yahoo News (twice). Each of these interviews was conducted in person and with a member of Fusion also present,  according to the records associated with separate civil litigation against Steele and Fusion GPS.Wood said he d heard of Fusion GPS, as the group Steele was working with, but had  never heard of Mr. Simpson. Three weeks after Trump won the presidential election, at the Canadian security conference, the details were finalized for the dossier hand-off to McCain.Read more: Fox News",politics,"Dec 11, 2017"
"Authorities Allowed NYC Chain Migration Terrorist To Stop Interrogation Several Times To Pray After Admitting He Was Triggered By CHRISTMAS Posters","The poor little ISIS-inspired, chain migration, snowflake, terrorist can t even walk by a Christmas poster without being triggered. How long before Mayor DeBlasio starts the dialogue about removing triggering signs of Christmas from NYC, so as not to offend non-Christians? The taxi driver behind the failed terror attack in a New York City told investigators he meant to detonate his homemade pipe bomb in the busy subway station after seeing the walls festooned with Christmas posters   in revenge for violence against Muslims all over the world.While initial reports suggested the crude pipe bomb, made from a pipe, a 9-volt battery, match heads, sugar, Christmas tree lights and screws, had detonated prematurely, suspect Akayed Ullah, 27, insisted he set off the bomb deliberately.Ullah, who was arrested and taken for questioning after the bomb only partially detonated, told police he was walking through the underground tunnel at 7.20am, between the Port Authority station towards Times Square, when he saw the Christmas-themed posters on the wall, which reminded him of ISIS  calls last month for militants and lone wolves to attack holiday markets.  He acknowledges he purposely set it off then and there,  a senior law enforcement official told the New York Post.The Bangladeshi immigrant added that he was specifically inspired by ISIS,  not Al-Qaeda .Authorities say that if the explosive had fully detonated in the busy Midtown Manhattan subway station, there would have been more injuries and doubtless loss of life.The attack came days after Ullah s Brooklyn neighbors say they heard a huge row coming from his home, reporting yelling and screaming over the past two nights.Ullah, who was allowed to stop and pray multiple times during his interrogation, was taken to Bellevue Hospital to be treated for serious burns and lacerations to his abdomen and hands but is expected to survive. At the hospital, the Brooklyn resident told investigators that he was inspired to carry out the attack by the recent flare ups between Israelis and Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.Monday s attack was the first terror attack on U.S. soil since that proclamation, but only one of many violent demonstrations across the world since the controversial move was announced last Wednesday. It was also the second time in two months that New York City was the target of a terrorist attack.President Trump said in a statement that  lax  immigration policies were to blame for the attack, and urged Congress to  enact legislative reforms to protect the American people .Authorities say Ullah took the A train subway to the Port Authority Bus Terminal stop Monday morning, and started walking east towards Times Square via an underground terminal when a pipe bomb hidden underneath his clothes prematurely exploded. Law enforcement officials don t believe the passageway was the intended target since the  low-tech  bomb   attached to Ullah with Velcro and zip ties   did not explode fully.The chemical explosive appears to have ignited but the pipe itself did not burst. Screws were found at the scene, indicating that they may have filled the pipe and were intended to be used as shrapnel.In the end, Ullah was the only one seriously injured by the explosive (three others reported to hospitals for ringing in the ears and headaches).

"FORMER CIA DIRECTOR Admits Guilt of Intel Agencies Out to Get Trump: I dont think I fully thought through the implications","Remember former CIA Director Mike Morell s lies about Benghazi? He totally covered for Hillary and the Obama administration after Benghazi:Could this be connected to the reason Morell is now coming clean about targeting Trump?WHY IS HE ADMITTING GUILT NOW?Former Acting CIA Director Michael Morell thinks that intelligence agencies were too harsh to Trump during the campaign and presidential transition, according to an interview released Monday.Morell, who left the CIA in 2013 after serving as its acting director twice, endorsed Hillary Clinton in an August 2016 New York Times op-ed.Politico s Susan Glassner asked Morell if getting involved was a mistake and the former CIA official said that it wasn t, but that  there were downsides to it that I didn t think about at the time. I was concerned about what is the impact it would have on the agency, right? Very concerned about that, thought that through. But I don t think I fully thought through the implications,  Morell said. So, let s put ourselves here in Donald Trump s shoes. So, what does he see? Right? He sees a former director of CIA and a former director of NSA, Mike Hayden, who I have the greatest respect for, criticizing him and his policies. Right? And he could rightfully have said,  Huh, what s going on with these intelligence guys?  Right? And then he sees a former acting director and deputy director of CIA criticizing him and endorsing his opponent,  Morell continued.  And then he gets his first intelligence briefing, after becoming the Republican nominee, and within 24 to 48 hours, there are leaks out of that that are critical of him and his then-national security advisor, Mike Flynn. Morell is referring to an NBC report that said Flynn was repeatedly interrupting briefers during the session. And so, this stuff starts to build, right? And he must have said to himself,  What is it with these intelligence guys? Are they political?  The current director at the time, John Brennan, during the campaign occasionally would push back on things that Donald Trump had said,  Morell told Politico.The former CIA acting director continued to reference leaked reports during the interview. Then he becomes president, and he s supposed to be getting a daily brief from the moment he becomes the president-elect. Right? And he doesn t. And within a few days, there s leaks about how he s not taking his briefing. So, he must have thought right? that,  Who are these guys? Are these guys out to get me? Is this a political organization? Can I think about them as a political organization when I become president? He concluded:  So, I think there was a significant downside to those of us who became political in that moment. So, if I could have thought of that, would I have ended up in a different place? I don t know. But it s something I didn t think about. ",politics,"Dec 11, 2017"

They thought it would be a great idea to bring on a doctor who would tell them how horrible it is for Trump to drink lots of Diet Coke. Well, they thought wrong This one backfires on Brooke Baldwin LOL!Near the close of Brooke Baldwin s CNN program Monday afternoon, she invited on a board-certified gastroenterologist to assess the effect on President Donald Trump s health of his massive Diet Coke intake.VISUAL AIDE:The discussion came with a visual aide of a dozen Diet Coke cans, representing the 12 Trump knocks back per day in the White House, according to a recent New York Times report.Dr. Samantha Nazareth noted the diet soda had less calories than regular soda, but drinking 12  essentially replaces what other liquids will provide to your body. You should be drinking water, not this,  she said.Baldwin wondered if drinking that many Diet Cokes could be  super crazy harmful  to the body, but Nazareth said not necessarily. Instead, it might encourage the drinker to engage in more sweets. You need to think of the body in its entirety. What are you drinking? What are you eating?  Nazareth asked.  How much are you sleeping? How much stress are you getting a day? This all affects the body. It s not just 12 cans.

"JUST IN: Pro-ISIS Terrorist Who Intended to Blow Up NYC Bus Terminal During Rush Hour Came To U.S. Through CHAIN MIGRATION Program Democrats Are Fighting For","In September, President Donald Trump tweeted a new condition for a potential deal with Democrats on immigration. Trump warned that he would not budge on allowing the failed  chain migration  program to continue in the United States. CHAIN MIGRATION cannot be allowed to be part of any legislation on Immigration!  he wrote.CHAIN MIGRATION cannot be allowed to be part of any legislation on Immigration!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 15, 2017 Business Insider attempted to paint a softer picture of the harsh realities (like terrorism) that chain migration brings with the unpopular program to the United States.Chain migration is a term almost exclusively used by immigration hardliners when referring to the family-reunification-based component of the US immigration system, through which US citizens or lawful permanent residents may sponsor close family members to join them in the US.Prominent anti-immigration groups like the Federation for American Immigration Reform and NumbersUSA have frequently denounced chain migration, describing it as a process that admits  indefinite  numbers of unskilled immigrants based on family connections alone and that prompts foreigners to view US immigration as a  right or entitlement. Immigration proponents, however, describe family-based immigration as essential in helping new immigrants assimilate into US society. The American Immigration Council argues that newcomers who can bring family members with them when they immigrate to the US have stronger social and economic support that helps them  navigate the system. Trump s tweet about chain migration on Friday could signal a new bump in the road for any immigration deal with Democrats. The bipartisan Dream Act, recently reintroduced in Congress by Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin and Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, includes a pathway to citizenship for the so-called Dreamers, whose protections under the DACA program will be phased out over the next six months.FOX News reports  An attempted suicide bomber who set off a rush-hour explosion at the nation s busiest bus terminal is a Bangladeshi national living in Brooklyn who was inspired by ISIS, law enforcement officials said.The suspect in Monday morning s blast at Port Authority in midtown Manhattan was identified as Akayed Ullah, 27.

"WHY ROY MOORES ELECTION WIN Is Critical For President Trump To Replace Leftist Federal and U.S. Supreme Court Activist Judges","Tomorrow, Alabama residents (including thousands of felons who have been registered by Al Sharpton s alleged brother) will go to the polls to decide who they want to represent them in the US Senate. The Democrats have contributed over $10 million to their leftist, virtually unknown candidate, Doug Jones. So, why are they so eager to take this Senate seat?In June 2017, the Democrats spent an astounding $30 million in Georgia s 6th congressional district, to lose a House seat in a special election. They falsely believed that the only thing they needed for Democrat candidate John Ossoff to win the race, was enough Georgians who hated Donald Trump to come out and vote.Is history repeating itself in Alabama?Democrat Senate candidate Doug Jones raised nearly six times Moore s amount ahead of the Dec. 12 special election to fill the Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Jones headed into the final weeks of the race with roughly four times as much money in the bank than his GOP opponent.Jones raked in nearly $10.2 million compared to Jones  $1.8 million. Jones also spent roughly 5 times as much as Moore during that period, nearly $8.7 million compared to Moore s $1.7 million.Conservative Pat Buchanan asks,  Why would Christian conservatives in good conscience go to the polls Dec. 12 and vote for Judge Roy Moore, despite the charges of sexual misconduct with teenagers leveled against him? Answer: That Alabama Senate race could determine whether Roe v. Wade is overturned. The lives of millions of unborn may be the stakes.There is, however, so much more at stake than the single issue of abortion in this hotly contested Senate race. Democrats are not going to sit back and allow President Trump a pathway to remaking the radical leftist judicial system they ve worked so hard to put in place. Today, the GOP, holding Congress and the White House, has a narrow path to capture the Third Branch, the Supreme Court, and to dominate the federal courts for a decade. For this historic opportunity, the party can thank two senators, one retired, the other still sitting.The first is former Democratic Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada.In 2013, Harry exercised the  nuclear option,  abolishing the filibuster for President Obama s judicial nominees. The Senate no longer needed 60 votes to confirm judges. Fifty-one Senate votes could cut off debate, and confirm.Iowa s Chuck Grassley warned Harry against stripping the minority of its filibuster power. Such a move may come back to bite you, he told Harry. Grassley is now judiciary committee chairman.And this year a GOP Senate voted to use the nuclear option to shut down a filibuster of Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch, who was then confirmed with 55 votes.Yet the Democratic minority still had one card to play to block President Trump s nominees   the  blue slip courtesy. If a senator from the state where a federal judicial nominee resides asks for a hold on proceedings, by not returning a blue slip, the judiciary committee has traditionally honored that request and not held hearings.Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota used the blue slip to block the Trump nomination of David Stras of Minnesota to the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Franken calls Stras too ideological, too conservative.But Grassley has now decided to reject the blue slip courtesy for appellate court judges, since their jurisdiction is not just over a single state like Minnesota, but over an entire region.Not only are the federal court vacancies almost unprecedented, a GOP Senate and Trump are working in harness to fill them before January 2019, when a new Congress is sworn in.If Republicans blow this opportunity, it is unlikely to come again. For the Supreme Court has seemed within Republican grasp before, only to have it slip away because of presidential errors.Both Trump, by whom he nominates, and a Republican Senate, with its power to confirm with 51 votes, are indispensable if we are to end judicial dictatorship in America.

"THE LIST of 34 House Republicans DEMANDING Permanent AMNESTY For Obamas DACA Kids","Who wants to deport  Dreamers ? Not many people, it turns out. Even veteran immigration restrictionists seem willing to legalize this subset of immigrants in the country illegally if it is part of a package deal. That s true even though a lot of what s said about the DACA recipients is PR-style hooey.For example, it s often said   indeed, former President Barack Obama just recently said   that the approximately 800,000 of them were  brought to this country by their parents.  Well, many were. But that s not required to qualify as a protected Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program recipient under the various plans, including Obama s. You just have to have entered the country illegally before age 16. You could have decided to sneak in against your parents  wishes. You re still a  Dreamer! Likewise, we re told DACA recipients are college-bound high school grads or military personnel. That s an exaggeration. All that s actually required is that the person enroll in a high school course or an  alternative,  including online courses and English-as-a-second-language classes. Under Obama s now-suspended program, you didn t even have to stay enrolled.Compared with the general population, DACA recipients are not especially highly skilled. A recent survey for several pro- Dreamer  groups, with participants recruited by those groups, found that while most DACA recipients are not in school, the vast majority work. But their median hourly wage is only $15.34, meaning that many are competing with hard-pressed lower-skilled Americans.The DACA recipients you read about have typically been carefully selected for their appeal. They re valedictorians. They re first responders. They re curing diseases. They root for the Yankees. They want to serve in the Army. If DACA recipients are the poster children for the much larger population of immigrants in the country illegally, these are the poster children for the poster children.  Chicago Tribune34 Republicans in Congress are not about to let the pesky facts about Obama s  Dreamers  get in the way of lobbying Speaker Ryan to grant them permanent citizenship.Numbers USA reports  Thirty-four Republicans in the House of Representatives signed a letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan calling for passage of a permanent DACA amnesty before the end of the year. Reps. Scott Taylor (R-Va.) and Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.) led the effort.While the lawmakers stop short of demanding passage of a DACA amnesty before the end of the year or including an amnesty in this month s must-pass spending bill, they don t insist on any other immigration-related provisions that would stop future flows of illegal immigration by calling for mandatory E-Verify or to reduce the numerical impact of the amnesty by calling for an end to Chain Migration.The letter reads:Dear Speaker Ryan,We write in support of passing of a permanent legislative solution for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients before the end of the year. DACA recipients   young people brought to America through no fault of their own   are contributing members of our communities and our economy. For many, this is the only country they have ever known. They are American in every way except their immigration status.Since DACA s inception, the federal government has approved approximately 795,000 initial DACA applications and 924,000 renewals. Since being approved for DACA status, an overwhelming majority of these individuals have enrolled in school, found employment, or have served in the military. Studies have shown that passing legislation to permanently protect these individuals would add hundreds of billions to our country s gross domestic product (GDP). That is why the business community, universities, and civic leaders alike support a permanent legislative solution.We agree with President Trump that executive action was not the appropriate process for solving this issue, as was done under the previous administration, and we believe Congress should act. We are compelled to act immediately because many DACA recipients are about to lose or have already lost their permits in the wake of the program s rescission. Not acting is creating understandable uncertainty and anxiety amongst immigrant communities.While we firmly believe Congress must work to address other issues within our broken immigration system, it is imperative that Republicans and Democrats come together to solve this problem now and not wait until next year. We all agree that our border must be enforced, our national security defended, and our broken immigration system reformed, but in this moment, we must address the urgent matter before us in a balanced approach that does not harm valuable sectors of our economy nor the lives of these hard-working young people. We must pass legislation that protects DACA recipients from deportation and gives them the opportunity to apply for a more secured status in our country as soon as possible. Reaching across the aisle to protect DACA recipients before the holidays is the right thing to do.Here s the list of 34 Republicans who need to be drained from the swamp:Rep. Scott Taylor (VA-2) Rep.

At the very least, our children should know that they are safe in the classroom, on the playground, and in the cafeteria, where they attend school.  Students who are being bullied in school should know that they will be protected by teachers and staff who should be paying attention to the children who need them most.  Where was the lunch staff when this young boy was being humiliated and bullied by classmates? Fat. Gay. Or just different from the crowd. These are the reasons children are being bullied   sometimes to death   in America s schools, with at least 14 students committing suicide in the past year alone. ABCKnox News  The anti-bullying video of a Union County middle schooler went viral over the weekend, garnering the attention of the Tennessee Titans and the University of Tennessee Vols football teams.Kimberly Jones posted the video of her son, Keaton, on her Facebook page Friday shortly after 12:30 p.m. She said she had just picked Keaton up from school because he was too afraid to go to lunch as a result of bullying. For the record, Keaton asked to do this AFTER he had me pick him up AGAIN because he was afraid to go to lunch,  Jones wrote in her Facebook post. My kids are by no stretch perfect, and at home, he s as all boy as they come, but by all accounts, he s good at school. Talk to your kids.

"OUCH! President Trump Takes Off The Gloves&BLASTS Democrats For Using AMNESTY For Illegals As Bargaining Chip For Funding Government: Help me, Dad! Those were the last words spoken by Kate Steinle, as she lay dying on a San Francisco Pier [VIDEO]","When candidate-Trump promised he would put America first, he wasn t kidding. President Trump posted a powerful video on Twitter tonight, blasting Democrats for putting their desire to give illegal aliens amnesty before the safety and security of American citizens, as they demand amnesty as a condition for funding the government.Here is the transcript of President Trump s powerful speech that he posted on Twitter only minutes ago: Help me, Dad!  Those were the last words spoken by Kate Steinle, as she lay dying on a San Francisco Pier. A precious young American woman, killed in the prime of her life. Kate s death is a tragedy that was entirely preventable. She was shot by an illegal alien, and a 7-time convicted felon, who had been deported 5 times, but he was free to harm an innocent American, because our leaders refuse to protect our border, and because San Francisco is a sanctuary city.In sanctuary states and cities, innocent Americans are at the mercy of criminal aliens because state and local officials defy federal authority and obstruct the enforcement of our immigration laws. Last week, in a final injustice, Kate s killer was acquitted of all of most serious charges, yet one more reason why Americans are so upset by sanctuary cities and open-border politicians who shield criminal aliens from federal law enforcement and all of the problems involved with the whole concept of a sanctuary city. They re no good!We mourn for all of the American families of all backgrounds, who will have any empty seat at Christmas this year because our immigration laws were not enforced. No American should be separated from their loved ones because of preventable crime committed by those illegally in our country. Our cities should be sanctuaries for Americans, not for criminal illegals.  Unfortunately, Democrats in Congress not only oppose our efforts to stop illegal immigration, and crack down on sanctuary cities,  now they are demanding amnesty as a condition for funding the government, holding troop funding hostage, and putting our national security at risk. We cannot allow it. Every Senator and Congressman will have to make a choice, do they want to protect American citizens, or do they want to protect criminal aliens? Reasonable people can disagree on many things, but there can be no disagreement that the first duty of government is to serve, protect and defend American citizens. People can have different views on the technical details of budget policy or transportation, but no one who serves in office should disagree that our highest priority must be the safety and well-being of our nation s citizens. Thank you. Watch:No American should be separated from their loved ones because of preventable crime committed by those illegally in our country.

"JAMES WOODS Has Social Media In Tears After Tweeting HILARIOUS Videos Of Two of The Most Ignorant Liberals In America [VIDEOS]","Conservative Hollywood actor, James Woods, is known for his brilliant wit and his great sense of humor on Twitter, but today he really outdid himself when he posted two hilarious videos on Twitter, proving, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that liberalism really is truly a mental disorder. His first video was a retweet of Democrat Rep. Hank Johnson, who, in 2010 actually questioned Admiral Robert Willard, commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, about a proposal to move 8,000 Marines from the Japanese island of Okinawa to the U.S. Pacific island territory of Guam. Johnson expressed his concern over moving too many US troops to the very small island of Guam because too many people on the island may cause it to  tip over and capsize .Here is the transcript of the unbelievable exchange between Democrat Rep. Hank Johnson and Admiral Rober Willard:Johnson: This is a[n] island that at its widest level is what   twelve miles from shore to shore? And at its smallest level   uh, smallest location   it s seven miles between one shore and the other? Is that correct?Willard: I don t have the exact dimensions, but to your point, sir, I think Guam is a small island.Johnson: Very small island, about twenty-four miles, if I recall, long, twenty-four miles long, about seven miles wide at the least widest place on the island and about twelve miles wide on the widest part of the island, and I don t know how many square miles that is. Do you happen to know?Willard: I don t have that figure with me, sir, I can certainly supply it to you if you like.Johnson: Yeah, my fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize.Willard: We don t anticipate that   the Guam population I think currently about 175,000 and again with 8,000 Marines and their families, it s an addition of about 25,000 more into the population.How the Admiral was able to keep a straight face during this question and answer session is beyond our comprehension.

James Woods didn t waste any time reminding Twitter users about the disgusting video of Chelsea Handler, where she s swimming in the water while actor and comedian Jason Biggs is standing above her on a boat, peeing all over her face. Handler seems unfazed by Biggs peeing on her face, as she looks around smiling, and acting like a human urinal.Woods tweeted about Handler: This person berates the character of @SarahHuckabee on a daily basis. #ChelseaHandlerHumanUrinalThis person berates the character of @SarahHuckabee on a daily basis. #ChelseaHandlerHumanUrinal https://t.co/Y07Q0Rmcw6  James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) December 9, 2017Only 3 days ago, Handler doubled down on stupid, when she tweeted about having to  evacuate  her California home due to the wildfires.

"GERMANY: Afghan Teen Refugee Who RAPED and KILLED Female Med Student and Refugee Volunteer Is Actually 33-Years Old&And Theres MORE!","On September 5, 2017, the Daily Mail reported:Afghan asylum seeker accused of raping and murdering EU official s teenage daughter  attacked her to satisfy his sexual urges before leaving her unconscious in a river to drown Hussein Khavari, 22, who claims to be from Afghanistan has been accused of ambushing Maria Ladenburger, 19, as she cycled home after a party, raping her and then drowning her in Freiburg, Germany last October.He was linked through his DNA to medical student Maria, who volunteered at various shelters that house migrants in her spare time in Freiburg.Hussein claimed to be Afghani but the court heard that there is evidence he is Iraqi. And his claim to be 17 at the time of the offense was disputed by a specialist saying he was at least 22. According to Bild newspaper, during a morning session of hearings in which press and public were excluded, he claimed to be 19.He said he claimed to be 16 upon his arrival in Germany in 2015  because the situation is better here for underage migrants.  The court must decide if he is to be tried as a juvenile or an adult.A murder conviction as a juvenile would mean a maximum ten-year jail term, as an adult a possible life sentence.As it turns out, the fake  teenager  who admitted to raping and murdering the actual teenager, is pretty far removed from his teenage years. According to the Voice of Europe,  the Afghan refugee, who is now on trial for the rape and murder of the medical student Maria Ladenburger in October 2016, is older than previously thought.Hussein Khavari entered Germany in November 2015 without identity papers. He told authorities that he was born in 1999 in Afghanistan and that his father was killed during the war.But it now appears that his father is still alive. According to German media source, Bil.de, his father said his son was born in 1984 and that he is 33-years-old.The Local Germany says about it:  Prosecutors were able to track down Hussein K. s father when they came across a contact on his mobile phone. The defendant told them that they could contact his mother on the number. But when an interpreter called the number in the presence of two judges, the person who picked up was his father .Maria Ladenburger s father is a senior legal adviser to the European Commission in Brussels. Maria herself was volunteering as a refugee worker in various shelters and asylum homes. ",politics,"Dec 9, 2017"
"NEVER-TRUMP BUSTED! Former Jeb Bush Staffer ADMITS To Planting Roy Moore Story In Washington Post","Just another member of the swamp who s about to be sucked down the drain In 2015, leftist rag Politico called it a  Big hire  when Jeb Bush landed Tim Miller as his top communications aide.Jeb Bush plans to name Tim Miller, executive director of America Rising PAC, as his top communications aide, Republican sources told POLITICO on Friday.Miller initially will be a senior adviser to Bush s Right to Rise PAC, and is expected to become communications director if Bush launches his campaign. Kristy Campbell, who has been the PAC s chief spokesperson, likely will be national press secretary of the campaign, or have some senior communications adviser role.Now, thanks to Big League Politics, every member of the GOP can see the type of traitors to the Republican Party Jeb Bush hired to work on his campaign.A Friday Big League Politics report claims Tim Miller, a Republican operative prominent in the  Never Trump  movement, helped pitch the Washington Post story in which the first allegations of sexual misconduct nearly 40 years ago were made against Alabama GOP senatorial nominee Roy Moore.The report contains screenshots of what are alleged to be text messages between Miller and conservative publisher Charles C. Johnson of GotNews.com. The texts show Miller insulting Judge Moore s fitness for office and bragging about how  Beth  is  good to work with.  He is implied to be referring to Beth Reinhard, one of the two authors of the original Washington Post story.Reinhard, before joining the Washington Post, worked at the Wall Street Journal during the 2016 GOP presidential primaries as the embedded reporter covering the Bush campaign. She, therefore, likely had regular interaction with Miller since at least 2015.Miller, who served as Jeb Bush s communications director in the 2016 GOP presidential primaries, categorically denies any involvement in the Washington Post story. He told Breitbart News:I had no involvement in pitching the Washington Post story or any others where women spoke out about Judge Moore. Moore allies have tried to pitch this to 10+ outlets, conservative and mainstream, who have all rejected the story after examining the facts because there is no truth to it.Big League Politics Editor-in-Chief Patrick Howley makes his case as follows:These text messages reveal a few things: the Republican Establishment s relationship with the Post s anti-Moore coverage, the cunning of writer Charles Johnson in trapping Miller, and former Bush staffer Miller s cluelessness about how to conduct himself in the world of political subterfuge. Miller denied to BLP that he was involved in the Washington Post story  or any others where women spoke out about Judge Moore,  but the text messages below leave no doubt as to his involvement [sic][.]During and after the 2016 primaries, Miller was one of the leading voices against eventual GOP nominee Donald Trump. He played a role in the decidedly unsuccessful attempt by Never Trumpers to disregard the will of Republican voters and deny Trump the nomination through the use of convention rules.Miller remains an outspoken critic of Trump and consistently opposes Republicans of the pro-Trump or populist-nationalist bent. He has frequently appeared on cable news programs as an anti-trump Republican voice and now is one of far-left Salon.com s 25 favorite  conservatives. Miller has aggressively campaigned for Judge Moore s liberal Democratic opponent Doug Jones. on Twitter, announcing last month that he had donated money to Jones:I just donated to a Democrat for the first time in my life if any of yall want to do so as well.

"OOPS! Lindsey Vonn Gets Hit With Big Dose Of Karma After Trash-Talking President Trump On CNN","Only 3 days ago, Lindsey Vonn told CNN that she wouldn t be representing President Trump in the 2018 Olympics. She also boldly proclaimed that she wouldn t visit the White House if she were invited. I take the Olympics very seriously and what they mean and what they represent, what walking under our flag means in the opening ceremonies. I want to represent our country well, and I don t think there are a lot of people currently in our government that do that. Is it really appropriate for an Olympic athlete representing the United States of America to make her performance in the Olympics about her hate for Donald Trump?Was it really necessary for Vonn to spew her hate on a network that is not only being called into question for their inaccurate (fake news) reporting on a regular basis but is also known for their extremely unfair coverage of our President?Well, after her miserable showing in Switzerland yesterday,  it looks like Lindsey needs to focus a little more on her skiing technique, and a little less on her anti- Trump rhetoric.According to the AP  Lindsey Vonn finished a World Cup super-G in extreme pain Saturday and was treated by race doctors for a back injury.The American star crossed the finish line in obvious distress, in 24th place and 1.56 seconds behind the winner, and slumped to the snow.She compressed her back on the fifth gate, according to U.S. Ski & Snowboard.Vonn stayed in the finish house to be treated, and one hour later limped slowly into a waiting car to be driven from the St. Moritz course.Minutes earlier, her father Alan Kildow told The Associated Press his daughter was  OK. In a race interrupted several times by gusting crosswinds, Vonn wore the No. 4 bib and was left standing at the start gate during the first delay of about three minutes. She stayed warm with a thick jacket draped on her shoulders.The surprise winner was Jasmine Flury of Switzerland, who had a career-best World Cup finish of fifth before Saturday.Perhaps the outspoken Lindsey Vonn will get her wish and not have to represent the President or decline his invitation to the White House ",politics,"Dec 9, 2017"
"BREAKING NEWS: Woman Who Narrated BRUTAL TORTURE, Scalping of Mentally Disabled Young Man On Live Facebook Video Gets DISTURBING Sentence","When four Chicago thugs videotaped the brutal tortured a young mentally disabled man they kidnapped in a live Facebook video, Americans were stunned. Almost immediately after the discovery was made, the spokesperson for the Chicago Police Department called it a  stupid mistake .The superintendent of the building where the torture took place, shrugged off the horrific event by simply saying,  Kids make stupid mistakes. It looks like not much has changed in the attitudes of Chicago officials tasked with holding criminals accountable, especially in the case of four repulsive young thugs, who scalped the young 18-year old man, made him drink from a toilet, forced him to yell,  F*ck Trump  and  F*ck white people , and repeatedly hit him while his hands were tied and his mouth was covered with duct tape.The video is hard to watch but is an honest look at the anti-Trump and racist monsters who ve been given a pass by our media. Go HERE to watch the disturbing video. (***Warning***the video is very graphic).It was just announced that in a plea deal, Brittany Covington, 19, the narrator of the video, who had been held at the Cook County Jail without bond since January, will be the first of the four to be released. In a shocking case of injustice, the plea deal states that Covington will remain on probation for four years and is barred from contact with 2 of the other 3 co-criminals, Cooper and Hill, the Chicago Sun-Times is reporting.Other terms of the plea agreement bars Covington from using social media for four years, the Cook County State s Attorney s Office tells CBS 2.Brittany Covington narrated Facebook Live video of the others tormenting an 18-year-old white man in the apartment she shared with her sister.The victim, a Crystal Lake man who had been classmates with Hill at a west suburban alternative high school, appears terror-stricken as he was taunted with racially-tinged insults   including calling him a supporter of then-President-elect Donald Trump. Hill and Cooper allegedly cut his clothing with a knife, punched and kicked him. In another video, the man was forced to drink water from a toilet bowl.In one of the videos the defendants allegedly posted on Facebook, a man threatened the victim with a knife. Someone told the victim,  kiss the floor, b -!  and  nobody can help you anymore.  At one point, someone told the victim,  say  I love black people.   When a woman who lived in the building complained about the the noise and threatened to call the police, the sisters kicked in the woman s door in anger and took some of her property, police said. While the others had run to the other apartment, the victim managed to escape, and police found him, wearing shorts and his torn clothing in the January weather, a block away. Streamwood police officials say the victim s parents had made a missing-persons report after their son didn t return home.During the Streamwood police investigation, the victim s parents started  receiving text messages from persons claiming to be holding him captive,  officials said.Plea negotiations are ongoing with her three co-defendants, all of whom also have been in custody.

"ITS WORSE THAN THEY THOUGHT: Doctors Discover US Embassy Victims In Cuba Have BRAIN ABNORMALITIES&Never Before Seen Illness","In a last-minute attempt to create a legacy for himself, Obama traveled to Cuba to hang out with Raul Castro and prove to Americans how easy it is to form relations with brutal dictators of oppressive regimes.  Unfortunately for Barack Obama, it was not his finest moment, and his attempt to normalize relations with Cuba didn t work out so well for members of our US Embassy, who have now been diagnosed with  brain abnormalities , after experiencing some sort of attack that many experts suspect was inflicted with a sonic weapon.  The left rejoiced when President Barack Obama decided to normalize relations with the Cuban regime, reopened our embassy, and allowed travel to the island.But most of that has come to a screeching halt after mysterious attacks on our diplomats, which have caused serious health problems. The State Department has decided to recall all non-essential personnel from the embassy and urged Americans not to travel to Cuba.  Legal InsurrectionThe leftist Boston Globe publication gushed over Barack Obama s historic visit to Cuba.When President Obama travels to Cuba on Sunday with his family, he is making a vital foreign policy statement, and not just about the small island off the tip of Florida. The bigger principle at play is the value of diplomatic engagement over isolation, cooperation versus Cold War thinking. The visit   the first time a sitting American president has been to Cuba in almost 90 years   is a manifestation of the hope that democratic ideals can spread over time once normalized relations are established.Obama will not only be meeting with President Raul Castro, but also with middle-class Cubans, entrepreneurs, and political dissidents, a symbolic yet reassuring move on behalf of democracy and fairness. Already the opening of relations is bearing fruit, with new businesses sprouting and a flourishing tourism industry taking root.Legal Insurrection   The attacks on American officials at the U.S. Embassy in Havana, Cuba, keeps getting stranger and stranger. The latest information revealed that doctors have found brain abnormalities in the victims. From The Associated Press:It s the most specific finding to date about physical damage, showing that whatever it was that harmed the Americans, it led to perceptible changes in their brains. The finding is also one of several factors fueling growing skepticism that some kind of sonic weapon was involved.Medical testing has revealed the embassy workers developed changes to the white matter tracts that let different parts of the brain communicate, several U.S. officials said, describing a growing consensus held by university and government physicians researching the attacks. White matter acts like information highways between brain cells.Some of the victims woke up in the middle of the night and heard  disembodied chirping in the room, or a strange, low hum, or the sound of scraping metal.  Others described how  they felt a phantom flutter of air pass by as they listened.  There are some victims that did not notice anything.But the victims felt the effects of these noises or non-noises 24 hours later. These symptoms included nausea, loss of hearing or sight, headaches, vertigo, and dizziness. Symptoms appeared to have gone away once the victims came back to America. At first officials and doctors believed a sonic weapon caused the issues. Now they don t know.The officials did not say if the doctors found these changes in all of the victims. Elisa Konofagou, a Columbia University biomedical engineering professor, told the AP that  acoustic waves have never been shown to alter the brain s white matter tracts  and she  would be very surprised  if that is the cause of the abnormalities.From The Washington Post: Physicians are treating the symptoms like a new, never-seen-before illness,  the AP wrote, and expect to monitor the victims for the rest of their lives, although most have fully recovered from their symptoms by now.The physicians are working with FBI agents and intelligence agencies as they look for a source, and U.S. officials have not backed down from their accusations against the Cuban government, which denies any involvement despite a history of animosity between the two countries.In October, experts provided the mysterious noise to the Ap. It s high pitched, almost like nails on a chalkboard. They do not know what kind of mechanism produced this sound or who developed it. Those who heard a sound heard the same thing:Yet the AP has reviewed several recordings from Havana taken under different circumstances, and all have variations of the same high-pitched sound. Individuals who have heard the noise in Havana confirm the recordings are generally consistent with what they heard. That s the sound,  one of them said.As the number of affected have risen, the State Department had no choice but to take action to protect our people. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson decided in late September to bring home all non-essential personnel from the U.S. Embassy in Havana, thus cutting the staff by 60% and halt citizen travel to the island.A few days later, Tillerson decided to expel 15 diplomats from the Cuban Embassy in Washington, D.C.Instead of a legacy of a great man who built much-needed bridges with legitimate foreign nations, Barack Hussein Obama, the community organizer turned President, is left with the legacy of creating the most divided United States of America since the Civil War.

He also served as an assistant U.S. attorney in the National Security and Terrorism Unit in Alexandria, Virginia.Also, in 2015 when he was a lawyer, he represented Justin Cooper, the IT staffer who personally set up Hillary Clinton s unsecured server in her Chappaqua home, Fox News  Tucker Carlson revealed on his show Thursday.Cooper, it so happens, is also the aide who destroyed Clinton s old BlackBerries with a hammer.Watch the brilliant television ad Ted Cruz s team made during the election, that mocked Hillary Clinton and Justin Cooper for destroying evidence of her crimes, when they smashed her Blackberrys with a hammer:Documents obtained by Fox News show that Senate investigators grew frustrated with Zebley after being repeatedly stonewalled when they were trying to set up a meeting with Cooper. Mr. Zebley telephoned Homeland Security [Committee] staff to inform them that Cooper had chosen to cancel the interview,  the documents said.In a letter to Cooper, congressional investigators complained:  We are troubled by your attorney s [referring to Zebley] complete refusal to engage the committee in a discussion about how to further assuage your concerns. Let this sink in.

"DONALD TRUMP DIET&LIFELONG LIBERAL Tells  How His Leftist Friends Caused Him To Lose 7 Pounds After He Defended Donald Trump [VIDEO]","Every single day, liberals provide more and more evidence that Donald Trump Derangement Syndrome is a real thing. After the treatment liberal Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz received from his leftist friends for defending the law, and in the process defending President Trump, will he ever be able to embrace the people he used to believe were  tolerant  and  open-minded ?  WFB   Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz said Friday that he has lost seven pounds because his liberal friends have stopped inviting him to dinner parties for defending President Donald Trump against Democrats calling for him to be charged with obstruction of justice. Fox and Friends  co-host Ainsley Earhardt asked Dershowitz, a lifelong liberal who has donated thousands of dollars to Democrats, about liberals shunning him, noting that he usually agrees with liberals when he appears on the show. Well, I call it the Donald Trump diet,  Dershowitz said with a smile.  I ve lost seven pounds because my liberal friends have stopped inviting me to dinner parties. After four years, I ll be back to my high school weight. He added that many liberals do not want to understand his view and immediately accuse him of being on Trump s side.WATCH: I m on nobody s side. I m on the side of the rule of law, the Constitution, and the Constitution is clear [that if] a president exercises his constitutional authority by firing somebody or by pardoning somebody, that cannot be the basis for obstruction of justice,  Dershowitz said.  If he goes further and lies or tells his people to destroy evidence, of course, that s different. That s how [Richard] Nixon and [Bill] Clinton got in trouble, but President [Trump] cannot be charged with obstruction for simply exercising his Article 2 power under the Constitution. And that s the point of view you expressed on this program a couple of days ago,  co-host Steve Doocy added.  And then the president of the United States retweeted,  Hey you should watch Alan Dershowitz on Fox and Friends make that case,  but then your liberal friends, their heads started exploding, and I understand somebody even suggested that you re being paid off by the Trump people. Dershowitz mocked the idea that he is being paid off or that he wants to become a Supreme Court justice at the age of 79. He then mentioned that he also is being attacked for his article supporting Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital. I m being criticized for that by people because that s what Trump said, and if Trump said it, that means Dershowitz can t say it because that means Dershowitz is on Trump s side,  Dershowitz said.  I m on the side of justice and fairness. ",politics,"Dec 8, 2017"

"WI GOV. SCOTT WALKER: If Youre Able-Bodied and Want Welfare, Youre Going To Be Drug-Tested","If you live in Wisconsin and want your working neighbors to fund your existence, you may need to start peeing in a cup to prove your dependency on the government isn t related to your dependency on drugs. The governor of Wisconsin is a love em  or hate em  kind of leader. Conservatives love him for making public sector unions pay more of their own benefits,  liberals hate him for daring to stand up to the powerful, organized mega-donors of the Democrat Party. Governor Walker is about to shake things up again in the blue state of Wisconsin, and liberals are not gonna be happy Gov. Scott Walker is moving forward with an effort to drug test some food stamp recipients, with testing expected to begin in as little as a year absent action from lawmakers or the federal government.Wisconsin s Republican governor has submitted a plan to state lawmakers for drug testing able-bodied recipients of the state s Food Share program. If the state Legislature doesn t object within 120 days, the plan will go into effect, though it will take at least a year for actual testing to begin.The program won t necessarily have a massive effect, however. The Walker administration estimated in October that only about 220 food stamp recipients statewide   or just 0.3% of able-bodied adults   would test positive in the first year. Employers have jobs available, but they need skilled workers who can pass a drug test,  Walker said in a statement.  This rule change means people battling substance use disorders will be able to get the help they need to get healthy and get back into the workforce. A year ago, Walker had asked then President-elect Donald Trump and his incoming administration to clear the way for the change in the food stamp program, which is overseen by the state but largely funded by federal taxpayers. So far that hasn t happened but a Walker spokesman said Monday that the governor believes the state can proceed without any federal action. Our position is we have the authority to implement the rule,  spokesman Tom Evenson said.The now-departed appointees of President Barack Obama didn t see it that way. In January 2017, right before Trump took over the White House, the former U.S. official in charge of the replacement program to food stamps said such testing would require a change in federal law. The law clearly does not allow it,  said Kevin Concannon, undersecretary at the federal Food and Nutrition Service within the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Walker s  office forwarded that request to us and it was very clear, we consulted the legal counsels here and the law absolutely does not allow it. The Trump administration, however, may not see the issue in the same light.   Journal Sentinel ",politics,"Dec 8, 2017"
"PHILADELPHIA Committee Passes Bill Forcing Store Owners to Remove Bullet-Proof Glass&Because its Offensive","What s more important, protecting the dignity of customers who shop in local liquor stores, or the innocent employees and store owners who come in every day, knowing that the only thing that ensures they will go home alive, is the bullet-proof glass between them and the criminal element who enters their store? Well, according to one Philadelphia councilwoman, it s the dignity of the customers. Philadelphia s Public Health and Human Services Committee passed a bill Monday to ban shop owners from protecting themselves with bulletproof plexiglass.Philadelphia 8th District Councilwoman Cindy Bass, who is behind the bill, said previously that having to see plexiglass represents an  indignity  to her constituents and should, therefore, be banned.  Information LiberationFOX News   Philadelphia is one step closer to getting rid of bulletproof glass in many of its small businesses as part of a larger effort to crack down on loitering, public urination, and potential drug sales   but the potential ban has triggered a backlash from shopkeepers.The city s Public Health and Human Services Committee passed a bill Monday enabling Philadelphia s Department of Licenses and Inspections to regulate the bullet-resistant barricades that stand between customers and cash registers in many neighborhood corner stores, according to FOX29. No establishment required to obtain a Large Establishment license   shall erect or maintain a physical barrier that requires the persons serving the food either to open a window or other aperture or to pass the food through a window or other aperture, in order to hand the food to a customer inside the establishment,  the bill states. It also calls for larger establishments to have bathrooms for customers.Here s a great example of the crime Philadelphia officers deal with every day in a city where the elected officials are more worried about passing laws to protect the dignity of liquor store customers, and not the people who bravely come to work every day to sell goods in dangerous, crime-ridden neighborhoods.

"WHY THE MUELLER WITCH HUNT On President Trump Is Dead","Special Counsel Robert Mueller s anti-Trump witch hunt is dead, even if he doesn t realize it. While his investigation stumbles onward, with life support provided by the biased media, from a legal perspective the viability of any criminal case that Mueller could possibly bring has been effectively gutted thanks to the news (suppressed for months by Mueller s team) that the FBI s  key agent  in both the Russia investigation and the Clinton email probe was an ardent Hillary supporter with an anti-Trump bias.Under federal law, a prosecutor is required  to disclose exculpatory and impeachment information to criminal defendants and to seek a just result in every case.  Specifically, pursuant to Giglio v. United States:As a result, in any prosecution brought by Mueller against a Republican target, defense counsel would be entitled under the Constitution to all evidence in the government s possession relevant to exploring the apparent biases of FBI agent Peter Strzok and his animosity toward Trump and the Republican Party. This, in and of itself, could be a case-killer because it is very unlikely that Mueller or the DOJ would want defense counsel poring through all the records and documents, emails, and texts in the DOJ s and Strzok s possession revealing the agent s biases since this could fatally undermine any other cases or investigations the agent has worked on such as the FBI s decision to recommend charging General Flynn with lying to federal agents even though Hillary Clinton s besties, Cheryl Mills and Huma Abedin, were given a free pass despite apparently doing the same thing.Significantly, the fatal damage done to Mueller s anti-Trump investigation does not only rest in the fact that defense counsel will be able to conduct an unlubricated prostate examination on the FBI s key agent at trial. Instead, the real reason why Mueller will not risk a criminal trial is the lasting damage that would be done to the FBI s reputation by having Strzok s baggage brought into the daylight:For example, Jim Jordan skewered Chris Wray today on the Peter Strzok angle of investigation THIS is just the tip of the iceberg on what could be brought forward on this weasel:REMEMBER THAT STRZOK PLAYED A KEY ROLL IN  ANALYZING  THE TRUMP DOSSIER: Let s remember a couple of things about the dossier,  he said.

Aren t the U.S. Olympic athletes made aware fairly early on, that they re representing our nation? I don t remember ever seeing any of our athletes carrying a flag with a picture of the President of the United States, or wearing apparel covered with the President s image or name. So why is Lindsey Vonn making a statement about how she s not going to be representing President Trump? Does anyone really care about Lindsey Vonn s opinion about President Trump? FOX News  Olympic gold medal skier Lindsey Vonn says she ll represent the United States, but not President Trump, when she returns to the Winter Games in February.Vonn, who won a gold medal in the women s downhill competition in 2010 in Vancouver, skipped the 2014 Sochi games because of knee injuries.

"ARE SENATOR AL FRANKEN and REP JOHN CONYERS Being Sacrificed By The Democrat Party For A Much Larger Goal?","After two days of being criticized by mostly female, (and even some male) members of Congress, over multiple allegations of sexual misconduct, Democrat Al Franken just announced he s resigning from his US Senate seat. Democrat Representative John Conyers met a similar onslaught of criticism from fellow House members earlier in the week, which left him feeling isolated from his own party as he faced multiple allegations of sexual assault, misconduct and even accusations of a veiled death threat by one woman.After years of looking the other way while numerous women courageously stepped forward to accuse former President Bill Clinton of sexual assault and even rape, Democrats not only looked the other way, they nominated his wife who was accused by the same women of enabling his behavior as their choice for President of The United States.So why the sudden outrage over Franken and Conyers? Could it have something to do with the upcoming election for Senator in Alabama, where hard-core conservative Republican Judge Roy Moore appears to be ahead in the polls against Democrat candidate Doug Jones, despite being accused by several women of sexual misconduct that took place decades ago? So far, the motives or tactics of almost every one of Moore s accusers has been called into question. But this is not just any race, it s a race that the Democrats have dumped millions into, in hopes of taking a Senate seat they would otherwise have no chance of gaining in a deeply red state that overwhelmingly went for Trump in 2016. Democrat Senate candidate Doug Jones has never run for political office, opposes tax cuts for the rich and supports an expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare. The 63-year-old also is staunchly pro-choice, putting him at odds with embattled Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore, who is staunchly pro-life.There s one thing we know about the Democrats they know how to fight. If the Democrats can make an 11th-hour show of how  moral  they are, because they are suddenly able to rally against sexual predators in leadership roles in their party (even though they spent decades ignoring the Clinton s, or the biggest elephant in the room) perhaps they can convince voters to support Democrat Doug Moore over the  moral-less  Republican-backed candidate Roy Moore, and gain a Senate seat they could only have dreamed about 6 months ago. The Democrats haven t won a senate seat in Alabama since 1992.Let s face it, Senator Franken resides in a solidly blue state who went for Hillary in 2016. There s not much likelihood that they ll elect a Republican to replace him. When it comes to the 88-year old Conyers, he s not only nearing the end of his career, he s a representative in Detroit, where it doesn t matter who runs as long as they have a (D) behind their name. It s a 100% safe seat.So if sacrificing a few members of their own party means gaining a Senate seat, it s all worth it, right? After all, the media wouldn t dare call out their allies in the Democrat Party for their decades of hypocrisy, and for their undying support of accused rapist Bill Clinton and his lovely, enabling wife Meanwhile, the blue state of Minnesota still loves Al Franken:Minnesota s Star Tribune calls Senator Al Franken (D-MN)  A star in his party After eight years in the Senate, Franken had emerged as a powerful voice on progressive causes and forceful critic of the Trump administration, frequently generating national headlines with aggressive questioning of Trump s Cabinet officers. He was a star attraction for the Democratic Party, raising millions of dollars for candidates around the country and appearing frequently on nationally broadcast talk shows and in other high-profile venues.Franken s celebrity preceded his political career. He was hired as a staff writer for  Saturday Night Live  in its first season in 1975 and quickly became a regular on-air performer as well. He served two long stints on the show s staff, the second ending in 1995. After that, he published several bestselling books of political satire from a liberal point of view and hosted a nationally syndicated radio show for several years.Franken, who had been a vocal champion of women s rights and a popular, in-demand spokesman for various progressive causes, found himself caught up in a growing cultural movement around outing bad behavior toward women by men in positions of power. By abandoning Franken along with former U.S. Rep. John Conyers, who resigned earlier this week, Democrats are drawing a distinction between their party and Republicans at a time when President Trump has thrown his full weight behind Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, accused of sexual abuse of underage girls.A Democratic source told the Star Tribune that Dayton is likely to appoint Lt. Gov. Tina Smith and that she is not expected to run in the special election.88-year old Representative John Conyers (D-MI) was the longest-serving House Member in US history. ",politics,"Dec 7, 2017"

"WATCH: 3 PRESIDENTS Before Trump Promised To Move U.S. Embassy To Jerusalem","On Tuesday, Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California blasted President Trump for saying he would move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Feinstein claimed it would be a  terrible decision  even though she previously voted for the embassy to be moved. The hypocrisy of the left doesn t stop there Today, President Donald Trump announced that America formally recognizes Jerusalem as Israel s capital city, changing decades of U.S. policy in a brief afternoon speech and casting the move as a bid to preserve, not derail, aspirations for regional peace.The critics of Donald Trump attacked his decision. Meanwhile, the truth is, that for decades, some of the most beloved Democrats have used the promise of recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel as a way to get votes.In 1999, while campaigning for New York s US Senate seat, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton said in a letter, that she considered Jerusalem to be the  eternal and indivisible capital of Israel  and will be an active advocate   if elected to New York s Senate seat   to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem.In a letter that became public Thursday, Mrs. Clinton wrote:  If I am chosen by New Yorkers to be their senator, or in whatever position I find myself in the years to come, you can be sure that I will be an active, committed advocate for a strong and secure Israel, able to live in peace with its neighbors, with the United States Embassy located in its capital, Jerusalem. Hillary s not the only one to promise, that if elected, they would move heaven and earth to make Jerusalem the rightful capital of Israel. As it turns out, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama (twice) also made the same promise. The only problem is, none of them had the courage to do it.Watch:When President @realDonaldTrump announced that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, he fulfilled another campaign promise, in addition to those that go back 25 years . pic.twitter.com/P7M2dEx2qT  Dan Scavino Jr. (@DanScavino) December 7, 2017Here s why our courageous president, Donald Trump was right to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel:Matthew Continetti of the Washington Free Beacon wrote the best article on Trump s bold decision to move the US embassy to Jerusalem that we have seen to date.Not only is President Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and begin the process of moving the U.S. embassy there one of the boldest moves of his presidency. It is one of the boldest moves any U.S. president has made since the beginning of the Oslo  peace process  in 1993. That process collapsed at Camp David in 2000 when Yasir Arafat rejected President Clinton s offer of a Palestinian state. And the process has been moribund ever since, despite multiple attempts to restart it.That is why the warnings from Trump critics that his decision may wreck the peace process ring hollow. There is no peace process to wreck. The conflict is frozen. And the largest barriers to the resumption of negotiations are found not in U.S. or Israeli policy but in Palestinian autocracy, corruption, and incitement. Have the former Obama administration officials decrying Trump s announcement read a newspaper lately? From listening to them, you d think it would be all roses and ponies in the Middle East but for Trump. In fact, the region is engulfed in war, terrorism, poverty, and despotism; Israel faces threats in the north and south; its sworn enemy, Iran, is growing in influence and reach; and the delegitimization of the Jewish State proceeds apace in international organizations and on college campuses. I forget how the Obama administration advanced the cause of peace by pressuring Israel while rewarding the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world. Maybe someone will remind me.One of the reasons the Middle East persists in its decrepit condition is that it has been, for decades, a playground of magical thinking. Whether it is believing that poverty is the cause of terrorism or that the Ayatollah Khamenei is a good-faith partner, whether it is imagining that Assad will go just because we tell him to or that ISIS is akin to a terrorist  JV team,  liberal internationalists have all too eagerly accepted an alternative picture of the Middle East that is much more flattering than the actuality. A similar form of doublethink is present in our discussions over Jerusalem. Every Israeli knows Jerusalem was, is, and will remain his capital. Every recent president has agreed with him. And the U.S. consensus has been bipartisan. The last four Democratic platforms have said the obvious: that Jerusalem is Israel s capital. The Senate voted 90-0 only six months ago urging the embassy be moved to the ancient city. Were we to take seriously neither these platforms nor that vote? Was it all virtue-signaling, a bunch of empty gestures in the kabuki theater of U.S. diplomacy?It is a sign of the disingenuousness of American foreign policy that it required someone from outside this system to behave as if words have meaning. President Trump has no background in or admiration for the routines, manners, and norms of the U.S. foreign service, especially that part of it which specializes in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This has enabled him to state unequivocally the fact others would prefer to avoid: Jerusalem is Israel s capital, full stop. His transactional nature also brought him to this fateful recognition. In March 2016, at the AIPAC policy conference, he pledged that  We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem.  His remarks today make clear his intention to fulfill that promise and to cement his support within the pro-Israel community.I wonder about the journalists and flacks and politicians criticizing this literal reading of U.S. law as  disruptive.  Have they not paid attention to this man? Donald Trump s purpose in office is to disrupt if not overturn the patterns of governance and ideological consensus that have dominated the U.S. capital for decades. In this sense, his Jerusalem policy is his presidency in microcosm. He is acting on a common sense appraisal of the world and satisfying the wishes of his supporters without regard to global or domestic elite opinion. What Trump knows more than the art of the deal is the art of the bluff and how to call one. By keeping his campaign promise today, he has called the bluff of everyone who thought the United States could have its cake and eat it too on the question of Israel s capital. And by moving our embassy to Jerusalem, the United States will acknowledge Israel s right to determine its own capital city. That is not something to condemn or fear. It is something to be proud of.",politics,"Dec 6, 2017"
"HANDPICKED SUCCESSOR And Son Of DISGRACED Lawmaker John Conyers Reportedly Body-Slammed, Spit Upon and Slit His Girlfriend With Knife","The disgraced Representative John Conyers (D-MI) was not about to quit his job as an elected official before he hand-selected his son as his successor. Never mind that his son has absolutely no experience in politics. His last name is  Conyers , and that s apparently enough for the 88-year old politician. But is that really all they need to know about the 27-year old son of the disgraced lawmaker and the former Detroit councilwoman, Monica Conyers, who was recently released from prison after serving 2 years of a 3-year term for bribery?  And should anyone be surprised by anything that comes out of the mouth of the 88-year old lawmaker, who, in 2010, was caught on video, as he brazenly read a Playboy magazine on a domestic flight in plain view of other passengers, and who has recently been accused by multiple women of either sexually assaulting or attempting to sexually assault them.  John Conyers III also has an interesting background.According to NBC News, on February Feb. 15, John Conyers was arrested on suspicion of domestic abuse but wasn t charged, after his girlfriend called the police. The unidentified woman said the younger Conyers accused her of cheating on him, then  body slammed her on the bed and then on the floor where he pinned her down and spit on her,  according to a district attorney s report quoted by NBC News. The woman claimed that Conyers III took her phone when she tried to call the police, he chased her into the kitchen and swung a knife at her, resulting in a cut on her arm.Conyers III asserted that the woman had been drinking and using marijuana and tried to throw him out of her home before they began pushing and shoving one another. He said she threatened him with a knife and cut herself as they struggled.NBC reported that the Los Angeles County District Attorney s Office chose not to move forward with the case, citing a  lack of independent witnesses  and investigators  conclusions that it  could not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim s injury was not accidentally sustained.

I just want you to let you know that Harvey s a rapist and this is going to come out at some point,  Dunham said she told the campaign.  I think it s a really bad idea for him to host fund-raisers and be involved because it s an open secret in Hollywood that he has a problem with sexual assault. Dunham, who has professed  an incredible allegiance to Hillary,  claimed Schake told her she d relay the message to campaign manager Robby Mook, but that she was surprised at the warning.The controversial actress said she also told another Clinton campaign member, spokeswoman Adrienne Elrod, about Weinstein. Dunham said  the campaign had not responded to her concerns  about the disgraced megaproducer, who s been accused of sexually assaulting or harassing more than 100 women.Weinstein donated thousands of dollars to Clinton s political campaigns over the years, and it took the former secretary of state five days to break her silence following the accusations made against him. I was shocked and appalled by the revelations about Harvey Weinstein,  the 2016 Democratic presidential nominee said in a statement through campaign communications director Nick Merrill.  The behavior described by women coming forward cannot be tolerated. Their courage and the support of others is critical in helping to stop this kind of behavior.   Fox News ",politics,"Dec 6, 2017"

"WHY TRUMP IS RIGHT To Recognize Jerusalem As Israels Capital","After it was announced that President Trump was seriously considering moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, he was roundly criticized by the anti-Trump media. Today, Democrats have announced they are drawing up the impeachment papers. Pope Francis appealed to President Trump to reconsider his decision so as not to offend anyone. In his appeal, Pope Francis said,  Jerusalem is a unique city, sacred to Jews, Christians, and Muslims who venerate the holy places of their respective religions, and has a special vocation to peace.   And yawn in Gaza, where the more things change, the more they stay the same, Palestinians burned the U.S. and Israeli flags.The media will try to make everyone believe that Palestinians loved us when Obama was President, even though there is no truth to that fantasy. (See image below)Daily Mail   President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that America formally recognizes Jerusalem as Israel s capital city, changing decades of U.S. policy in a brief afternoon speech and casting the move as a bid to preserve, not derail, aspirations for regional peace.Appearing in the White House s Diplomatic Reception Room against an elaborate backdrop of Christmas decorations, He also said the United States embassy in Israel would, over time, be moved there from Tel Aviv.Israel is the only country where the United States has an embassy in a city that the host nation does not consider its capital. I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,  Trump said.  While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today I am delivering. When I came into office I promised to look at the world s challenges with open eyes and very fresh thinking,  he said, leaning heavily on a mid-1990s federal law that demanded the embassy s relocation. We have declined to acknowledge any Israeli capital   at all,  Trump added.  But today we finally acknowledge the obvious, that Jerusalem is Israel s capital. This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do. It is something that has to be done. Matthew Continetti of the Washington Free Beacon seems to think so. Continetti wrote the best piece on Trump s bold decision to move the embassy that we have seen to date.Not only is President Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and begin the process of moving the U.S. embassy there one of the boldest moves of his presidency. It is one of the boldest moves any U.S. president has made since the beginning of the Oslo  peace process  in 1993. That process collapsed at Camp David in 2000 when Yasir Arafat rejected President Clinton s offer of a Palestinian state. And the process has been moribund ever since, despite multiple attempts to restart it.That is why the warnings from Trump critics that his decision may wreck the peace process ring hollow. There is no peace process to wreck. The conflict is frozen. And the largest barriers to the resumption of negotiations are found not in U.S. or Israeli policy but in Palestinian autocracy, corruption, and incitement. Have the former Obama administration officials decrying Trump s announcement read a newspaper lately? From listening to them, you d think it would be all roses and ponies in the Middle East but for Trump. In fact, the region is engulfed in war, terrorism, poverty, and despotism; Israel faces threats in the north and south; its sworn enemy, Iran, is growing in influence and reach; and the delegitimization of the Jewish State proceeds apace in international organizations and on college campuses. I forget how the Obama administration advanced the cause of peace by pressuring Israel while rewarding the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world. Maybe someone will remind me.A similar form of doublethink is present in our discussions over Jerusalem. Every Israeli knows Jerusalem was, is, and will remain his capital. Every recent president has agreed with him. And the U.S. consensus has been bipartisan. The last four Democratic platforms have said the obvious: that Jerusalem is Israel s capital. The Senate voted 90-0 only six months ago urging the embassy be moved to the ancient city. Were we to take seriously neither these platforms nor that vote? Was it all virtue-signaling, a bunch of empty gestures in the kabuki theater of U.S. diplomacy?It is a sign of the disingenuousness of American foreign policy that it required someone from outside this system to behave as if words have meaning. President Trump has no background in or admiration for the routines, manners, and norms of the U.S. foreign service, especially that part of it which specializes in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This has enabled him to state unequivocally the fact others would prefer to avoid: Jerusalem is Israel s capital, full stop. His transactional nature also brought him to this fateful recognition. In March 2016, at the AIPAC policy conference, he pledged that  We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem.  His remarks today make clear his intention to fulfill that promise and to cement his support within the pro-Israel community.I wonder about the journalists and flacks and politicians criticizing this literal reading of U.S. law as  disruptive.  Have they not paid attention to this man? Donald Trump s purpose in office is to disrupt if not overturn the patterns of governance and ideological consensus that have dominated the U.S. capital for decades. In this sense, his Jerusalem policy is his presidency in microcosm. He is acting on a common sense appraisal of the world and satisfying the wishes of his supporters without regard to global or domestic elite opinion. What Trump knows more than the art of the deal is the art of the bluff and how to call one. By keeping his campaign promise today, he has called the bluff of everyone who thought the United States could have its cake and eat it too on the question of Israel s capital. And by moving our embassy to Jerusalem, the United States will acknowledge Israel s right to determine its own capital city. That is not something to condemn or fear. It is something to be proud of.

BOOM!Tillerson s no nonsense style hit this reporter right between the eyes:Tillerson s comments came during a press conference at NATO headquarters in Brussels, where Associated Press reporter Josh Lederman asked the nation s top diplomat why he has not quit amid multiple reports, citing Trump administration officials, that the White House has developed a plan to oust Tillerson and replace him with CIA Director Mike Pompeo, who in turn would be replaced by Republican Sen. Tom Cotton (Ark.). On several occasions, the president has publicly undermined your diplomatic efforts,  Lederman said.  In recent days, White House officials have said that you are going to be pushed out. And these are not media inventions; these are coming from the White House. Many Americans see these efforts as humiliating to you,  Lederman continued.  You have had an illustrious career. Why do you put up with it? Why don t you quit? The press keeps pushing but they re not getting answers from Tillerson who had been rumored to be leaving the Trump administration in January.

"BARACK OBAMA GOES THERE&Compares President Trump To Hitler In Front Of Chicago Audience","Crains Chicago Business   American democracy is fragile, and unless care is taken it could follow the path of Nazi Germany in the 1930s.Mixed in with many softer comments, that was the somewhat jaw-dropping bottom line of Barack Obama last night as, in a Q&A session before the Economic Club of Chicago, the Chicagoan who used to be president dropped a bit of red meat to a hometown crowd that likely is a lot closer to him than the man whose name never was mentioned: President Donald Trump.Obama s comments came after a series of playful questions from moderator and Ariel Investments President Mellody Hobson in the great Batman vs. Superman debate, for instance, we learned Obama sides with Batman before she eventually asked him what he s learned as a world citizen of sorts.One thing he s learned is that  things don t happen internationally if we don t put our shoulder to the wheel,  Obama said, speaking of the U.S.  No other country has the experience and bandwith and ideals. . . .If the U.S. doesn t do it, it s not going to happen. Obama gave one specific example, but it was a solid one: Ebola. To fight the virus the U.S. did everything from build an airport tarmac in Africa to send in medical teams and ferry medicos from other countries.  We probably saved a million lives by doing that,  he said.At least indirectly, those comments could be seen as criticism of Trump, whose foreign policy focuses on an  America first  paradigm that critics say distracts from this country s unique role.Obama moved from that to talking about a nativist mistrust and unease that has swept around the world. He argued that such things as the speed of technical change and the uneven impact of globalization have come too quickly to be absorbed in many cultures, bringing strange new things and people to areas in which  people didn t (used to) challenge your assumptions.  As a result,  nothing feels solid,  he said.  Sadly, there s something in us that looks for simple answers when we re agitated. Still, the U.S. has survived tough times before and will again, he noted, particularly mentioning the days of communist fighter Joseph McCarthy and former President Richard Nixon. But one reason the country survived is because it had a free press to ask questions, Obama added. Though he has problems with the media just like Trump has had,  what I understood was the principle that the free press was vital. The danger is  grow(ing) complacent,  Obama said.  We have to tend to this garden of democracy or else things could fall apart quickly. That s what happened in Germany in the 1930s which, despite the democracy of the Weimar Republic and centuries of high-level cultural and scientific achievements, Adolph Hitler rose to dominate, Obama noted.  Sixty million people died. . . .So, you ve got to pay attention. And vote. ",politics,"Dec 6, 2017"
"KATIE HOPKINS WARNS AMERICANS Of Grave Danger Ahead: Do Not Let This Great Country Become The United Kingdom [VIDEO]","Former British Army officer, outspoken, conservative, radio and tv talk show host, Katie Hopkins warned Americans to fight back against the appeasement and political correctness in the United States of America.British conservative icon, Katie Hopkins gave a blistering speech about the dangers of political correctness and appeasement at the David Horowitz Restoration weekend in Palm Beach, Florida. Look at us, let us be a warning. Be better than us. I ve watched my country fall apart, and I want to warn others before they let their country do the same. And believe me, I love my country. Katie touched on many topics that most Americans are afraid to address. Hopkins reveals a horrifying story of a Muslim woman, who along with her boyfriend, was recently sentenced to prison, after a plot to behead Hopkins was uncovered. Hopkins also shares horrifying stories of multiple British citizens who have lost their lives, their limbs or suffer serious scars, as a result of acts of jihad against them by Muslim immigrants in their homeland of  Great Britain, after their nation welcomed them in with open arms. Do not allow America to fall as Europe has fallen, Hopkins told the crowd.Hopkins started out her speech with her usual biting and politically incorrect humor, by assuring the crowd she is not the outspoken, gay, conservative Milo Yiannopoulis. She then assured the audience that she was not gay simply because she wears her short. In fact, Hopkins calls herself a minority in London, because she s a white, married, mother of three, telling the audience that she s now on the  extinct list  in the UK.Hopkins tells of the time she spent in the migrant camps in Calais and tells horrifying stories of how the workers conform to the rule of Islam, so as not to offend the migrants they are taking care of. She tells a story of a mother who dresses her young daughter as a son, so the migrant men don t come into their tent to rape her daughter at night.  Hopkins admitted that she was  naive , and that she quickly realized,  Migrants don t come for a new life and leave their old life behind. They bring them with them. All the old conflicts from back home. The Eritreans hate the Somalis who hate the Afghanis who don t speak to the Libyans. And they re still fighting. They come, they do not start a new life, they bring their conflicts from back home. Watch Hopkins powerful speech here (some language may be offensive):",politics,"Dec 6, 2017"
"HYPOCRISY: DEMOCRAT SENATOR Criticizes President Trump For Moving U.S. Embassy To Jerusalem After She Voted To Move U.S. Embassy To Jerusalem","You just can t make up stories like these Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein (Calif.) on Tuesday castigated the idea of moving the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, saying it would be a  terrible decision  despite previously voting for the embassy move to take place. Reports indicate the president will move the U.S. embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem,  the California senator tweeted.  I wrote him last week to explain why that would be a terrible decision. In an attached letter to Trump dated Dec. 1, Feinstein wrote that moving the embassy would  spark violence and embolden extremists on both sides of this debate. Here is the tweet:Reports indicate the president will move the U.S. Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. I wrote him last week to explain why that would be a terrible decision. pic.twitter.com/MV1o73nyDk  Sen Dianne Feinstein (@SenFeinstein) December 5, 2017The California Democrat stressed that the U.S. must remain neutral in the debate over Jerusalem s status, and that moving the U.S. embassy there or recognizing the city as the capital of Israel would  undermine any remaining hope for a two-state solution. Feinstein s tweet came on the same day that President Donald Trump told Israeli and Arab leaders that he plans to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital and move the embassy there. Trump is expected to announce his decision on Wednesday.Moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem would be in line with a law that Congress passed in 1995 requiring  the relocation of the United States embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.  The measure, which also called for the U.S. to recognize the city as the undivided capital of Israel, passed the Senate by an overwhelming 93-5 margin.Among the senators who voted for the initial Jerusalem Embassy Act was one Dianne Feinstein.Feinstein actually played a key role in getting the bill passed by inserting a provision that would allow the president to issue a waiver to delay the embassy move six months at a time, if the president determined it was in the U.S. national security interest.Feinstein s move led 10 additional Democratic members to support the bill, giving it a veto-proof majority.Via: WFB",politics,"Dec 5, 2017"

"JUST IN: UK LEADER Who Criticized President Trump For Tweeting About ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS Is Victim Of Assassination Plot By ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS","According to CNN  UK Prime Minister Theresa May delivered a rare public admonishment to US President Donald Trump on Thursday, declaring that he was  wrong  to share anti-Muslim videos posted online by a  hateful  British far-right group.May, facing intense pressure to cancel a planned state visit by Trump, was forced to address the controversy in person after the President criticized her on Twitter. But she insisted the US-UK relationship would survive the storm, and suggested the visit by Trump would go ahead.As the extraordinary diplomatic clash stretched into a second day, the British ambassador to the US revealed he had expressed concerns to the White House about the affair. Trump also faced an unprecedented barrage of criticism in UK Parliament, where MPs variously called him  racist,   fascist  and  evil.  Some suggested he should quit Twitter.Donald Trump responded to Theresa May s criticism of his Britain First retweets by tweeting back to her: Theresa@theresamay, don t focus on me, focus on the destructive Radical Islamic Terrorism that is taking place within the United Kingdom. We are doing just fine! Many, including us, wonder if British Prime Minister Theresa May is still feeling the same way about Islamic extremists in the UK after her own life was threatened by the same group of people she attempted to defend last week.Less than one week later, British Intelligence announced that they ve foiled a plot by Islamic extremists to assassinate Prime Minister Theresa May.The disrupted plot against May included an explosive device that terrorists planned to detonate in front of May s residence on Downing Street, according to Sky News. It is in essence an extreme Islamist suicide plot against Downing Street,  Sky correspondent Martin Brunt said. Essentially police believe that the plan was to launch some sort of improvised explosive device at Downing Street and in the ensuing chaos attack and kill Theresa May, the Prime Minister. Sky s Crime Correspondent Martin Brunt said:  It s the latest in a number of terror plots that police and MI5 believe they ve foiled this year. I understand that the head of MI5, Andrew Parker, briefed Cabinet ministers today, such is the seriousness of what they believed they have uncovered. It is in essence an extreme Islamist suicide plot against Downing Street. Essentially police believe that the plan was to launch some sort of improvised explosive device at Downing Street and in the ensuing chaos attack and kill Theresa May, the Prime Minister.

"PRESIDENT TRUMP Goes Shopping&Hes a Hit!","The photos from President Trump s visit to the food storehouse for LDS families in need are great. President Donald Trump created quite a stir when he pushed a shopping cart down a food aisle at the LDS Church Bishops  Central Storehouse in Salt Lake City.The state-of-the-art facility from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was built to better enable the church to help families in need.THUMBS UP! This is very exciting for me,  Trump added.  I know so many people that are in your church, the Latter-day Saints. The job you ve done is beyond anything you could think of   taking care of people the way you take care of people and the respect that you have all over the world. CHECKING HIS LISTTrump said Monday that he s pressing Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who accompanied the president on his visit, to run for an eighth term, but when asked if he was trying to block Mitt Romney from running for the seat, the president was complimentary of the former GOP presidential nominee. He s a good man. Mitt s a good man,  he said, according to the Deseret News.

"JUST IN: AS ANOTHER ACCUSER COMES FORWARD&JohnConyers Makes Major Announcement&Its Not What The Media Expected","What pushed Democrat Congressman John Conyers to resign instead of just announce he would retire at the end of his term?The Detroit Free Press reports another accuser came forward just last night:The most recent, Elisa Grubbs, made accusations against Conyers on Monday night, saying in a statement that Conyers put his hand up her skirt at a church, among other allegations.As late as Tuesday morning, there were reports that Conyers would fight on, choosing to remain in office til the end of his current term and then retire in early 2019. But speaking on Mildred Gaddis  show on WPZR-FM (102.7), Conyers said he was resigning.FORCED TO RESIGN:Facing a rising chorus of voices demanding he step down because of sexual harassment claims, U.S. Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Detroit, resigned the seat he has held for more than five decades, a swift and crushing fall from grace for a civil rights icon and the longest-serving active member of Congress.ENDORSES HIS SON TO REPLACE HIM:Saying he was finalizing his plans for retirement, Conyers added he would endorse his son, John Conyers III, to replace him Congress. My legacy can t be compromised or dimished in any way by what we re going through now. This too shall pass.   My legacy will continue through my children,  Conyers told Mildred Gaddis on her Detroit radio show.As for the accusations against him, Conyers said,  They re not accurate, they re not true and they re something I can t explain where they came from. Conyers, 88, resigned two weeks after an article on BuzzFeed.com detailed a secret settlement of more than $27,000 with former staffer, MARION BROWN who accused him of making sexual advances toward her and paying her out of funds from his taxpayer-supported office.MARION BROWN CAME FORWARD WITH SHOCKING DETAILS:The descriptions below of what went on at the office of Rep. John Conyers will make your blood boil. He felt entitled to treat the women in his office like he owned them in every way. It s pretty disgusting.We re still waiting to hear what s going to happen with Conyers. Democrat leaders have called for him to resign but his lawyer has been pushing back trying to make the accuser look bad. He treads a fine line with his threats to the accuser and to others in D.C. We re hoping he spills the beans on the others who have used our tax dollars to pay off sexual harassment victims.Marion Brown, a former staff member whose accusations have sparked the scandal surrounding embattled U.S. Rep. John Conyers, described in an interview Thursday how the Detroit congressman allegedly created a hostile work environment for his female staffers and, at times, pressed her for sexual favors, particularly when his wife was away. He owns you when you are there,  Brown said in the interview with Stephen Henderson, host of  Detroit Today  on WDET-FM (101.9) and editorial page editor at the Free Press. At one time, it was said amongst staff members  females  that he thinks that his initials, J.C., stand for Jesus Christ,  she said.Brown said Conyers would  invite me to a hotel in the guise of business, and then it turns into something else.   And this happened too often. And that was throughout. She said the sexual advances intensified whenever his wife, Monica Conyers, was out of town. He seemed to have taken on the attitude that  I m gonna go for it now. My wife s away, and I have these needs and I m going to call you up in the middle of the night,   Brown said. I know it s because he decided that he wanted to stop the hunting game,  Brown said.  He had no more interest in trying to persuade and seduce me into, you know, sex  or being his side piece. During that interview, she shared details of Conyers  alleged sexual advances toward her, including how Conyers in 2005 allegedly invited her to his Chicago hotel room and, while in his underwear, pointed to his genitals and asked her to  touch it.

Carlson and Goldstein argued this by comparing Clinton and Flynn s respective lies, and whether the FBI ever tried to lead Clinton into a perjury trap like Carlson insisted that they did with Flynn. There s a double standard,  Carlson insisted.  [Flynn s] name is tarnished for life because he lied in his conversation with FBI agents. Hillary Clinton got a special deal where she was not speaking under oath to FBI agents. Who gets that deal? Goodstein retorted that Carlson was trying to  make something out of nothing,  saying that Clinton would ve been subject to triable charges even if her conversations with the FBI were not held under oath. Carlson went on to accuse Goldstein of  intentionally missing my point  about Strzok s partisanship and redefining the legalities at play in Clinton s investigation. Why in time and again are you saying the FBI refused to respond to Congress when its own integrity is in question,  Carlson asked.  That is a cover-up. ",politics,"Dec 4, 2017"
"Basketball Dad LaVar Ball Yanks His Son Out of UCLA&You Wont Believe Why!","The father of the UCLA basketball player who had been suspended for shoplifting in China has just pulled his son from the college. He believes the suspension of his son was  unfair Can you believe this guy? He s so lucky his son isn t still stuck in China but was lucky enough to have President Trump save his azz  TMZ reported the following:It s a stunning move   LiAngelo Ball will no longer be on the UCLA basketball team and, in fact, he will not be a student at UCLA   because his father, LaVar Ball, is removing him from the institution   TMZ Sports has learned.   We re told LaVar believes the suspension was unfair, especially since the charges were dropped. LaVar s people tell TMZ Sports the famous dad thinks,  There s no need to break down a kid s spirit for making a mistake.  Our sources say LiAngelo is not officially withdrawn from the school but he s at home and will not return to UCLA. This is huge news, but hardly surprising. The writing has been on the wall for this one ever since it happened. UCLA suspended him as soon as he returned to America, and now it looks like he ll never ever play a single second on the court for the Bruins.What a wild turn of events. One day you re a big time recruit for UCLA, the next you re getting arrested in China and before long you re out of school.This father made the wrong move too bad for his son.IN CASE YOU HAVEN T HEARD OF WHAT A TOTAL JERK THIS FATHER WAS TO PRESIDENT TRUMP:Send this kid back to China! The ungrateful attitude of the father of LiAngelo Ball is so classless. What s even worse the dad makes excuses and even dismisses the son s crime as no big deal:  They try to make a big deal out of nothing sometimes.  I m from L.A. I ve seen a lot worse things happen than a guy taking some glasses.    LaVar Ball, father of UCLA player with  sticky fingers And we wonder why we have little thugs who aren t remorseful for their crimes? The sense of entitlement stinks to high heaven! Bad parenting LaVar Ball! WHO? Days after President Donald Trump touted his role in the release of three UCLA basketball students who were arrested in China, LaVar Ball, the father of one of those players, suggested the President had little to do with the matter. Who?  Ball told ESPN when asked about Trump s involvement in the situation.  What was he over there for? Don t tell me nothing. Everybody wants to make it seem like he helped me out. Trump s social media director, Dan Scavino, fired back at Ball on his personal Twitter account Saturday afternoon, saying Ball s son, LiAngelo,  would be in China for a long, long, long time  without the President s assistance. Wannabe @Lakers coach, BIG MOUTH @Lavarbigballer knows if it weren t for President @realDonaldTrump, his son would be in China for a long, long, long time! #FACT,  Scavino wrote.LiAngelo Ball, along with two other players, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill, were arrested last week on suspicion of stealing sunglasses from a Louis Vuitton store while their team was in the Chinese city of Hangzhou. Trump had said he personally asked Chinese President Xi Jinping to intervene in the case.On Wednesday, Trump issued a call for gratitude from the players on twitter. He did get a thanks for their release after his tweet.STICKY FINGERS NO BIG DEAL?Athletic Director Dan Guerrero confirmed the trio shoplifted from three stores near their hotel Monday night. The three were identified the next morning after police searched their bags and found the stolen items.LaVar Ball told ESPN he was happy to have his son back, and also seemed to downplay his alleged crime. As long as my boy s back here, I m fine,  he said.  I m happy with how things were handled. A lot of people like to say a lot of things that they thought happened over there.

"JUST IN: SUPREME COURT Rules On Trump Travel Ban","Another winner for America and for President Trump! The Supreme Court ruled in favor of the travel ban! Guess who voted against it Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor said they would have left the lower court orders in place. Is anyone surprised by the two lefty judges? Not us!Fox News reports:Handing the White House a huge judicial victory, the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday ruled in favor of President Trump s travel ban affecting residents of six majority-Muslim countries.The justices said the policy can take full effect despite multiple legal challenges against it that haven t yet made their way through the court system.The ban applies to people from Syria, Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia and Yemen.Lower courts had said people from those countries with a  bona fide  relationship with someone in the United States could not be prevented from entry.Grandparents and cousins were among the relatives courts said could not be excluded.The nine-member high court said in two one-page orders late Monday afternoon that lower court rulings that partly blocked the ban should be put on hold while appeals courts in Richmond, Va., and San Francisco take up the case.Liberal-leaning Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Sonia Sotomayor said they would have left the lower court orders in place.Both courts are scheduled to hear arguments in those cases this week.Both courts are also dealing with the issue on an accelerated basis, and the Supreme Court noted it expects those courts to reach decisions  with appropriate dispatch. Quick resolution by appellate courts would allow the Supreme Court to hear and decide the issue this term, by the end of June.Trump s travel ban has been challenged in separate lawsuits by Hawaii and the American Civil Liberties Union. Both have argued the ban discriminates against Muslims and should not go into effect under immigration laws.",politics,"Dec 4, 2017"
"JUST IN: FBI Supervisor Fired For Anti-Trump Texts Oversaw Michael Flynn Interviews","A supervisory special agent who is now under scrutiny after being removed from Robert Mueller s Special Counsel s Office for alleged bias against President Trump also oversaw the bureau s interviews of embattled former National Security advisor Michael Flynn, this reporter has learned. Flynn recently pled guilty to one-count of lying to the FBI last week.FBI agent Peter Strzok was one of two FBI agents who interviewed Flynn, which took place on Jan. 24, at the White House, said several sources. The other FBI special agent, who interviewed Flynn, is described by sources as a field supervisor in the  Russian Squad, at the FBI s Washington Field Office,  according to a former intelligence official, with knowledge of the interview.Strzok was removed from his role in the Special Counsel s Office after it was discovered he had made disparaging comments about President Trump in text messages between him and his alleged lover FBI attorney Lisa Page, according to the New York Times and Washington Post, which first reported the stories. Strzok is also under investigation by the Department of Justice Inspector General for his role in Hillary Clinton s email server and the ongoing investigation into Russia s election meddling. On Saturday, the House Intelligence Committee s Chairman Devin Nunes chided the Justice Department and the FBI for not disclosing why Strzok had been removed from the Special Counsel three months ago, according to a statement given by the Chairman.The former U.S. intelligence official told this reporter,  with the recent revelation that Strzok was removed from the Special Counsel investigation for making anti-Trump text messages it seems likely that the accuracy and veracity of the 302 of Flynn s interview as a whole should be reviewed and called into question. The most logical thing to happen would be to call the other FBI Special Agent present during Flynn s interview before the Grand Jury to recount his version,  the former intelligence official added.The former official also said that  Strzok s allegiance to (Deputy Director Andrew) McCabe was unwavering and very well known. Flynn, a retired three-star general, issued a statement on Dec. 1, saying,  it has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of  treason  and other outrageous acts. Such false accusations are contrary to everything I have ever done and stood for. But I recognize that the actions I acknowledged in court today were wrong, and, through my faith in God, I am working to set things right. According to another source, with direct knowledge of the Jan. 24 interview, McCabe had contacted Flynn by phone directly at the White House. White House officials had spent the  earlier part of the week with the FBI overseeing training and security measures associated with their new roles so it was no surprise to Flynn that McCabe had called,  the source said.McCabe told Flynn  some agents were heading over (to the White House) but Flynn thought it was part of the routine work the FBI had been doing and said they would be cleared at the gate,  the source said. It wasn t until after they were already in (Flynn s) office that he realized he was being formerly interviewed. He didn t have an attorney with him,  they added.Flynn s attorney Robert Kelner did not respond for comment. A former FBI agent said the investigation into Strzok and the reported text messages between him and Page, shows a  bias that cannot be ignored particularly if he had anything to do with Flynn s interview and his role in it. The former U.S. intelligence official questioned,  how logical is it that Flynn is being charged for lying to an agent whose character and neutrality was called into question by the Special Counsel. According to an anonymous source in The Washington Post, Strzok s and Page had exchanged a number of texts that  expressed anti-Trump sentiments and other comments that appeared to favor Clinton.

He s basically giving land back to the states that Clinton and Obama took for the federal government.The local leaders have applauded this move by Trump but the environmentalists are freaking out:President Trump signed two proclamations Monday shrinking federally protected lands in Utah in the largest rollback of national monument designations in history.The Bears Ears National Monument will shrink to 220,000 acres from its current 1.5 million-acre size, and the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument will be cut in half to about 1 million acres, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said.Trump s decision to roll back federal protections marks an unprecedented use of presidential power to shrink the national monument designations made by two of his predecessors.Trump said previous administrations overstepped their authority in declaring vast tracts of western lands off limits to use and development, abusing the  purpose, spirit and intent  of a century-old law known as the Antiquities Act. That law requires presidents to limit the monument designation to  the smallest area compatible with proper care and management of the objects to be protected. These abuses of the Antiquities Act give enormous power to faraway bureaucrats at the expense of people who work here, live here, and make this place their home,  Trump said at the Utah State Capital in Salt Lake City.

"DEMOCRATS Get DEVASTATING News After Spending $10.1 MILLION To Defeat Roy Moore In AL Senate Race","Roll Call   Democrat Doug Jones drastically outraised GOP nominee Roy Moore for the Alabama Senate race, new campaign finance documents show.Jones raised nearly six times Moore s amount ahead of the Dec. 12 special election to fill the Senate seat vacated by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Jones headed into the final weeks of the race with roughly four times as much money in the bank than his GOP opponent. Jones raked in nearly $10.2 million compared to Jones  $1.8 million. Jones also spent roughly 5 times as much as Moore during that period, nearly $8.7 million compared to Moore s $1.7 million.The Democrat Party, who up until just recently, was essentially broke, just got some very bad news today from reliable media ally, CBS News.As the majority of Alabama Republicans believe that the allegations against Judge Roy Moore are untrue, he now takes a commanding lead over radical leftist Democrat Doug Jones per a new CBS News poll.The CBS News/YouGov poll, conducted between Nov. 28 and Dec. 1, surveyed 1,037 Alabamians registered to vote in Alabama. It further segmented the poll results into some results among registered voters and others among likely voters. Among registered voters, the margin of error is 3.8 percent. Among likely voters, the margin of error is 4.8 percent. The results of the election, with Moore leading Jones, were broken down to likely voters.Another part broken down to likely voters was polling specifically about the allegations about Moore. Perhaps unsurprisingly, a significant number of Alabamians do not believe the allegations against Moore one bit.  Breitbart Despite all of the money Democrats have poured into the race, Alabama voters are not buying the media reports that decades ago, several women were victims of Republican Senate candidate Judge Roy Moore, who they are now accusing of being a sexual predator. After many of the women s claims were called into question, including the claim made by Beverly Young-Nelson, whose stepson said she s  lying  about having a sexual encounter with the judge, and whose yearbook that was allegedly signed by Roy Moore has been called into question as a forgery. And then there s another accuser, Tina Johnson who lost her 12-year old son to her mother in a  nasty  custody battle, in a case where Roy Moore represented her mother. It s entirely plausible that Roy Moore s sexual assault accuser, Tina Johnson, had an ax to grind with Moore, the person who was able to successfully prove to the court that Johnson was  unfit  to care for him.To add insult to injury, only yesterday, President Trump appeared with RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel to announce record-breaking fundraising of over $120 million, which McDaniel attributed to President Trump.Watch: ",politics,"Dec 3, 2017"

Everything she says below is a lie. She just makes it up as she goes along:  She went on to describe how  men who shaped the narrative  of the campaign harmed her but are now under fire for sexual harassment. Hillary Clinton thinks that former NBC host Matt Lauer s demise is  karma  for how he questioned her about her private email server during the 2016 presidential campaign.Clinton was in Philadelphia on Thursday promoting her campaign memoir, What Happened, when she was asked about Lauer being fired this week over allegations of sexual misconduct, the Philly Voice reported. Lauer faced a storm of criticism last year when several journalists and commentators deemed his questioning of Clinton at a candidate forum unfair and even sexist.

"JUST IN: VIDEO SHOWS Obama State Department Telling Reporters They Have No Problem With General Flynn Contacting Foreign Officials","The stock market lost over 350 points after ABC News erroneously reported that General Flynn was in communication with the Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during Trump s campaign. It turns out that after the stock market plunge and the feeding frenzy by the leftist media, ABC News got it wrong. Flynn was actually in contact with the Russian Ambassador during the Trump transition period, which is an entirely different story. In fact, according to a video that was uncovered by citizen journalist Jack Posobiec, Obama s State Department told reporters during the Trump transition period, that the State Department didn t have any problem with the transition team meeting with any foreign officials (See video below). According to CNN correspondent Jim Acosta, the Obama regime actually gave the  go-ahead  for Flynn to have conversations with the Russian Ambassador: On Friday, the White House said that it was the Obama administration that authorized former national security adviser Michael Flynn s contacts with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during President Trump s transition, according to CNN. Flynn pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Kislyak in the month before Trump took office, the first current or former Trump White House official brought down by special counsel Robert Mueller s investigation into Russian election meddling. Court records indicate that his communications with Kislyak were directed by a Trump transition official, with multiple news outlets reporting that official was Trump s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner.  They are saying here at the White House that Flynn s conversations with Sergey Kisylak were quote,  authorized  by the Obama administration,  CNN correspondent Jim Acosta said.General Michael Flynn released the statement below: After over 33 years of military service to our country, including nearly five years in combat away from my family, and then my decision to continue to serve the United States, it has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of  treason  and other outrageous acts.

"20 TIME DEPORTED MEXICAN Laughs While Being Sentenced For Sodomy, Kidnapping and Sexual Assault In SANCTUARY STATE of Oregon&Tells Victims Relatives: See All You Guys In Hell! [VIDEO]","Next time you see a Democrat lawmaker, thank them for supporting sanctuary cities and states, and making every American less safe A Mexican man who was deported from the US 20 times has been convicted of 10 counts including sexual assault in Oregon. On Friday, Sergio Jose Martinez, 31, was sentenced to 35 years in prison in a Portland courtroom after pleading guilty to kidnapping, sexual assault, sodomy and several other counts, KOIN reported.Martinez smiled throughout the trial, and as he left, he gave one grim parting shot to his two victims  relatives:  See all you guys in Hell. The first attack occurred early on the morning of July 24, when Martinez entered the Northeast Portland home of a 65-year-old woman through a window she had left open to cool the house.Wielding a metal rod, Martinez told the woman to get down on the ground, where he bound and blindfolded her, threatened to murder her, and then sexually assaulted her, KGW reported.He stole the woman s purse and car; she called the police from a neighbor s home, and they located the vehicle and put it under surveillance.While they kept an eye on the car, however, Martinez was stalking his second victim in a parking garage on the corner of Northeast 21st Avenue and Northeast Halsey Street.He approached her carrying a knife and made her get into her car; as he got in after her she attempted to escape, but he was able to grab her and start slamming her head into the ground.The woman called out for help and as passersby approached, Martinez attempted to steal her car, then fled on foot when it failed to start. Police caught him minutes later.Two relatives of one of the victims, and one of the victims herself spoke during the sentencing phase Friday, in which Martinez often grinned.A brother of one victim told Martinez:  Sergio, no sentencing is enough. I rather you rot in Hell. Deputy District Attorney Amity Girt, the prosecutor on the case, said:  We had some very powerful victim impact statements that said it all. It was really breathtaking to hear the far-reaching consequences of violent crime, the emotional injury. Under the agreement that spared Martinez a possibly longer sentence if he had been found guilty at trial, he pleaded guilty to 10 counts, including first-degree burglary, sodomy, sex abuse, kidnapping, robbery, and second-degree assault.Martinez s lawyer, Jonathan Sarre, said his client  suffers from some mental illnesses; often such people may do inappropriate things in these situations. However, he acknowledged that a doctor had declared Martinez competent to stand trial.Martinez had been freed from jail in Portland a week before the attacks; he was in there for interfering with police and providing a false birth date.He was released despite a request from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement for the Multnomah County Sheriff s Office to hold him so the agency could take him into custody.Oregon became America s first sanctuary state when it adopted a law in 1987 preventing law enforcement from detaining people who are in the United States illegally but have not broken other laws.

"WALMART Is Selling Made In Mexico Apparel Featuring Domestic Terror Group [VIDEO]","The domestic terror group, Antifa, has been around for a while, but since Donald Trump s inauguration in January, they ve become more visible and increasingly more violent. Well, good news for Americans who support violent, masked, molotov cocktail throwing, ax and hammer-wielding punks, who run through major cities in packs, busting out windows, setting fire to vehicles, and pretty much destroying anything or anyone in their path, as a way to show their  resistance  to a Donald Trump presidency, Walmart now offers a line of  Antifa  apparel for you. If you re struggling to find the perfect gift for your violent, snot-nosed, anti-Trump student, or unemployed basement dweller in your family this holiday season, you can find it online at Walmart. Walmart is selling  Antifa  clothing that  will [allow you to] express yourself inside the opposition to the ideology, organizations, governments, and people from the far right (fascism). The mega-retailer is offering at least 13 different sweatshirts  made in Mexico of 100% COTTON for all-day comfort  promoting the group whose activities were  formally classified  by the Obama Administration  as domestic terrorist violence  as early as April 2016, according to Politico, despite the group s efforts to downplay this determination. Antifa,  or Anti-Fascist Action, is an informal grouping of communist, anarchist, and other far-left street gangs. Drawing inspiration from the German Communist Party s street fighters of the 1930s, the modern movement grew out of the European far-left punk scene in the 1980s. These unapologetically violent bands of leftists were largely unknown in the United States until recent years, when America s post-Occupy Wall Street far-left began adopting the name.This (anti-Trump) video provides a window into the violent Antifa group and how they destroy other people s property while running from cops and calling for them to be killed. Listen to Antifa chanting:  AK47 put the cops in  piggy heaven  on the streets of Washington DC during Donald Trump s inauguration at about the 1:20-minute mark. Watch what happens to the young Trump supporter who tries to speak reasonably with the Antifa terrorists about how using violence is not the answer, as he puts out a fire started by the terror group at the 9:20-minute mark:Antifa is well known for dozens of violent crimes against people they consider  fascists  on both sides of the Atlantic. Just remember to keep creating a better world,  the clothing advertisements encourage.This glorification of Antifa was mirrored Friday by the New York Times, which published a fashion style guide for the group:  practical advice on how to dress for a riot.  In their guide, the Times explains why a uniform look is needed, from Breitbart News s Charlie Nash: These defensive methods work only if there are enough black-clad others nearby. A single person in all black and multiple face masks is an eye grabber. Finally, the Times claimed that dressing in black militant gear and concealing your face forms an  emotional connection  with other rioters. Tactical considerations aside, it s this emotional connection with other members of the bloc that many practitioners highlight the most in interviews,  they proclaimed.  It s why soldiers and police have uniforms. Walmart has come under previous criticism for selling  Black Lives Matter  shirts and other items. Following a request from the national Fraternal Order of Police, the retail giant eventually removed one of the items last December, shirts that said  Bulletproof,  but refused to remove the rest.As with the  Black Lives Matter  paraphernalia, the Antifa products are being sold by a third party manufacturer, in this case, Tee Bangers, on Walmart s website.

"FLASHBACK To 2014 WaPo Headline: Obama Should Fire John Brennan For Lying&Only One Year After James Clapper Was Caught Lying Under Oath","Yesterday, the leftist media spent the day wringing their hands in anticipation of finally pinning a Russian collusion story on President Trump, after General Flynn admitted to lying to the FBI about meeting with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, during the Trump transition period. It now appears that Flynn s testimony is a big nothingburger. In fact, if the media was being honest with the American people, they would be telling them that Flynn s admission doesn t hold a candle to the lies former President Barack Obama s regime was caught telling. Barack Obama s regime lied about matters that actually were much more serious in nature. Many of their lies were about covering up for the deaths of innocent Americans. From Obama s crooked former AG, Eric Holder, who lied about the illegal gun running program Fast n  Furious that was responsible for the death of US Border Agent BrianTerry, to the lies his former national security advisor, Susan Rice told, when she went on a media-blitz to knowingly lie, when she told Americans the death of 4 Americans in Benghazi, was caused by a video. It s got to be pretty bad, when a staunch Obama media ally, the Washington Post, tells him he should fire his CIA Director, John Brennan for lying.  From the Washington Post:In March, at the Council on Foreign Relations, CIA Director John Brennan was asked by NBC s Andrea Mitchell whether the CIA had illegally accessed Senate Intelligence Committee staff computers  to thwart an investigation by the committee into  the agency s past interrogation techniques. The accusation had been made earlier that day by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who said the CIA had  violated the separation-of-powers principles embodied in the United States Constitution.  Brennan answered:As far as the allegations of, you know, CIA hacking into, you know, Senate computers, nothing could be further from the truth. I mean, we wouldn t do that. I mean, that s   that s just beyond the   you know, the scope of reason in terms of what we would do. { }And, you know, when the facts come out on this, I think a lot of people who are claiming that there has been this tremendous sort of spying and monitoring and hacking will be proved wrong.Watch Brennan lie to Andrea Mitchell here:Now we know that the truth was far different. The Post s Greg Miller reports:CIA Director John O. Brennan has apologized to leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee after an agency investigation determined that its employees improperly searched computers used by committee staff to review classified files on interrogations of prisoners. { }A statement released by the CIA on Tuesday acknowledged that agency employees had searched areas of that computer network that were supposed to be accessible only to committee investigators. Agency employees were attempting to discover how congressional aides had obtained a secret CIA internal report on the interrogation program. Some employees acted in a manner inconsistent with the common understanding reached  between the CIA and lawmakers in 2009, when the committee investigation was launched, according to the agency statement, which cited a review by the CIA s inspector general. The CIA statement was first reported by McClatchy.That committee s investigation is said to be sharply critical of the CIA, finding that it exaggerated the effectiveness of harsh interrogation measures and repeatedly misled members of Congress and the executive branch. The findings are expected to be released publicly within weeks.After briefing committee leaders, Brennan  apologized to them for such actions by CIA officers as described in the [inspector general] report,  the agency statement said. Brennan also ordered the creation of an internal personnel board, led by former Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.), to review the agency employees  conduct and determine  potential disciplinary measures. An apology and an internal review board might suffice if this were Brennan or intelligence leaders  first offense, but the track record is far from spotless. In 2011, Brennan claimed that dozens of U.S. drone strikes on overseas targets had not killed a single civilian. This remarkable success rate was not only disputed at the time by news reports   even supporters of the drone program called it  absurd    but as the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and the New York Times both reported later, President Obama received reports from the very beginning of his presidency about drone strikes killing numerous civilians. As Obama s top counterterrorism adviser at the time, Brennan would have received these reports as well, so either Brennan knew that his claim was a lie, or he is secretly deaf. Similarly, Brennan denied snooping on Senate computers six weeks after Feinstein first made the accusation to the CIA in private, which means either that he was lying, or he had ignored a serious charge against his agency for six weeks, then spouted off about it without any real knowledge   hardly the behavior expected of an agency director.And last year, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper lied under oath to Congress when he told Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and the Senate Intelligence Committee that the National Security Agency did not collect any kind of data on millions of Americans, a claim later disproved by documents leaked by former NSA employee Edward Snowden. Despite Clapper receiving criticism from both sides of the aisle, the damage to Clapper s and the White House s credibility on intelligence and civil liberties issues and, well, the fact that lying to Congress is a crime (though one that s difficult to prosecute), Obama has not disciplined Clapper in any way.",politics,"Dec 2, 2017"

But no worries, several hours later, they  clarified  how the story should have read ABC News  major report on Michael Flynn and President Trump s direction on reaching out to the Russians has been corrected.

MediaiteABC News also tweeted out a clarification and deleted its earlier tweet:CLARIFICATION of ABC News Special Report: Flynn prepared to testify that President-elect Donald Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians *during the transition*   initially as a way to work together to fight ISIS in Syria, confidant now says. https://t.co/ewrkVZBTbc pic.twitter.com/GQAKwT1Eda  ABC News (@ABC) December 2, 2017Twitter users responded to the  clarification  by ABC News, who should NEVER have gotten this story wrong in the first place.

"WHY IS AL SHARPTONS Half-Brother Registering Thousands Of Felons To Vote In Alabamas Controversial Senate Race? [VIDEO]","Pastor Kenneth Sharpton Glasgow claims he s Reverend Al Sharpton s brother, and he s registering thousands of felons to vote in the hotly contested, upcoming Senate election. When the local News 5 station looked into the pastor s claim, that he was Al Sharpton s brother, they made an interesting discovery.  Glasgow told News 5 that he was indeed Al Sharpton s brother and that he dropped the  Sharpton  because  we didn t want somebody that s a racist, a bigot, to try to kill me knowing I was Sharpton s brother  while he was in prison. News 5  performed a background check on Glasgow and came up with nothing.  They also called Reverend Sharpton s office in New York and spoke with Sharpton s media correspondent, who said he d never heard of Kenneth Sharpton Glasgow. It wasn t until they contacted Sharpton-Glasgow s mother, Tina Glasgow, that they finally discovered the connection.As it turns out, Glasgow actually has ties to Al Sharpton Watch the video below for the bizarre details:Much like his brother, the  pastor  is also a Democrat activist, and he is pulling out all the stops to help the party defeat Judge Roy Moore, the Republican candidate for Senate in Alabama. While the Democrat Party is begging for donors to help support Moore s opponent, Doug Jones, Al Sharpton s half-brother is busy signing up felons to vote in a controversial election, where every vote will count.Thousands of felons across Alabama have registered to vote in recent weeks, according to Pastor Kenneth Glasgow, who is heading up a statewide effort to get felons to the voting booth.Glasgow s goal is to get as many felons as possible signed up to vote before the end of the day Monday, the deadline to be able to cast a ballot in Alabama s Dec. 12 U.S. Senate special election. In the last month, I think we registered at least five- to ten-thousand people all over the state,  Glasgow, president of Dothan s The Ordinary People Society (TOPS) advocacy group, said Monday.  I ve got people all over the state registering people with my TOPS branches in Tuscaloosa, Birmingham, Montgomery, Enterprise, Dothan, Abbeville, Geneva, Gordon, Bessemer, we have a lot. For generations, most Alabamians convicted of a felony were barred from ever voting in the state again, but the Definition of Moral Turpitude Act, a new law passed by the state Legislature and signed by Gov. Kay Ivey in May, cleared the way for thousands of felons to restore their voting rights.The law lists several dozen felony convictions that are considered crimes  of moral turpitude,  which means that anyone convicted of one of them loses the right to vote; other felons are now eligible to restore that right. Previously, the list of crimes that some registrars considered to be  of moral turpitude  was not clearly defined, and many felons simply believed they could never regain the franchise.

"ATTORNEY FOR STEINLE KILLER Calls Verdict Vindication of Rights of Immigrants [Video]","As if Americans aren t outraged enough about the verdict in the Kate Steinle murder, the lawyer for the illegal who murdered her came out and lectured Americans on the right of  immigrants This scumbag murderer is NOT an immigrant! He s an illegal alien who was deported 5 times! If San Francisco had followed federal law and detained this guy, Kate Steinle would be alive today! Attorney Ugarte speaks at the 1:00 mark after Ingraham s intro:Attorney Francisco Ugarte: I believe today is a vindication of the rights of immigrants. That today we have to reflect all of us on how we talked about this case in the beginning. And how this swarm of reflection and reaction on the basis of what I believe to be the racial dynamics of this case. Nothing about Garcia Zarate s ethnicity, nothing about his immigration status, nothing about the fact that he was born in Mexico had any relevance on what happened on July 1, 2015.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE STEINLE VERDICT: A shocking verdict and race baiting was on the menu tonight in the liberal bastion of San Francisco tonight The prosecutor in the Kate Steinle case won and then came out to make a statement where he attacked President Trump and waisted no time politicizing the verdict as it relates to gun control. He claimed that the president was  fomenting hate Huh?

"FOX NEWS Host EXPOSES Jimmy Kimmel HYPOCRISY After His Paid Goon Disrupts AL Church Service Where Roy Moore Spoke","If anyone thought the man who s been attacked by the left for most of his adult life, was going to roll over and play dead, as the Democrats and their allies in the entertainment industry come at him with a coordinated character assassination attempt, they were sadly mistaken.Breitbart   The U.S. Senate campaign of Judge Roy Moore is firing back at Jimmy Kimmel and his paid trickster Rich Barbieri also known as  Jake Byrd for disrupting a worship service at which Moore spoke here on Wednesday night. Jimmy Kimmel and the  Hollywood elite  cross the line when they invade our Churches under a disguise and attempt to make a mockery of our worship services,  Drew Messer, a senior adviser to Moore, told Breitbart News on Thursday morning after the incident at the church on Wednesday night.On Wednesday evening, after the pastor of Magnolia Springs Baptist Church here in Theodore, Alabama, just outside Mobile warned attendees of a worship service at which Moore was speaking multiple times that it was against the law in Alabama to disrupt worship services, Barbieri proceeded to interrupt the worship service during Moore s speech.The pastor had earlier in the evening also warned event-goers against disrupting the worship service, so this constituted his second warning. But that did not stop Barbieri whose character on Kimmel s show is  Jake Byrd from disrupting the event and being escorted out by police.

Based on the most recent ratings of late-night shows, the only thing keeping the higher rated late-night shows on the air is their unabated criticism of President Trump, that s used as fuel to keep their hate-filled, leftist audience fed.  Observer   While Donald Trump has been a huge boon for late-night TV ratings, one host who isn t enjoying an upswing is Jimmy Fallon. The good-natured nice guy persona Fallon has crafted on NBC s The Tonight Show is great for producing viral videos, but not so great for navigating a politically tumultuous era. As Stephen Colbert s The Late Show and Jimmy Kimmel s Jimmy Kimmel Live have continued to hone in on the Trump administration, and seen viewership rise as a result, Fallon has largely stayed out of the fray and is suffering because of it.According to the New York Times, Fallon has lost 21 percent of his audience year over year since the fall season began on September 25. Since February, Colbert leads late night in total viewers by a wide margin and Kimmel has been gaining ground over the last several months as well. NBC s top brass have combated these trends by noting that Fallon still leads the field in viewers in the advertiser-friendly 18 to 49 demographic, but the New York Times points out that even that gap is closing.Breitbart   Fellow senior Moore adviser Brett Doster bashed Kimmel for enabling Hollywood s culture of preying on women as seen by the recent downfalls of Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey. Last night, Jimmy Kimmel sent one of his goons to disrupt an Alabama worship service as a comedy prop,  Doster said in an email to Breitbart News.  For years, Kimmel hosted a show that exploited women and encouraged sexual impropriety. He and the rest of the entertainment industry look down their noses at our evangelical values while using their own pulpit to encourage the very behavior purveyed by monsters like Harvey Weinstein and Kevin Spacey. It remains to be seen whether Kimmel will have the guts to face Moore s team head-on in Alabama, and own up to the actions of his staff. A Kimmel publicist has not responded to Breitbart News when asked via email whether Kimmel or Barbieri would be willing to defend themselves in an interview.",politics,"Dec 1, 2017"

A brief statement released by Mueller s team Friday morning does not say what information Flynn has provided the government as part of this deal, but sources familiar with the agreement told ABC News Friday he has made a decision to assist investigators.THE DOCUMENT ACCUSING FLYNN:The document accusing Flynn of making false statements pertains to his interactions with Russian officials in late December   specifically discussions about sanctions and other matters.According to the document, those statements were that: On or about Dec 29, 2016, FLYNN did not ask the Government of Russia s Ambassador to the United States ( Russian Ambassador ) to refrain from escalating situation in response to sanctions that the United States had imposed against Russia that same day; and FLYNN did not recall the Russian Ambassador subsequently telling him that Russia had chosen to moderate its response to those sanctions as a result of his request; and   On or about December 22, 2016, FLYNN did not ask the Russian Ambassador to delay the vote on or defeat a pending United Nations Security Council resolution; and  that the Russian Ambassador subsequently never described to FLYNN Russia  response to his request.

He s use to 5-star places so we re betting he ll have the White House in 5-star shape AND under budget in no time .MAGA!Apparently, the White House really is a dump   with work orders showing reports of mice and cockroach infestations in the West Wing, broken toilet seats in the Oval Office and numerous other problems.The documents, obtained by NBC4 Washington, were made public this week just months after President Trump reportedly criticized the shape that it was left in by the previous administration. That White House is a real dump,  he said, according to Golf magazine.While the president later denied the comment, it turns out, there really are loads of issues plaguing the historic structure.White House officials made hundreds of requests for repairs, equipment and pest control in 2017 with the US General Services Administration   many of which were similar to those made in 2016 during Barack Obama s final year in office, NBC4 reports.The work orders were similar in number and included reports of mice, cockroaches and even ants!Some orders listed simple projects such as broken doors and chairs, while others detailed requests for TV systems and new decor. It s an enormous job. GSA is assigned to manage that job,  explained former GSA Inspector General Brian Miller.Some of the work that needs to be done inside the White House listed a mid-April deadline, though it s unclear if this was actually met. It s also not known if any of the aforementioned issues were ever fixed or dealt with. They are old buildings,  Miller said of the grounds at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

MSNBC host Craig Melvin repeatedly asked the congresswoman about sexual harassment allegations against Conyers, but Jackson Lee steadfastly refused to say her colleague should step down: I believe the decision to go or come will be the decision of that member,  she said.  As I understand it, Mr. Conyers is with his family. I m praying for them. I m praying for the women, and I m praying for them to make their decision.

Jackson Lee denied that was the case.NICE PIVOT BY LEE TO BLAST TRUMP BUT WE RE NOT BUYING IT: Craig, absolutely not, because the story is not near concluded,  she said before shifting to say what is  appalling  are the allegations against Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore and President Donald Trump.Melvin pressed Jackson Lee further on her position about the women who have come forward against Conyers, bringing up an African-American accuser who was on the  Today  show Thursday morning.

Horrible! Eight hundred,  says the auctioneer.  900   1,000   1,100   Sold. For 1,200 Libyan dinars   the equivalent of $800. Not a used car, a piece of land, or an item of furniture. Not  merchandise  at all, but two human beings.One of the unidentified men being sold in the grainy cell phone video obtained by CNN is Nigerian. He appears to be in his twenties and is wearing a pale shirt and sweatpants.He has been offered up for sale as one of a group of  big strong boys for farm work,  according to the auctioneer, who remains off camera. Only his hand   resting proprietorially on the man s shoulder is visible in the brief clip.  After seeing footage of this slave auction, CNN worked to verify its authenticity and traveled to Libya to investigate further.Carrying concealed cameras into a property outside the capital of Tripoli last month, we witness a dozen people go  under the hammer  in the space of six or seven minutes.   Does anybody need a digger? This is a digger, a big strong man, he ll dig,  the salesman, dressed in camouflage gear, says.  What am I bid, what am I bid?

And how did we get to this point? As the BBC reported back in May,  Libya has been beset by chaos since NATO-backed forces overthrew long-serving ruler Col. Moammar Gadhafi in October 2011. And who was behind that overthrow? None other than then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.You broke it, Hillary. You own it.Bush 43 had a deal with Gadhafi, according to which the dictator abandoned his weapons of mass destruction in return for not getting deposed. Obama and Hillary reneged on the deal, resulting in the creation of an ISIS/al Qaeda terrorist wonderland in a country that had been neutralized; a flood of largely unassimilable refugees into Europe; America becoming established in the international mind as untrustworthy, so that other dictators will be unlikely to follow Gadhafi s lead and give up nuclear/biological weapons programs peaceably; and black African slavery.On the positive side, it gave Hillary a chance to laugh merrily as she let loose with this zinger:Libyans importing slaves from south of the Sahara and the chaos in the Middle East is on Hillary.Via: moonbattery",politics,"Nov 30, 2017"

Conyers said her husband wasn t home and that she didn t know his whereabouts HERE S A GREAT EXAMPLE OF WHAT A NASTY WOMAN MONICA CONYERS IS: Watching this video will help anyone who is curious about why the city of Detroit continues to be bailed out of trouble like an irresponsible child with a trust fund. This video of Detroit City Council member Monica Conyers (D), wife of US Representative John Conyers helps to explain the type of character Detroit voters have been placing their trust in for decades. This is an older video, but definitely worth sharing.Shortly after this debate with an 8th grader, City Councilwoman Monica Conyers was found guilty of bribery and sent to prison for 3 years.Former Detroit City councilwoman, Monica Conyers was sentenced to more than three years in prison for bribery after a federal judge refused to set aside her guilty plea during a stormy court hearing dominated by a dispute over evidence of other payoffs.As guards cleared the packed courtroom, Monica Conyers yelled that she planned to appeal. The wife of U.S. Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., wanted to withdraw her guilty plea, suggesting she was the victim of  badgering  last year when she admitted taking cash to support a Houston company s sludge contract with the city.But U.S. District Judge Avern Cohn, reviewing a transcript of the June hearing, said Conyers had denied any coercion and voluntarily pleaded guilty to conspiracy.Conyers, 45, is the biggest catch so far in the FBI s wide-ranging investigation of corruption in Detroit city government. Nine people have pleaded guilty, including two former directors of the downtown convention center, and prosecutors have promised more charges are coming. Bribery is a betrayal of trust,  Cohn told Conyers after announcing a 37-month prison term for her  egregious  crime. She quit the council after pleading guilty in June.Conyers  plea deal was limited to taking bribes to support a contract with Synagro worth $47 million a year. But the recent trial of her former aide, Sam Riddle, exposed a series of alleged schemes involving others making payoffs to do business at city hall.Prosecutors said Riddle and Conyers collected $69,500 by shaking people down and urged Cohn to consider the alleged crimes when sentencing her. Defense lawyer Steve Fishman firmly objected and demanded a separate hearing.Conyers declared,  I m not going to jail for something I didn t do. Before the hearing, Conyers moved around the courtroom like a playful host, blowing kisses to supporters while wearing dark sunglasses. Her husband, who has an office in the federal courthouse, was not in the courtroom. Spokesman Jonathan Godfrey said he didn t know his whereabouts. Via: Huff PostDespite her going to prison, losing her political job and often embarrassing the family with her behavior in City Hall, U.S. Rep. John Conyers does not want a divorce from his feisty wife, Monica Conyers, his lawyer told the Free Press on Monday.The former Detroit city councilwoman filed for divorce last month, claiming the marriage has fallen apart beyond repair.

"DEMOCRAT SENATOR Reprimanded For Comparing Female Trump Nominee to a Horse: Its dehumanizing [Video]","A Democratic Senator tried to compare Trump nominee Kathleen Hartnett White to a horse during testimony before members of the Environment and Public Works Committee .Rhode Island Senator Sheldon Whitehouse tried to relate a story of Caligula s horse to the nominee but it went over like a lead balloon. We could start off by saying as a rule of thumb that a woman should never be compared to a horse Not a good idea. This arrogant and insensitive Senator thought  he would get away with demeaning Ms. White .Watch what happens when Senator Barrasso gets his two cents worth in The committee voted to confirm White s nomination to lead the White House s Council on Environmental Quality, Wednesday.Washington Free Beacon reports:During a business meeting prior to the party-line vote, Whitehouse likened White to the ancient Roman emperor Caligula s horse: There is a popular legend of the Emperor Caligula appointing his horse to the Roman Senate,  Whitehouse said.  Had he done that, it would have raised important questions, but the real questions would not have been about the horse. The horse was just a horse. The real questions would have been about the power of the Emperor Caligula and the spine of the Roman Senate. Discussing the merits of the horse would be pointless. Approving this nominee for CEQ would be so preposterous that it would be like appointing Caligula s horse, in that the real question becomes about the power of our fossil fuel emperors and the spine of the Senate,  he said.  This is a moment in which the Senate takes its own measure. I guess we re about to see the answer. Chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee Sen. John Barrasso (R., Wyo.) quickly condemned Whitehouse s remarks:  Let me just say that comparing Ms. White to a horse, as one of our Democrat colleagues just did, to me is a new low,  Barrasso said.

"NBC MANAGEMENT Protected The Sh*t Out of Him: Details of Married Matt Lauers Disgusting Acts Of Sexual Harassment Are REVEALED After Democrat Fan Boy Is Fired","NBC was called out by conservative news outlets, like Breitbart for refusing to disclose Matt Lauer s ties to the Clinton Foundation prior to his 30 minutes during NBC s  Commander-in-Chief forum  where he basically ignored every Hillary scandal during his interview with her. The longtime Today Show co-host had ties to the Clinton Foundation. Lauer was once listed as a  notable member  of The Clinton Global Initiative, the fundraising conduit of the scandal-ridden Clinton Foundation.Today, another close friend of the Clinton s saw his career as the highest paid morning host come to an abrupt end over sexual misconduct and assault allegations, as NBC announced that Matt Lauer had been fired from the Today Show.  Variety spoke with 10 past and present workers at the company who accused Lauer of a vast array of sexual misconduct, including the woman who claims that she was sexually assaulted by the show s long-time anchor beginning in 2014 at the Sochi Olympics.That woman also shared her account with the human resources and legal departments of NBC News on Monday.NBC launched an investigation into her claims on Tuesday morning which ultimately led to Lauer s firing that same evening. That swift response was still not enough for some women however, who said their complaints to executives at the company fell on deaf ears.Those interviewed said it was at the OIympic Games where Lauer made moves on a number of female staff members. Lauer would invite women employed by NBC late at night to his hotel room while covering the Olympics in various cities over the years,  claims Variety reporter Ramin Setoodeh. He later told colleagues how his wife had accompanied him to the London Olympics because she didn t trust him to travel alone.  None of the 10 individuals who spoke with Variety are identified in the piece, including the woman who got the sex toy along with  an explicit note about how he wanted to use it on her. That woman said she was  mortified,  while a fellow co-worker s state was described as  visibly shaken  after Lauer allegedly flashed her in his office.When she did not do anything, Lauer reportedly  reprimanded her for not engaging in a sexual act. His office was in a secluded space, and he had a button under his desk that allowed him to lock his door from the inside without getting up,  writes Setoodeh. This afforded him the assurance of privacy. It allowed him to welcome female employees and initiate inappropriate contact while knowing nobody could walk in on him. That information came courtesy of two of the women who spoke with the writer of the piece. He couldn t sleep around town with celebrities or on the road with random people because he s Matt Lauer and he s married. So he d have to do it within his stable, where he exerted power, and he knew people wouldn t ever complain. While not named, one woman, in particular, seemed to catch Lauer s eye according to thse interviewed for the piece. Several employees recall how he paid intense attention to a young woman on his staff that he found attractive, focusing intently on her career ambitions,  reads the story. And he asked the same producer to his hotel room to deliver him a pillow. Lauer s fixation on women s bodies and physical appearance is also a big part of the story, with multiple people saying that he would often play the game  F***, Marry or Kill  with staffers.One of the show s anchors would often gossip about Lauer s sexual escapades according to staffers while a former reporter said:  Management sucks there.

"TRUMP DEMANDS INVESTIGATION Into Accidental Death Of 28-Yr Old Joe Scarborough Staffer","With all of the stories of, TV hosts involved in sexual misconduct, it s a mystery why nobody brings ups the  accidental  death of Joe Scarborough s female staffer. Last November, President Trump called for an investigation into the death of Lori Klausutis, a 28-year-old staffer for then-Congressman Joe Scarborough. Many Morning Joe viewers probably have forgotten, or never knew, that the body of a female aide once was found in Scarborough s Congressional office. Investigators quickly saw that a blow to the head, delivered accidentally or intentionally, was involved in Lori Klausutis  death. There are also some serious questions as to the mental competency of the doctor who performed the autopsy, as well as an important question about why there was no time of death recorded on his autopsy.According to the Daily Kos: Joe Scarborough, a U.S. Congressman from Florida s 1st District from 1995 suddenly resigned only 5 months into his 4th term in September 2001. His reason? The classic  In order to spend more time with his children Curiously, just 2 months before he resigned, his 28-year-old staffer was found dead in his office.While Mainstream Media was hounding Democrat U.S. Congressman Gary Condit about his missing ex-intern, Chandra Levy, viewers heard next to nothing about Joe s intern, a healthy 28-year-old woman was found dead in his Congressional District Office in Fort Walton Beach, FL.Only two days after Scarborough s staffer was found dead in his office, the 9-11 terror attack happened, and this huge story was mostly ignored by media outlets. In a tweet calling for Scarborough and MSNBC president Phil Griffin to be terminated in the wake of Matt Lauer s firing, the president mentioned an  unsolved mystery  that took place in Florida years ago. So now that Matt Lauer is gone when will the Fake News practitioners at NBC be terminating the contract of Phil Griffin? And will they terminate low ratings Joe Scarborough based on the  unsolved mystery  that took place in Florida years ago? Investigate!  the president wrote to his 43.6 million followers.So now that Matt Lauer is gone when will the Fake News practitioners at NBC be terminating the contract of Phil Griffin? And will they terminate low ratings Joe Scarborough based on the  unsolved mystery  that took place in Florida years ago? Investigate!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 29, 2017Trump was referencing Lori Klausutis, 28-year-old office staffer who worked for Scarborough when he was a representative from Florida. Klausutis was found dead in the congressman s district office in July 2001.  The HillThe autopsy of Lori Klausutis makes no reference to a time of death. That raises new questions about an investigation that started when the 28-year-old woman s body was found in the office of then U.S. Representative Joe Scarborough in summer 2001.Accidental death was the official finding in the Klausutis case, with a cardiac arrhythmia causing her to fall and hit her head on a desk. But the recent discovery of human remains at a storage unit in Pensacola, Florida, casts doubt on that ruling. That s because the storage unit was rented by Dr. Michael Berkland, the man who conducted the Klausutis autopsy 11 years earlier.Berkland now faces a felony charge of improper storage of hazardous waste, and the grisly nature of the discovery calls his competence and perhaps his sanity into question.Daily Mail   Florida was not the only place Berkland ran into trouble over his work. In 1996, he was fired as a contract medical examiner in Jackson County, Missouri, in a dispute over his autopsy reports.Berkland had incorrectly stated on the reports that he had taken sections of several brains to be preserved as specimens for medical conferences and teaching purposes, AP reported.He claimed they were  proofreading errors  and the Missouri attorney general s office found they did not jeopardize any criminal cases.Berkland complained the actions against him were unfair because he was unable to present evidence in his defense. His doctor s license was ultimately revoked there. Independent blogger, Legal Schnauzer suggested in 2012 that Berkland s findings be dismissed and that his autopsy of the deceased staffer should not be trusted: Was the Lori Klausutis autopsy conducted in a professional manner? Was foul play prematurely ruled out? Should the investigation be reopened, perhaps with renewed scrutiny for Scarborough and others who might have had access to his office at the time?So it s hard to figure why the autopsy makes no reference to the time of death. (See full autopsy report here.)Why is that a key omission? Consider this from an online document titled  Determining Time of Death (TOD) :Why is it important to know the time of death?  TOD can set the time of murder  Eliminate or suggest suspects  Confirm or disprove alibisWhy did Berkland not include this critical detail? It s not as if his report does not provide plenty of other details. He tells us that Klausutis was wearing a white thong on the day of her death. (Page 7.) He tells us that she had a  shaved genital region.  (Page 8.) But no time of death?The core of the autopsy report can be found in the comment section, pages 3-7. This probably is the central finding:There is no doubt that the head injury is as a result of a fall, rather than a blow being delivered to the heading by a moving object. Lori has a classic  contrecoup  injury, or bruise to the brain, meaning that her brain was bruised on the opposite side from where the external force was applied. The left side of Lori s brain was bruised while the external abraded contusion (scratch and bruise) was in the right temple region. The contrecoup contusion results when a freely moving, mobile head strikes an unyielding, firm, fixed object in a fall, as in the floor, or in this case, the desk. This finding is in marked distinction from the  coup  contusion, or that injury which results from a moving object (example a ball bat) that strikes a stationary head. In the coup injury, there is bruising of the brain on the same side as the external injury. There was no coup contusion in Lori Klausutis.What would cause a seemingly healthy young woman, an avid runner, to collapse and lose consciousness, unable to break her fall? Berkland rules out some of the common causes of such an event a pulmonary embolus, a brain hemorrhage, a ruptured aneurysm, drug issues. He concludes:These facts leave only a cardiac arrhythmia as the reason to go unconscious and subsequently fall and strike the desk in an unprotected fashion. If Lori s heart was normal, it would be problematic to postulate a plausible reason for a cardiac arrhythmia in such a young person. However, her heart was not normal. The heart contained an abnormality (floppy mitral valve) that is known to result in cardiac ectopy and dangerous cardiac arrhythmias.All of this sounds reasonable. But given recent events, can Michael Berkland s work be trusted? Why on earth was he keeping body parts in a storage unit? And did any of those parts once belong to Lori Klausutis?According to the Daily Kos, Dr. Berkland and his supervisor at the time, Dr. Gary Cumberland were known to be high-giving donors to Scarborough s Congressional campaigns. Did their relationship with Scarborough influence any and all the results issued by the M.E. s Office?",politics,"Nov 29, 2017"

"YIKES! STUNNING VIDEOS Show ANYONE Can Hack MacOS High Sierra By Only Typing ONE WORD!","According to WIRED   THERE ARE HACKABLE security flaws in software. And then there are those that don t even require hacking at all just a knock on the door and asking to be let in. Apple s macOS High Sierra has the second kind.On Tuesday, security researchers disclosed a bug that allows anyone a blindingly easy method of breaking that operating system s security protections. Anyone who hits a prompt in High Sierra asking for a username and password before logging into a machine with multiple users, they can simply type  root  as a username, leave the password field blank, click  unlock  twice, and immediately gain full access.In other words, the bug allows any rogue user that gets the slightest foothold on a target computer to gain the deepest level of access to a computer, known as  root  privileges. Malware designed to exploit the trick could also fully install itself deep within the computer, no password required. We always see malware trying to escalate privileges and get root access,  says Patrick Wardle, a security researcher with Synack.  This is best, easiest way ever to get root, and Apple has handed it to them on a silver platter. As word of the security vulnerability rippled across Twitter and other social media, a few security researchers found they couldn t replicate the issue, but others captured and posted video demonstrations of the attack, like Wardle s GIF below, and another that shows security researcher Amit Serper logging into a logged-out account. WIRED also independently confirmed the bug.Watch these two incredible videos posted to Twitter letting Apple know they have a  HUGE  security issue at MacOS High Sierra:  pic.twitter.com/4TBh5NetIS  patrick wardle (@patrickwardle) November 28, 2017Just tested the apple root login bug. You can log in as root even after the machi was rebooted pic.twitter.com/fTHZ7nkcUp  Amit Serper (@0xAmit) November 28, 2017The fact that the attack could be used on a logged-out account raises the possibility that someone with physical access could exploit it just as easily as malware, points out Thomas Reed, an Apple-focused security researcher with MalwareBytes. They could, for instance, use the attack to gain root access to a logged-out machine, set a root password, and then regain access to a machine at any time.  Oooh, boy, this is a doozy,  says Reed.  So, if someone did this to a Mac sitting on a desk in an office, they could come back later and do whatever they wanted.

"JOY BEHAR Still Claims Clinton Won&BUT Wore Bizarre Mourning Item When Hillary Lost [Video]","The View s Joy Behar just let everyone know that she s a sore loser who just can t let go that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election. Even though she refuses to acknowledge Trump as president and says Hillary won, she told The View audience that she wore a black veil when Clinton lost indicating that she was in mourning. So which is it?She represents all of those on the left so well. She s STILL bitter and in denial over the loss. What a waste of time and energy to be part of the  resistance  to President Trump.She gets into it with  co-host Meghan McCain over it:   She did win and I m not going to give that up. The segment started with a  Hot Topics  discussion of Sen. John McCain s (R., Ariz.) interview with Esquire magazine where he trashed Clinton s post-election book. He sat down for an interview with Esquire, and he would like Hillary Clinton to hush. Because he says he felt it was a mistake for her to write a book so soon after she lost and that he learned after his loss the hardest thing to do is just shut up. Now, is he right?,  co-host Whoopi Goldberg asked her fellow hosts. With all due respect to your father and whom I like very much, I think he s wrong,  Behar said toward McCain.  I think a woman s place is in the resistance. The woman won the election. Behar s comment was met with audience applause and cheers. What I think I could get on board with if she wrote it and got it out but maybe waited to release it so it becomes more historical. Because I think the optics of looking at someone that s lost whether you agree with them, and I voted for her, or not it looks bad when you didn t win and you re talking,  co-host Sara Haines said. She did win,  Behar interjected.  She did win and I m not going to give that up. She didn t win,  McCain retorted. She won the popular vote,  co-host Sonny Hostin said.Behar continued to argue with McCain that Clinton won the election. But we don t elect presidents in America with the popular vote,  McCain said. I get that. But the numbers are still there,  Behar replied. Does that make you feel good at night when you re so angry about Trump, does that make you feel better?  McCain quipped. No, it doesn t,  Behar said.Behar then admitted she work a black veil when Trump beat Hillary.McCain recounted the night her father lost to President Barack Obama in 2008, expressing the extent to which she understands the difficulties of losing an election. Because you were up close and personal when your father didn t win the election,  Hostin said. And I ve been there on election nights for other candidates who have wanted it and it s deeply sad. On election night we prayed and my father told me to  buck up, we re the most blessed people in the world.  And then, we didn t complain about it. We as a family recognized President Obama as the phenomenon that he was,  McCain said.  Whether or not you like it, President Trump is a populist phenomenon in a completely different way. And I think if I were you, and I m part of the resistance, I would look forward to new leadership. ",politics,"Nov 28, 2017"
"GRAMMYS Nominate All-Black Artists&SNUB Country Music, White Musicians Over White Supremacy Concerns&#BoycottGrammys","On Tuesday, the Grammys announced their nominations for the 2018 awards shows, and there are some notable additions and snubs that make it look like the Recording Academy is getting into the business of identity politics.For the first time in 14 years, no country music acts were nominated for the top awards: record of the year, song of the year, and album of the year. Instead, the Grammys took a sharp turn towards honoring hip-hop, R&B, and funk for the top awards.According to Buzzfeed: The night s biggest category, Album of the Year, not only has majority black nominees, but also has no white male nominees for the first time in 19 years.This is also the first year the Record of the Year category is only people of color (with the exception of Justin Bieber, who is featured on Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee s  Despacito ).The Best New Artist category is also majority black this year with SZA, Khalid, and Lil Uzi Vert all gaining nominations. SZA is also this year s most Grammy-nominated woman.Rapper Jay-Z and pop singer Bruno Mars got nods in all three top categories, while rapper/singer Childish Gambino (a.k.a. Donald Glover), rapper Kendrick Lamar, and the coupling of Luis Fonsi & Daddy Yankee got nods in two of the top three categories. Meanwhile, rapper Logic got nominated for his anti-suicide song  1-800-273-8255  for song of the year.Objectively speaking, Jay-Z, Mars, Gambino, Lamar, Fonsi, and Yankee put out some great product this past year, and with any awards show, there are going to be some snubs. However, it appeared that Ed Sheeran, Lady Gaga, Pink, Kelly Clarkson, Kesha, and Miranda Lambert were all looked over from the top categories because of concerns about white supremacy. Instead, Lorde, the 20-year-old New Zealand singer, and Julia Michaels, the 24-year-old singer from Iowa, were the only pop acts to be nominated for the top categories.  Washington ExaminerSince rap seems to have surpassed country in popularity (well, at least according to the Grammys), in an effort to address  White supremacy , perhaps it s worth taking a look at the black rapper, Snoop Dogg, who shamelessly promotes killing our President and violence against his supporters. Paul Joseph Watson made a brilliant video that exposes how gangster rap increases racism in America.  racist 45-year-old rapper Snoop Dogg (**Language warning**): ",politics,"Nov 28, 2017"

"OOPS! DOCUMENTS SHOW Roy Moore Represented Accusers Mother In NASTY Custody Case, Where She Won Custody Of 12-Yr Old Grandson&Accuser Also Plead Guilty To FELONY FRAUD Charges Against Family Member","Court documents related to Tina Johnson, an Alabama woman who claims that Republican senatorial candidate Roy Moore groped her in his office decades ago, may raise questions about Johnson s motives in making the accusation.The documents, reviewed by Breitbart News, show that Moore represented Johnson s mother in a nasty custody case for Johnson s then 12-year-old son, Daniel Sitz. In the case, Johnson was repeatedly painted by Moore s client as an unfit, absent, and unstable mother and was accused of taking her son from his elementary school against his will. Johnson s mother was ultimately awarded custody in the case.One affidavit signed by Johnson s mother while she was represented by Moore accused Johnson of having a  violent nature  and noted that she  has been treated by a psychiatrist when she was approximately 15 years of age.  Johnson was a teenage mother.Separate criminal documents show that, as late as 2010, Johnson was arrested and pled guilty to felony fraud charges related to checks belonging to a family member. She also entered a court drug program.Speaking to AL.com, Johnson first went public with the claim that Moore groped her when she was  on legal business with her mother  in 1991. The website noted that  Johnson reached out to AL.com  to discuss her alleged experience with Moore.The website related that Johnson was  at the office to sign over custody of her 12-year-old son to her mother, with whom he d been living. Johnson claimed that, after the two met with Moore, her mother walked out of the office door first and that, as Johnson was walking out, Moore grabbed her buttocks from behind.  He didn t pinch it; he grabbed it,  she claims.Watch, as Tina Johnson tells CNN s Erin Burnett the  details  of her alleged sexual assault by Judge Roy Moore. It s curious that a woman with Johnson s background vs. the squeaky clean background of Judge Roy Moore would attempt to prove that her faith was stronger, or more somehow more relevant than Roy Moore s faith. A document, signed by Moore, stated that Cofield   and not Johnson   was the  most fit and proper person  to have custody of Daniel Sitz.Johnson s son had resided with his grandmother, Cofield, since he was nine months old. Cofield says that, during those years, she provided Daniel with food, clothing, and shelter  without any assistance  from Johnson. A judge officially granted Cofield full custody on September 23, 1991.Last week, Breitbart News interviewed Delbra Adams, Moore s former longtime secretary and judicial assistant. Adams said that, in her 13 years of working for Moore, she never saw or experienced any inappropriate conduct toward women.Adams worked for Moore in 1991 at the time of Johnson s accusations. Adams s desk was right outside his office door at the time. Adams  name was signed as a notary on one of the custody documents filed in Johnson s case on behalf of Johnson s mother, Cofield.

"DENZEL WASHINGTON Tells Black Americans To Stop blaming the prison system&It starts at home. It starts with how you raise your children","This isn t going to go over well with Obama s Black Lives Matter folks Veteran actor Denzel Washington says his latest role as a dogged defense attorney in Roman J. Israel, Esq. reinforced his belief that black men  can t blame the system  because we make it  easy work  when it comes to filling America s prisons. It starts at the home. It starts at home. It starts with how you raise your children. If a young man doesn t have a father figure, he ll go find a father figure,  the Academy Award-winner told reporters at the Dan Gilroy-directed film s New York premiere, the New York Daily News reports. So you know I can t blame the system. It s unfortunate that we make such easy work for them,  Washington said.The 62-year-old Hollywood heavyweight told reporters that the subject of how fatherless young men fall into a life of crime and incarceration is a personal one. I grew up with guys who did decades (in prison), and it had as much to do with their fathers not being in their lives as it did to do with any system,  said Washington, whose character finds himself working in the overburdened Los Angeles criminal court system.  Now I was doing just as much as they were, but they went further. I just didn t get caught, but they kept going down that road and then they were in the hands of the system,  the actor added.  But it s about the formative years. You re not born a criminal.   Breitbart News This isn t the first time Washington pushed back on the  victim  narrative for black Americans. The self-proclaimed radical feminist Jenn M. Jackson wrote a hit piece on Denzel Washington in December 2016. In her article, Jackson expresses concern that Denzel  is a little less woke than all of us had hoped.  She even suggests that instead of being honest about his thoughts on racism, Washington would have been better off keeping his mouth shut. LOL! From Jackson s hit piece on Washington: In a recent interview with BET, Washington was asked if he thought colorism (the discrimination against people with darker skin tones) was holding back darker-skinned Black actresses in Hollywood. As BGLH reports, Washington was initially confused about what colorism was, asking the interviewer, Smriti Mundhra,  what does that mean? Moments later he said, One of the best roles for a woman of any color in the last, in a good good while or at least any movie that I ve been in, a dark-skinned woman has in this film. So as long as you re being lead by outside forces or just being reactionary then you won t move forward. You have to continue to get better. However, he goes on to add,  You can say,  Oh I didn t get the part because they gave it to the light-skinned girl, or you can work, and one day, it might take twenty years, and you can be Viola. He continues, The easiest thing to do is to blame someone else, the system. Yeah, well, there s a possibility, maybe, that you re not good enough, but it s easy to say it s someone else s fault. But there s a possibility that you re not ready and you can still blame it on someone else instead of getting ready. ",politics,"Nov 27, 2017"

They are all bad. Winner to receive the FAKE NEWS TROPHY!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 27, 2017Is President Trump correct when he says the media has treated him unfairly? Well, an interesting study from the far-left leaning Harvard University, provided stunning evidence that proves President Trump is 100% correct:  Chicago Tribune  Harvard University s Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy has come out with a study of media coverage of the Trump White House in its first 100 days.It is astonishing because it comes from Harvard, not exactly the bedrock of American conservatism.The study found that in Trump s first 100 days in office, the tone of the news coverage of the president has been a whopping 80 percent negative to 20 percent positive.So what does fair and balanced really mean, anyway? It confirms what most people understand,  said Tom Bevan, publisher and co-founder of RealClearPolitics, one of the go-to websites for media and political junkies.Bevan spoke as a guest on  The Chicago Way  podcast that I co-host with WGN-AM radio producer Jeff Carlin. The response will be that Trump is deserving of this kind of coverage because he s conducted himself inappropriately, and these are self-inflicted wounds, and the press is doing nothing but covering him and his actions. But that s a little bit disingenuous,  Bevan said.So how was President Obama covered in his first 100 days? With a 60-40 positive to negative ratio, according to the Harvard study. That s a significant shift, a significant difference,  says Bevan.  I think this is reflective of the fact that the media does root from the press box and they do cheer for certain personalities and they do cheer against others. I have my own memory of the media s tone after Obama took office. It wasn t merely positive, it was adoring, gushy, in the way a small child looks up to a beloved parent, or a dog to the master who gives it biscuits.It was as if the media were hugging a magical unicorn. Obama wasn t only given the benefit of the doubt. He was handed the Nobel Peace Prize though he hadn t done anything to earn it. And critics were trashed as nothing but racists.Obama controversies, from his administration s gun running scandal in the  Fast and Furious  debacle to using the Internal Revenue Service as a weapon against conservative groups, were covered, somewhat. But generally, the tone was muted, respectful, nothing like it was for Trump or the Clintons.Later, in Hillary Clinton s failed 2016 campaign, leaks of Democratic National Committee email   whether hacked by the Russians or not   demonstrated collusion between journalists and Democrats. But that cozy relationship has never properly been addressed, and that avoidance undermines the credibility of journalism as the media challenges Trump. Because of the way the press covered Obama, they lost so much credibility,  Bevan said.  And because they did not take these things seriously, the IRS Scandal, Fast and Furious, you could go down the list of where they turned the other cheek.   And now where they re giving Trump the third degree on everything, that makes the contrast all that much greater. So you have a certain segment of the public, the people who voted for Trump, who literally do not trust what the media says. And the divide between rigidly defined political tribes, one courted by the media, the other dismissed by it, grows even wider. It s not good for journalism, and it s not good for the country,  said Bevan. ",politics,"Nov 27, 2017"

"NORWAYS TOUGH Immigration Minister BLASTS Sweden, WARNS Refugees: If You Are An Economic Migrant or an Illegal Immigrant Youll Be Sent Home","Norway has a new immigration sheriff in town, and so far, it appears that she s singing the same tune as President Trump on immigration. And oh yeah, Sylvi Listhaug  doesn t give a damn  about her critics either. How far are bleeding-heart nations, like Sweden, France, the UK, and Germany willing to take this mass-immigration experiment, before they realize it s too late to turn back? Before her appointment to the cabinet on December 16, Listhaug, then agriculture minister, criticized what she called a  tyranny of kindness that is blowing over Norwegian society like a nightmare. It is very serious that politicians are using punitive measures that would make it more difficult for a number of asylum seekers who are entitled to protection,  asylum association spokesman Andreas Furuseth told the Norwegian news agency NTB.Listhaug said she wanted 40 or so major and minor asylum law changes submitted to parliament in February before the European spring season, when asylum seeker arrivals were expected to rise again.She told Norwegian NRK public television that her legislative package amounted to a  sharp retrenchment  on wide social entitlements previously granted to refugees.Some 35,000 asylum seekers arrived in Norway in 2015.It was a record for the oil and gas-rich Nordic nation of 5.2 million people, which in recent weeks saw fewer arrivals, in part because of border controls reintroduced in neighboring Sweden and the arrival of wintry weather.NRK said the proposed rule tightening would allow family reunifications only after the applicant had acquired four years of work or education in Norway.And, the government would issue voucher cards instead of cash for day-to-day items to prevent applicants from sending money to family back home.Migrants who arrived on transit visas via Russia would not be granted asylum.Older applicants in the 55 to 67 age group would be required to learn the Norwegian language and aspects of Norwegian society.Applicants who fail to present identity documents will be refused asylum. A grant of temporary residence would not automatically lead to permanent residence.  DWWhen Angela Merkel invited refugees to Germany in 2015, tearing up the rules obliging migrants to seek asylum in the first country they arrive in, the consequences were pretty immediate. Over 160,000 went to Sweden, leading to well-publicised disruption. Next door, things were different. Norway took in just 30,000; this year it has accepted just 2,000 so far. To Sylvi Listhaug, the country s young immigration minister, this might still be a bit too much. We have a big challenge now to integrate those with permission to stay in Norway to make sure they respect Norwegian values,  she says.  Freedom to speak, to write, to believe or not to believe in a god, how to raise your children.  Also, she says, what not to do. For example:  It is not allowed to beat your children in Norway. It s unusual for a European government minister to link immigration with child-beating, but the 39-year-old Ms Listhaug is accustomed to speaking plainly. The rest of Europe, she believes, is coming around to the Norwegian position.After decades in opposition, her Progress Party entered government four years ago, a junior partner in a Conservative-run coalition. Her party envisaged the problems of mass migration in the 1980s, she says, so was well ahead of the populist upstarts now haunting so much of Europe.  A lot of them are socialist parties but against immigration. We are a libertarian party. We want less government, so people should decide more over their own life. And we want a stricter immigration policy because that s important for Norway in the long run. While Sweden and others saw the migration of 2015 as a blip caused by conflict in Syria and Iraq, she sees it as part of an irreversible demographic trend.  Africa is going to gain almost 500 million more people by 2030,  she says.  Much of the Middle East and Africa is fragile. People have difficult lives but can see via mobile phones that life in the West and in Europe is quite different. So I understand why they would like our life, our kind of standards. But it s not sustainable to integrate so many. Why not? Norway, with its oil-generated trillion-dollar sovereign wealth fund, is one of the world s richest countries   and hardly beset by integration issues. This, she says, is because they ve been careful.  Many of the jobs here today perhaps will not be here tomorrow. Working in supermarkets for example   those kinds of jobs that don t need higher education. Those who come to Norway without any education   what are they going to do in the future if this continues? The case for limiting economic migration is clear. But about half of the registered asylum seekers in the EU, last year were from countries that were struck by conflict. Can Norway justify taking so few? Ms. Listhaug is a practicing Christian (albeit skeptical of the  thoroughly socialist  Church of Norway) and says her government s immigration policy, when combined with its aid policy, is not just a moral response, but the most effective moral response. For me it s a moral issue as well. You can t just help the ones you see. You have to think about the millions you don t see and that have a very difficult life in the world. She s referring to the refugee camps in Jordan, where both Norway and the UK send aid to help those displaced by war. Norway gave  23 million to its Jordanian mission last year, almost twice as much, per capita, as Britain. The cost of helping refugees at home is taken from its foreign aid budget, so as its influx subsides and costs fall, all savings are used to help refugees abroad. Some  370 million has been transferred so far, with more expected next year.So to Ms. Listhaug, it s not a question of whether to help refugees, but how best to do so. We meet after she visited Brandon Lewis, her British counterpart, who gave her a striking statistic:  The immigration minister here in Britain said that for the price of helping 3,000 young people here, he could help 100,000 children in other parts of the world. She sees this as a modern way to help asylum seekers   and more practical than the 1951 UN Refugee Convention, which obliges signatories to accommodate anyone with a  well-founded fear of persecution . It was an agreement for its time,  she says.  But when people travel through 20 countries to come to a safe haven, I think people can see that this is not right. You could have a safe haven in your neighboring country, so why go so far? Western countries that define their virtue by the number of refugees they let in, she says, also face a moral question:  Why should we have a system that works for the people who have money [to pay for the journey] while the rest of the refugees and people in need don t have the money to go? People traffickers, she says, thrive on governments that follow the old rules and accept those who turn up on their shores.  If you smuggle an unaccompanied minor from Afghanistan to Europe, they say it is between $3,000 and $20,000.  Young girls, she says, are sometimes sold to old men to finance such a journey.  Also, children are killed, or raped, on their way. So we need to have this under control. Ms Listhaug provoked fury in Sweden a few weeks ago by visiting a suburb in Stockholm notorious for unrest among its young immigrant population. She called it a  no-go zone    a phrase that the Swedes angrily reject. But she doesn t seem to mind causing a fuss, especially as she thinks her critics are coming around to her way of thinking. Nor does she mind using Sweden as a case study in what not to do.  A lot of countries in Europe are thinking more like us: like Denmark and Austria. Germany, as well  France has big problems right now with integration, as does Belgium. A lot of countries in Europe see that we need to have this under control. The Norwegian model, she says, is very different and very clear.  If you are an economic migrant, you are declined in Norway,  she says.  We send people back to Afghanistan if they are not in need of protection; we send them back to Somalia if they are not in need of protection.  Isn t this a rather expensive process?  Yes, but it s well worth it.  Police are also sent out to areas where illegal immigrants are suspected of living and working.  If we find them, we send them out. That has also decreased crime in Norway, that s very good. I ask Listhaug if she is getting used to being called cruel and heartless. How does it make her feel? Her response comes quickly:  I don t give a damn,  she says. She thinks her approach is right, and the consensus is wrong. And, as she says, an increasing number of other countries think the same. A new consensus might well be in the making.  SpectatorUKSo what do her neighbors in Sweden think of her tough positions on asylum seekers? The Swedish resident in the video below has nothing but praise for Listhaug. He openly praises her while mocking the  lefties  who have allowed out-of-control migration to destroy much of Sweden. In the video below, he reminds Swedes of the startling crime statistics they are facing: In Sweden, we have 10 times more car torchings. Do you want this? We have 4 times more violent killings than Norway. Is that what you want? Well, you should listen to your lefties, and be more like Sweden, It s interesting, the migration minister Sylvi Listhaug, came to Sweden to find out for herself, she wanted to find out what not to do in Norway.

"BRITISH MUSICIAN Says If He Was Given The Chance, Hed Kill Donald Trump&Blames Press For Making Him President","If this so-called celebrity said that he would have killed former President Obama if he was given the chance, he would likely be sitting in a jail cell somewhere facing serious charges, but apparently when a celebrity says they d like to kill President Trump, foreign authorities, as well the leftist media, simply shrug their shoulders Just another day in the life of an unhinged, Trump-hating celebrity Yawn.British musician Morrissey says if given the chance, he d kill President Donald Trump to ensure the  safety of humanity.  The 58-year-old former Smiths frontman said in an interview with der Spiegel this week that if he were presented with a button that could instantly kill Trump, he wouldn t hesitate to press it. I would [push it], for the safety of humanity,  Morrissey told the outlet.  It has nothing to do with my personal opinion of his face or his family, but in the interest of humanity I would push. The singer also explained that it was the media, who so derided Trump during the 2016 campaign season, that ultimately created Trump, ensured consistent coverage of his campaign, and led to his victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.The American media helped Trump, yes, they first created it,  he explained, according to a translation of the interview by the Washington Times.  Whether they criticize him or laugh at him, he does not care, he just wants to see his picture and his name. The American media have shot themselves in the leg. Watch Morrissey push for a Hillary presidency on Larry King Now prior to the election. Is there anything more heartwarming than watching a British musician tell an American host who Americans should vote for? Thank goodness no one listens to this unhinged overrated celebrity.Morrissey added that he  never expected  Trump to be elected president and has  no faith  in the political establishment anymore.

"SOUTH KOREA Uses Hilarious Technique To TAUNT North Korea After Soldier Escapes Kim Jong Uns Hell [VIDEO]","There is no word yet, about how Rocket Man plans to respond to the egg on his face South Korea is making sure North Korea doesn t forget about the regime s soldier who defected to the South in a daring escape earlier this month   by blasting updates about the defector s health through its military s loudspeakers at the Demilitarized Zone, a report said on Sunday.South Korean troops broadcasted an update on Sunday about the North Korean soldier s  nutritive conditions,  taking a hit at the Hermit Kingdom s alleged health issues, Yonhap News Agency reported. The broadcasts are reportedly so loud that people within 12.4 miles from the DMZ are able to hear it. The nutritive conditions of the North Korean soldier who recently defected through the Panmunjom were unveiled,  an official told Yonhap News Agency.Consistent updates have been broadcast through South Korean military s loudspeakers since the soldier, identified by his surname, Oh, was shot at least five times while dashing across the Joint Security Area   a strip of land at the DMZ where North and South Korean forces stand face-to-face   on Nov. 13. The broadcast operation is part of an ongoing psychological warfare between the North and the South. The gigantic loudspeakers were switched back on in January 2016 after North Korea s fourth nuclear test.The loudspeakers are also reportedly used to blast propaganda to persuade North Korean soldiers to doubt Kim Jong Un s regime and even convince them to defect to the South, the BBC reported. Those speakers have been used sporadically since the end of the Korean War.Watch the North Korean s daring escape here:The 24-year-old North Korean defector is currently recovering from the gunshot wounds he endured when his fellow comrades fired dozens of rounds at him to stop him from defecting to the South. Video of Oh s dash to freedom released on Wednesday showed him speeding down a tree-lined road as stunned North Korean soldiers began running after him. He fell into a pile of leaves against a small wall before being dragged to safety by South Korean troops.   FOX News ",politics,"Nov 26, 2017"
"88-Yr Old DEMOCRAT Congressman and Accused SEXUAL PREDATOR Reluctantly Steps Down From House Judiciary Committee&REFUSES To Resign","John Conyers, the 88-year old Democrat Congressman and Black Caucus member who used taxpayer dollars from one of the most impoverished districts in Michigan, to pay off accusers of sexual assault, is refusing to give up the power he s become accustomed to, as the longest sitting House member in America s history. The corrupt Congressman has, however, agreed to step down from his role on the House Judiciary Committee, pending an investigation into the multiple allegations of sexual harassment that have been levied against him.In a statement released through Democratic Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi s office on Sunday, Conyers said he would like to keep his leadership position but realized that he may  undermine  the committee s work if he stays at the helm. I have come to believe that my presence as Ranking Member on the Committee would not serve these efforts while the Ethics Committee investigation is pending,  Conyers (D-Detroit) said in the statement.  I cannot in good conscience allow these charges to undermine my colleagues in the Democratic Caucus, and my friends on both sides of the aisle in the Judiciary Committee and the House of Representatives. Conyers, 88, is the longest-serving House member. BuzzFeed reported last week the contents of the secret $27,000 settlement Conyers paid with taxpayer funds to a former staffer who said she was fired for rejecting Conyers  sexual advances.Conyers has admitted to the payment but denied any wrongdoing. I deny these allegations, many of which were raised by documents reportedly paid for by a partisan alt-right blogger,  Conyers said, referring to the settlement papers obtained by Mike Cernovich and passed along to the news site.  I very much look forward to vindicating myself and my family before the House Committee on Ethics. With Conyers stepping aside, the next most senior Democrat   New York Rep. Jerrold Nadler   will become acting Ranking Member of the powerful committee. Even under these unfortunate circumstances, the important work of the Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee must move forward,  Nadler said in a Sunday statement.  I will do everything in my power to continue to press on the important issues facing our committee, including criminal justice reform, workplace equality, and holding the Trump Administration accountable. Nadler added:  Ranking Member Conyers has a 50 year legacy of advancing the cause of justice, and my job moving forward is to continue that critical work. New York Rep. Kathleen Rice was the first House Democrat last week to call for Conyers  resignation from Congress, and Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-Queens) said Conyers should at least give up his perch as the House Judiciary Committee s ranking member, pending the outcome of the ethics probe.Earlier Sunday, Pelosi defended Conyers on NBC s  Meet the Press  by not calling for his resignation and insisting the  icon  deserves due process.

Every white woman raises a detriment to society when they raise a son. Someone with the HIGHEST propensity to be a terrorist, rapist, racist, killer, and domestic violence all star. Historically every son you had should be sacrificed to the wolves b___,  the tweet read.An IU Health spokesman confirmed to FOX59 that Baker is a registered nurse, but declined to reveal the hospital where she is currently employed. IU Health is aware of several troubling posts on social media which appear to be from a recently hired IU Health employee,  the hospital said in a statement.  Our HR department continues to investigate the situation and the authenticity of the posts. During the investigation, that employee (who does not work at Riley Hospital for Children) will have no access to patient care. Baker claimed to work in pediatrics in previously deleted tweets.According to public records obtained by FOX59, Baker was most recently issued a nursing license on Oct. 30.The Twitter account behind the controversial messages, @tai_fieri, was originally deleted after the post sparked a firestorm, but now appears to have been created by a different user who is posting new tweets, the IndyStar reported.

"ANOTHER CLINTON CASUALTY? Sister Of Woman Who Allegedly Had Photos Proving Affair With Bill Clinton, Questions His Involvement In Her Mysterious House Fire Death","As more and more women line up to tell their stories about sex with Bill Clinton   both consensual and forced   there is one who is unable to relive the details of her alleged affair.Penthouse Pet Judi Gibbs died in a mysterious house fire in 1986 amid rumors that she had pictures that proved she and the then-Governor of Arkansas had been regular sex partners.And even now, 30 years after she died alongside her much-older other lover, doubts remain about how and why Gibbs and her long-time beau Bill Puterbaugh met their grizzly deaths.But now DailyMail.com has pieced together the life and death of Judi Gibbs, telling for the first time how the auburn-haired woman from a pin-prick of an Arkansas town managed to bed the man who went on to be one of the most powerful men in the world.And the question remains unanswered: Was Judi Gibbs killed because Bill Clinton and his advisers feared the affair was about to become public? I have always been convinced that Bill Clinton was responsible for the fire, but I have no proof,  Gibbs  older sister Martha, who still lives in Sims, Arkansas, told DailyMail.com.  And what would happen if I had proof   you can t touch those people. At the time of her death, Gibbs was 32 and living with 57-year-old developer Puterbaugh in a large isolated home a quarter-mile drive opposite a tiny airport outside Fordyce, Arkansas.Their bodies were both found in the huge master bedroom. They died of smoke inhalation.Puterbaugh s son, Randy, who followed him into the real estate business, tells a similar story to Martha Gibbs, even though the two have not spoken since the days following the double death. There are so many pieces of the puzzle.  Puterbaugh said.  I believe it is a possibility that Bill Clinton was involved in their deaths.  I know I wish I had hired my own private investigator but I didn t, so I guess I will never know. Judi Gibbs and Bill Puterbaugh died on January 3, 1986. According to a report in the local Fordyce News-Advocate, Gibbs called the fire department at 2.26 am wailing in her Marilyn Monroe-type voice:  Bill Puterbaugh s house is on fire, hurry, you all, hurry. Puterbaugh s body was found by a window. Gibbs was still clutching the phone right next to the king-sized bed.Local fire chief Roy Wayne Moseley has no explanation as to why the lovers did not manage to get out of the house. The only reason I can think why they didn t is they were overrun with smoke so quick and so fast,  he said. It was a real tragedy. As far as residential fires go, that was the worst we ve had,  added Moseley, now 80 and still chief of the Fordyce Volunteer Fire Department   a post he has held since 1960.Many people around the Clintons have died in unusual circumstances over the years, leading conspiracy theorists to claim they could be connected.As DailyMail.com reported earlier this year, five deaths in a six-week span between June 22 and August 2 this year had connections to the former first family. I m not saying the Clintons kill people. I m saying a lot of people around the Clintons turn up dead,  Larry Nichols, who worked with the former First Family before turning against them, told DailyMail.com.And the names of Judi Gibbs and her lover Bill Puterbaugh could be added to that list.Gibbs was the sixth of seven children born to a hardscrabble family in Sims, a two-hour drive west of Little Rock.In her teens, she was lured into prostitution by her brother-in-law Dale Bliss, who is now 85 and 32 years into a life prison sentence for child rape.

"TEACHER Uses Shooting at Trump As An Option On Multiple Choice Quiz For High School Students","A Wyoming high school is under fire after parents exposed an online student quiz that offered  shooting at Trump  as one of the multiple choice answers.An unidentified English teacher at Jackson Hole High School gave students a multiple choice quiz on Thursday about George Orwell s novel  Animal Farm  that included a question that many are pointing to as an example of the district s  liberal bias,  the Jackson Hole News and Guide reports. Napoleon has a gun fired for a new occasion. What is the new occasion?  the quiz read.Possible answers included  He was shooting at Trump,   His birthday,   For completion of the windmill,  or  To scare off the attackers of Animal Farm. Jim McCollum told the news site he did a double-take when his son showed him a screenshot he took of the test. I had to read it two times,  McCollum said.  I was like,  Are you kidding me? McCollum, a Jackson Hole High School graduate and Trump supporter, shared the quiz on Facebook, where it was shared widely and generated a lot of angry comments. It was so inappropriate to show a name of a sitting president in that question,  he said.  To me, that is so wrong in light of the situation in our country and the divisiveness and all. He told the news site the incident is one of other examples of  liberal bias  in other classes at the school that make conservative students like son out to be  the outcast. He told me,  Dad, they crapped on everything I believe in,  McCollum said of his son.  Rylee is very patriotic, very supportive of our military and of our country  and is considering enlisting in the U.S. Marines.School officials eventually issued a statement about the quiz on Monday. (District) administration learned late yesterday that a quiz was administered to a class of high school students that contained an inappropriate answer to a multiple choice question. The administration is investigating this incident and verifying the information we have received,  the statement read. (The District) takes seriously threats of any kind, regardless of the intent.

"I SERVED WITH ROY MOORE IN VIETNAM&Letter From Veteran Sets Record Straight On Honorable, Decent, Respectable, Patriotic Commander and Soldier","If it wasn t for people like Vietnam veteran William E. Staehle, who made the decision to publicly defend the character of Roy Moore in an op-ed, the only picture the American people might have of the former judge, is the one painted by the leftist media and the rabid Democrat Party, that struggles to identify a single legitimate reason for Alabama voters to  support their candidate Doug Jones.I served with Roy Moore in Vietnam in 1971-72, where I knew him to be an altogether honorable, decent, respectable, and patriotic commander and soldier. I have had no contact with him since.He and I were captains and company commanders in the 504th Military Police Battalion, stationed at the base camp called Camp Land, just west of Danang.I knew him well in my first four months in-country before I was re-assigned within the battalion to another location. During that time, I grew to admire him.I am Bill Staehle, residing in Asbury Park, New Jersey. I am an attorney, practicing law continuously for 42-years. I began my career as an assistant United States attorney, and for the past 32 years, I have been the managing trial lawyer for the staff counsel office of a major insurance company.Allow me to relate to you one experience involving Roy that impressed me.While in Vietnam, there came a time when another officer invited Roy and me to go with him into town after duty hours for a couple of beers. That officer had just returned from an assignment in Quang Tri Province north of Danang, and we were interested to learn of his experiences.I had not met him before, and I don t believe Roy had either. On other occasions with other officers, we would go to the officers  club at the air force base, but on this occasion, he told us he knew of another place in town.When we arrived at the place and went inside, it was clear to Roy and me that he had taken us to a brothel. That officer appeared to know people there, as he was greeted by one or two young women in provocative attire.The place was plush. There were other American servicemen there. Alcohol was being served. There were plenty of very attractive young women clearly eager for an intimate time.In less time than it took any of the women to approach us, Roy turned to me and said words to this effect,  We shouldn t be here. I am leaving. We told the officer who had brought us that we wanted to leave. He told us to take his jeep and that he could get a ride back later, which he did. Roy and I drove back to camp together.That evening, if I didn t know it before, I knew then that with Roy Moore I was in the company of a man of great self-control, discipline, honor, and integrity. While there were other actions by Roy that reinforced my belief in him, that was the most telling.I reject what are obvious, politically motivated allegations against Roy of inappropriate dating behavior. What I saw, felt and knew about him in Vietnam stands in stark contrast to those allegations.I sincerely doubt that Roy s character had changed fundamentally and dramatically in a few short years later. He deserves, in my view, to be heard on the issues that are important to the people of Alabama and our country.Roy was a soldier for whom I was willing to put my life on the line in Vietnam if the occasion ever arose. Fortunately, it did not.I was prepared to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with him then, and I am proud to stand by Roy now.  William E.

"WATCH: ABUSIVE, TRUMP-HATING Student May Be Facing Jail Time, After STEALING Trump Hat Off Students Head and DEMANDING College Officials Prevent Him From Wearing It On Campus","On September 27, 2017, an unhinged, liberal, Trump-hating student, who has now been identified as Edith Macias, was captured on what has now become a viral video. In the video, Macias can be seen ranting and screaming, during an unbelievable exchange that took place in a campus office building at the University of California, Riverside, only moments after she stole a hat off  the head of Matthew Vitale, a UC Riverside student who was walking on the campus, and minding his own business. The exchange between this Hispanic woman, (who we re pretty sure is not a legal citizen, based on her comment to the victim, when she screamed,  F*ck your laws!  after he cited his right to free-speech) and the victim is stunning. Over and over again, this ill-informed and unbelievably angry student makes up her own facts with absolutely no basis whatsoever. Saying things like the signature Trump hat that reads  Make America Great Again  represents  the genocide of a bunch of people  and  America was never great  and of but of course,  You stole this land!  Just another ungrateful immigrant who is likely one of Obama s  Dreamers. ***WARNING*** The video below will make your blood boil.According to Campus Reform, here s how the unbelievable exchange went down:A Trump-supporting student at the University of California, Riverside had his MAGA hat stolen by a peer who demanded that administrators refuse to allow him to continue to wear it.A video of the incident obtained by Campus Reform shows an enraged female student taking the hat to the school s Student Life Department as Matthew Vitale fruitlessly attempts to explain to the young woman that the hat is his property. I swear to God I could burn this sh*t. I swear to God I could burn this sh*t,  she continues as several staffers look on. Are you people not going to do anything? She is stealing my property,  Vitale pleads, though the altercation went on for several more minutes. We will need to return his property to him, but we can talk about  one university employee begins to explain before being abruptly cut off by the student thief. How about we talk about not letting him wear this sh*t on campus?  the thief retorts, while Vitale later tells a growing presence of administrators that  the fact that you people haven t gotten this back for me is sad and wrong. The altercation continued for several minutes until the hat was relinquished to an administrator who then returned it to Vitale, though not before his fellow student got in the last word. F*** your f***ing freedom of speech, boy. F***it. F*** it because your freedom of speech is literally killing a lot of people out there.According to the College Fix: The UC Riverside student who stole Vitale s Make America Great Again hat off his head and refused to give it back now faces steep legal consequences.A criminal complaint provided to The College Fix by the Riverside County District Attorney s Office states that Edith Macias has been charged with one misdemeanor count of grand theft for the September 27 incident.The next court date on the matter is slated for March, and the maximum penalty Macias faces if convicted as currently charged is one year in county jail, a spokesman for the DA s office told The Fix.The charge was filed after UC Riverside student Matthew Vitale, the student who had his Make America Great Again hat stolen from off his head, decided to press criminal theft charges against Macias.According to the declaration in support of an arrest warrant, Macias told the officer who responded to the incident that the reason she swiped the hat was because it represented  genocide of a bunch of people. She stated she wanted to burn the hat because of what it represented,  it states.In a statement to The College Fix on Monday, Vitale said he is gratified by the developments. I m very pleased that the DA decided to charge her, especially because I am skeptical that UCR student conduct did anything. I will be following up with the student conduct office to determine if anything was done,  Vitale said. In the meantime, I can t thank UCPD enough for actually taking this matter seriously. The detective and officers involved with this case were the epitome of professionalism,  he added.  If, as I suspect, UCR decided not to discipline her in some way this decision by the DA s office shows two things: First, that UCR does not protect and shows no respect for speech that does not conform to their ideology. Second, that, in this case, UCR chose not to discipline a person who committed a crime on campus against another student. After Vitale had requested charges be brought against Macias, he explained his motives to The College Fix:  I do want to send a message. I am not vindictive, I am not vengeful, but people, especially in my generation, need to realize you can t do things like this because you don t like what someone is saying or wearing. Knock, knock.Who s there?Karma ",politics,"Nov 24, 2017"
"ARMY VETERANS Incredible Thanksgiving Smack Down Of Spoiled Brat NFL Anthem Kneelers Goes Viral","On this Thanksgiving, I would like to address an open letter to the multimillionaire National Football League players who continue to take a knee when  The Star-Spangled Banner  is played.Dear kneeling brothers,As a proud Army veteran, mom and black American, I thank God that I live in the greatest nation on Earth. For me, Thanksgiving doesn t just come once a year. I m thankful 365 days a year.You make far, far more money than almost all Americans   regardless of race. Kids look up to you as heroes. You appear on TV and in the media.Yet, you keep on protesting   refusing to rise and respect our national anthem and respect the men and women like me who serve or have served in our military.I was willing to die for my country when I put on the Army uniform. And you re not even willing to stand up for a short song? This is too much of a sacrifice for you?One of the many lessons I ve learned along the way is that there is no place on the planet like America. She is not perfect, because we are not perfect. Yet, she is a consummate beacon of light, set upon a hill, for nations who look to her for hope, dignity and direction.You big guys should appreciate that   and pause for a few moments to express your patriotism and love for our great nation when our national anthem is played and our flag flies before thousands of people who have paid good money to see you run around a field chasing a little ball.Let me tell you about me. I m not as big and strong as you, but I stepped forward to join the Army to fight for your right to play games in peace.Weeks before I graduated from the Army s basic training program, I had an epiphany: I could be deployed to war. Would I go? Would I put my life on the line for someone else?It didn t take me long to come to a resounding Yes! If called, I would go.But I gave myself an assignment. If I was going to potentially give life or limb to defend this great country, I would need to know what, exactly, I was defending. I am still learning.One of the lessons I ve learned about America is more of a personal lesson. I am not a victim. My two beautiful black babies are not victims. Black Americans are not victims.We are victors   not so much because of anything we have done, but because of those who came before us. Slaves in chains, treated like farm animals, to be  owned  by others. And after Emancipation, those who endured the humiliation of drinking out of the  dirty  water fountain or taking their child into the  colored  restroom.Those who were spat upon or cursed out solely because they were deemed the  wrong  color. Those who had to guess the number of jelly beans in a jar to be eligible to vote, notwithstanding their college education.Those who were hosed down, billy-clubbed across the head or attacked by trained dogs just because they walked across a bridge.Those who were aroused from their sleep to see hate-filled men covered in white sheets, a cross burning in their front yard and their neighbor calling out for their son.Those who, oftentimes, paid the ultimate sacrifice   not for their own benefit, but for the joy that was set before them.We, today, are the joy that was set before them. And, how do you repay them for their sacrifice to be treated as equal under the law? You have chosen to take a knee.If you followed the rhetoric we hear today, America is not far removed from those Jim Crow days of legalized discrimination against black people.If you closed your eyes and just listened to the blistering speeches coming from Antifa, the Black Lives Matter folks and many politicians, you would think we re not even 40 years removed from slavery itself.The narrative behind  Hands Up, Don t Shoot  perpetuates the storyline that around every street corner there s a police officer waiting to shoot a black man. It is these narratives that have given life to you NFL players kneeling during our national anthem.If there was truth behind these narratives, then I would readily support you black millionaire athletes using your national platform to shine a bright light on the systemic racism against the black community.But we re not living in 1850 or 1950. Racism is certainly not dead, but it s not the powerful monster backed by all the resources of government either. And you guys are not exactly downtrodden, going hungry, being shoved to the back of the bus, or used for target practice by Ku Klux Klansmen dressed up like cops.Allow me to make a few suggestions to you as an alternative to continuing to disrespect our country and flag. If you want to make a real difference that extends beyond getting your picture on a magazine cover, please consider doing the following.First, invest in black urban schools, to help them pay for the educational programs and enhanced learning opportunities that wealthy suburban schools have to help their students succeed.Second, commit to providing mentoring and college scholarships for 20, 10 or even just one child in the inner city, from elementary school through high school and into college. You will change their futures.Third, take $1 million or $2 million   not all of your vast wealth   and invest it into creating jobs, businesses and entrepreneurial internships to help black people achieve the American Dream. Find ways to personally take your millions directly into a distressed community and invest.Fourth, take a family out of the inner city by giving them a mortgage-free home. Consider the ripple effect of good this stand would have on the lives of an entire family for generations to come.Fifth, educate yourselves and then others on what the Democratic Party has done to the black community. I have yet to find an inner city run by conservatives. Yet I see one Democratic politician after another representing some of the most distressed communities. These politicians themselves usually do not live in those distressed communities and often live in expensive homes while their kids attend private schools.Teach yourselves and others to hold elected officials accountable. Be determined to no longer fall prey to their sleight-of-hand manipulations that only serve to distract you from their lack of effort to make real changes in the black community.Doing just one of these things would make an indelible imprint on any community, especially the black community.So instead of taking a knee, take a stand to stomp out poverty by investing in businesses, by creating an environment that promotes family stability, and by fanning the flames of hope, dignity and direction into the lives of some of our most depressed citizens.By the grace of God, I was never called into war during my Army service. I know many others who were. Some did not return whole. So, while I can t play pro football, I have two legs, two arms and a brain that tells me to appreciate and love the United States of America.For all this I am thankful, and I think you should be too.Happy Thanksgiving,Kathy Barnette",politics,"Nov 23, 2017"

"DRAMATIC VIDEO RELEASED: Brave Soldier Tries Escaping North Korea Under Gunfire [Video]","The American-led UN Command just released very dramatic video showing a North Korean soldier trying to escape across the border into South Korea. The tricky thing is that four soldiers were firing on him the entire time The video starts with a lone soldier driving a dark olive-green jeep  down a straight, tree-lined road, past drab, barren fields and, headlights shining, across the replacement for the Bridge of No Return, which was used for prisoner exchanges during the Korean War,  the Associated Press reported.Fellow North Korean soldiers realize that one of their comrades is trying to defect to South Korea and start chasing the jeep through the Korean Demilitarized Zone, or DMV, until the defector crashes and exits the vehicle under fire. He then sprints across the border before hitting the ground in critical condition but alive.The four soldiers unloaded an estimated 40 rounds from multiple types of firearms.The defector a 24-year-old soldier surnamed Oh, according to CNN was taken to a South Korean hospital in critical condition from the gunshot wounds and lost nearly half of his blood. Oh s surgeon, Lee Cook-jong, said that he found four major wounds on the soldier, who received four pints of blood.The soldier underwent multiple surgeries to repair damage, and in doing so, surgeons found dozens of parasites including a 10.6-inch roundworm, possibly indicating improper nutrition in North Korea s military. His condition has become much better since yesterday. We ve turned on the TV for him since yesterday,  Lee told reporters.Read more: WFB",politics,"Nov 22, 2017"
"FED UP FAN Confronts College Basketball Player For Shooting Baskets During National Anthem Because Of His Islamic Faith&Gets Standing Ovation From Crowd","Has America reached a tipping point? Will more and more fed up Americans begin to object to athletes who choose to blatantly disrespect our flag during the national anthem? Should athletes be allowed to disrespect our flag during school-sponsored events? We d love to hear what you think in the comment section below.Todd Starnes of FOX News broke the story about 74-year old Jim Howard, of Garden City, Kansas is a red-blooded, American patriot and a faithful supporter of the athletic program at the local community college.For 32 years he s volunteered with the booster club   keeping scorebooks, holding fundraisers, running the chain gang for football   and even providing a place for players to have a Thanksgiving meal.He was in the stands on Nov. 1 for the season-opener of the Garden City Broncbusters basketball team. And when the announcer asked everyone to stand for the national anthem, he dutifully joined the crowd and stood at attention.That s when he noticed a lone player seated on a bench at courtside   Rasool Samir, a 19-year-old Muslim red-shirt.It was unusual because there s a team rule that the entire basketball team was supposed to stay inside the locker room until after the national anthem had concluded.But as the crowd began singing about the bombs bursting in air and the rocket s red glare, the Muslim basketball player grabbed a ball, walked onto the court and began shooting baskets. It was an  in your face slam,  he said.Mr. Howard decided enough was enough. He was tired of people disrespecting the national anthem. So at the conclusion of the song, he walked onto the court and confronted Samir. I walked onto the floor and I told the guy he should respect the flag and if he s not going to respect the flag, he should get off the court and get out of the gym,  Mr. Howard told the Todd Starnes Show. You should respect the flag. If you don t respect the flag, just stay seated. Don t make a big scene,  he said.  At least respect the people that paid for your scholarship to get you on this campus   like myself and everyone else in that gym. The Garden City Telegram reported that a police officer broke up the confrontation   telling Mr. Howard to return to his seat and escorting the player off the court.When that happened, a number of people in the stands gave Mr. Howard a standing ovation and some fans even came over to shake the man s hand.It seems, they too   had had enough. Everyone around town was patting me on my back and saying thank you,  he said.The following day Samir was dismissed from the team.However, there are two versions as to what happened. The local newspaper says it was Samir s decision to leave. But the American Civil Liberties Union claims the young man was kicked off the team.The Kansas chapter of the ACLU fired off a letter to the community college demanding answers and claiming that Samir s constitutional rights were violated. He refrained from participating in the national anthem because he is a Muslim and his faith prohibits acts of reverence to anything but God,  the ACLU wrote in a letter to the school.Well, if that s the case, why didn t Samir stay inside the locker room with the rest of the team during the national anthem?

"JUST IN: THREE LIBERAL REPORTERS Bribed To Push Trump Dossier Propaganda"," It s no wonder that Fusion GPS wants to block documents from coming out. The newest unsealed documents are explosive enough with the revelation that there was a payoff to three reporters to push negative news on Trump. Who are the three journalists? Well, Fusion GPS wants that to remain a secret Unsealed court documents reveal that the firm behind the salacious 34-page Trump-Russia Dossier, Fusion GPS, was paid $523,000 by a Russian businessman convicted of tax fraud and money laundering, whose lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya, was a key figure in the infamous June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower arranged by Fusion GPS associate Rob Goldstone.In short, D.C. opposition research firm Fusion GPS is the common denominator linked to two schemes used to damage the Trump campaign.PAYOFF TO THREE JOURNALISTS:Newly filed court documents confirm that Fusion GPS, the company mostly responsible for the controversial  Trump dossier  on presidential candidate Donald Trump, made payments to three journalists between June 2016 until February 2017.The revelation could be a breakthrough for House Republicans, who are exploring whether Fusion GPS used the dossier, which was later criticized for having inaccurate information on Trump, to feed anti-Trump stories to the press during and after the presidential campaign. The three journalists who were paid by Fusion GPS are known to have reported on  Russia issues relevant to [the committee s] investigation,  the House Intelligence Committee said in a court filing.REDACTED DOCUMENTS AND RESTRAINING ORDERS:But the recipients  names, the amounts, and purposes of those payments were either redacted from the documents that Fusion GPS filed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or were not disclosed.Fusion has asked the court to issue a restraining order against the House committee, which is demanding documents from the company that, among other things, explain the payments it made to reporters. Most of the documents sought are banking records.Let s hope that the details come to light and all are held accountable for their corruption.",politics,"Nov 22, 2017"
"LOL! NYC COLLEGE Tells NYPD To Use Bathroom At Far End Of Campus With Dirty and Broken Toilet So They Dont Offend Students","Brooklyn College is advising New York City police officers to use bathrooms on the far end of campus in order to avoid being seen by students who might be offended by their presence.The Excelsior, the college s student newspaper, reported last week that Director of Public Safety Donald Wenz would  prefer  if members of the New York Police Department (NYPD) used facilities in the West End Building (WEB)  rather than walking across either quad to use the bathroom. Wenz s comments come in the wake of a film screening of the movie  Watched,  which documents an NYPD informant who surveilled Muslim students on campus for a period of four years as part of the city s counterterrorism efforts. After the screening, students were allowed to share their thoughts on having NYPD officers on campus. I disagree with them being on campus. Especially allowing them to use the building where student groups are held,  one unidentified student remarked, according to The Excelsior, later noting that he would be sending a petition to College President Michelle Anderson, pressuring her to issue a statement  that we do not want the NYPD on campus in any respect even if it s just to take breaks and use bathrooms. After discovering The Excelsior s report, The New York Post took a trip to the WEB, where officers are now encouraged to use the bathroom, and found an  out of order  sign on the stall door, with a dirty and broken toilet on the inside. The bathroom is horrendous. You can only wash your hands in one of the sinks because the other two are broken,  one student told the Post, though others argued that NYPD should not be allowed on campus at all. I know students from every background and across every major. They don t feel comfortable around cops. They just don t. It makes safe spaces feel not so safe,  one unidentified student remarked, with another telling the Post that it s  weird  seeing cops on campus.But members of the NYPD who monitor the neighborhood surrounding the school told the Post that the student sentiments are  insane.

"WOW! NASTY LIBERALS ATTACK 9-Year Old Girl After Video Showing Her Getting Excited To See Donald Trump Goes Viral& I will punch that lil girl in ha face","The Washington Post published an article with a video of 9-year old Ava Lovley of Newport, Maine, in the back seat of the family car, that captured her reaction when her mother, Kim, told her that they were going to a Donald Trump rally in January, 2016. We re Republicans, but we re not political people at all,  Kim Lovley told us by phone when we spoke on Tuesday afternoon. Ava was a big Trump fan, though, and had been tracking his candidacy since he announced.  She said she loved his hair and that he speaks his mind,  Kim said. And since Ava herself is a bit outspoken, that appealed.Kim arranged for the family to see Trump at an event in Farmington, N.H., about three miles from Newport, just over the state line.  When I put [the video] on Facebook, basically it was just for our friends and family to see how happy she was,  Kim said.  It wasn t for any political agenda.  When a friend helped her upload the video to YouTube, though, it blew up. Kim and her husband Jason had been fielding phone calls from members of the media all day.Neither of them has decided whom to vote for, by the way.  I d never been to a rally and a rally is not where her mother wanted to be yesterday,  Kim Lovley told us by phone when we spoke on Tuesday afternoon.

"WHAT TRUMP JUST SAID Should Scare All Gropers in Congress Who Settled Sex Assault Cases Using Taxpayer Dollars","President Trump wants those who settled sexual harassment cases using our tax dollars to be exposed The House is responsible for the sexual assault slush fund that used our taxpayer money to pay off accusers. We should all call for this slush fund to be shut down This is NOT what our hard earned money should be paying for NEW: President Trump tells me he believe Congress should release the names of lawmakers who have settled sexual harassment claims  Trey Yingst (@TreyYingst) November 21, 2017The Transcript and video of Rep. Jackie Speier on  Face the Nation,  Nov. 19, 2017 is below. She spoke to John Dickerson and Chuck Todd before that about the $15 million in settlements for sexual harassment by congress members. Americans are furious that their tax dollars are being used in such a way WITHOUT the harasser being held accountable. These gropers should pay for this themselves!HERE S THE COMMENT FROM THE INTERVIEW BELOW THAT REALLY STANDS OUT:  we have a system in place that allows for the harasser to go unchecked. Doesn t pay for the settlement himself and is never identified. So the Office of Compliance to which a victim must apply or complain is a place that has really been an enabler of sexual harassment for these many years because of the way it s constructed.    REP JACKIE SPEIERRep. Jackie Speier, D-California, joined  Face the Nation  Sunday to discuss the fallout from the flood of sexual assault and harassment allegations across the U.S., and sexual harassment in Congress.JOHN DICKERSON: The debate over sexual harassment moved into the halls of Congress after California Democratic Congresswoman Jackie Speier went public with her own experience of unwanted sexual advances as a young Capitol Hill staffer. Speier s revelation actually inspired Leeann Tweeden to come forward with her allegations against Senator Franken.This week, Congresswoman Speier introduced legislation in the House aimed at fighting sexual harassment in Congress. And she joins us this morning from Palm Springs, California. Congresswoman, I want to start with something you wrote. You said that,  It s clear the good old boys club mentality of Capitol Hill still persists after all these years. It is perhaps the worst I ve seen in 30 years of working on these issues.  The old boys club was pretty bad. You re saying it s worse now?JACKIE SPEIER: Well, I think it s worse in part because we have a system in place that allows for the harasser to go unchecked. Doesn t pay for the settlement himself and is never identified. So the Office of Compliance to which a victim must apply or complain is a place that has really been an enabler of sexual harassment for these many years because of the way it s constructed.JOHN DICKERSON: As Congress and the larger culture tries to figure out what the standard is for treating accusers who come forward, something better than what has been where they ve been blocked, but also something that doesn t allow false accusations, how does that standard get determined, in your mind?JACKIE SPEIER: Well, first of all, we have to make sure that a complaint is taken seriously. And the person who is the victim is not somehow tortured or intimidated into not filing the complaint. That s what it is right now in Congress. There s a one month period where you re counseled. There s another month where you go through mandatory mediation and you have to sign a non disclosure agreement at the front end.And then you have a month of cooling off period. I mean, that is truly ridiculous. It s important for us to remember too, John, that over 90% of those who have been sexually harassed or sexually assaulted are telling the truth. So all these victims who have come forward with Roy Moore or with the president or with Al Franken, all of them have to be, we expect to believe them because, for the most part, they are telling the truth. There is no gain for them to come forward. There re lots of down sides, frankly.JOHN DICKERSON: What s your view about reevaluating the situation? You mentioned the president. The White House seems to suggest, and Senator Cotton also seemed to suggest that the voters knew about this. They voted for him. And so it s an issue that s in the past. How do you see it?JACKIE SPEIER: Well, I think there is some truth to that. If the president was running today, I bet he would not be elected because I think we have had a huge cultural shift that was 40 years in the making, but I think all of us are grateful now that there is a new day for women in the workplace, where they do not have to put up with sexual advances that are unwanted. That they do not have to live and work in a hostile work environment. And that s going to be good for all of us in the workplace.JOHN DICKERSON: As that cultural shift takes place, some people have argued, some Democrats and liberals have argued, that a reevaluation of Bill Clinton s presidency is required. What do you think about that in order to be clear about what the new standard is and use, you know, elements from the past that are well known?JACKIE SPEIER: Well, first of all, let s remember that he did face impeachment. It wasn t as if it was just tossed to the side. He faced impeachment. I think that the victims who came forward were not treated as they should have been. They should have been believed because, as I have pointed out, most people who come forward are telling the truth.JOHN DICKERSON: In the case of Al Franken, what s your feeling about that? There have been some columnists who ve written that basically again, liberals have said he must leave the Senate in order for Democrats to retain their credibility on this issue, or else they re open to the charge that Democrats apply it when it comes to Republicans, but are more generous when it comes to their own team.JACKIE SPEIER: I think it s appropriate for the ethics committee to do an investigation. Senator Franken has actually agreed to that as well. I also think that it has to be determined if there s a pattern of sexual harassment. Incidents have to be severe or they have to be ones that happen over a period of time. So I think we ll wait and see what the investigation determines.JOHN DICKERSON: Is that an instructive distinction then, pattern versus specific mistake in terms of what might penalize somebody but be the difference between penalizing and expulsion?JACKIE SPEIER: And that s what the Courts have held with sexual harassment cases. If there s a pattern, then sexual harassment is found to be in existence. If it s a one event and it s maybe a conversation versus, you know, sexual assault or an unwanted sexual advance, so it really depends on the circumstances in all of these cases.JOHN DICKERSON: Final question on a different topic, on taxes. Eleven of your Republican colleagues in California voted for the House tax cut bill in which deductibility of state and local taxes is no longer allowed. They were told- at least one of them was told,  Well, that ll get fixed later. And Californians who have high taxes will be able to deduct them.  What s your-do you believe that?JACKIE SPEIER: No, I don t believe it. And I think for all of those members who basically have handed their constituents a $10,000 tax increase, that s what we re talking about. When you take the state and local taxes and the property taxes and the mortgage deduction that is reduced to $500,000, it is a huge hit for every single California family.JOHN DICKERSON: All right, Congresswoman, thanks so much for being with us.

It took a split second for leftist media outlets like  Fake News  CNN to say that Trump  all but endorsed  Moore.  Twitter was exploding with faux outrage from the left. As usual, President Trump said what we re all thinking POTUS said Roy Moore  totally denies it  BUT did not endorse Moore Trump on Roy Moore sexual misconduct allegations:  He totally denies it you have to listen to him also  pic.twitter.com/HFCZjEhkFe  NBC News (@NBCNews) November 21, 2017 He denies it. Look, he denies it,  Trump said of Moore.  If you look at all the things that have happened over the last 48 hours. He totally denies it. He says it didn t happen. And look, you have to look at him also. Several women have come forward and accused Moore of pursuing romantic relationships with them when they were teenagers and he was in his 30s, and several others also have accused him of assault .Not one of them has proven anything against him.The President expressed opposition to  liberal  Democrat Doug Jones: We don t need a liberal person in there, a Democrat, Jones. I ve looked at his record. It s terrible on crime. It s terrible on the border. It s terrible on military,  Trump said.  I can tell you for a fact we do not need somebody who s going to be bad on crime, bad on borders, bad for the military, bad for the Second Amendment. President Trump left the door open to campaigning with Moore: I ll be letting you know next week,  he said, when asked whether he will campaign with Moore.Trump repeatedly emphasized that Jones has denied the allegations brought against him:Trump declined to say whether he believed Moore s denials, but when asked he again pointed to the denials.   Well, he denies. I mean, he denies. I mean, Roy Moore denies it. And by the way, it is a total denial. And I do have to say 40 years is a long time. He s run eight races and this has never come up. Forty years is a long time,  Trump said, pointing to the amount of time that has passed since the alleged behavior. ",politics,"Nov 21, 2017"
"BALL FAMILY MEMBER Reveals SICK Reason LaVar Ball Allegedly Wouldnt Let His Sons See Their Mother After Surgery To Remove Portion of Her Skull","Last week, President Trump stepped in and interceded on behalf of three young UCLA basketball players who foolishly were caught shoplifting in China. Shoplifting in China is not treated lightly and most likely would have resulted in a prison term for all three young men. President Trump was able to convince China s President Xi, however, to release the three young men from custody. When asked how the loudmouth father of  LiAngelo Ball felt about President Trump helping to secure the release of his son, LiAngelo, LaVar Ball suggested the President had little to do with the matter. Who?  Ball told ESPN when asked about Trump s involvement in the situation.  What was he over there for? Don t tell me nothing. Everybody wants to make it seem like he helped me out. They try to make a big deal out of nothing sometimes.  I m from L.A. I ve seen a lot worse things happen than a guy taking some glasses. President Trump took to Twitter to reply to LaVar Ball s ignorant comments:Now that the three basketball players are out of China and saved from years in jail, LaVar Ball, the father of LiAngelo, is unaccepting of what I did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal. I should have left them in jail!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2017So who is this crackpot LaVar Ball, and why would anyone in their right mind make such arrogant and ignorant remarks after the President of the United States just helped their son to escape a prison sentence in a foreign country?  Andrew Stephens of the Armchair All Americans did a pretty good job of summing up what a horrible human being the self-serving, money, and fame-obsessed LaVar Ball really is. In his article, Stephens reveals a sick man, who is so controlling of his 3 sons and their basketball careers, that he wouldn t even let them visit their very sick mother in the hospital, over fears that it could create media attention that could damage his merchandise brand. On March 15, 2017, Andrew Stephens of Armchair All Americans published an article about Lavar Ball titled Lavar Ball: The epitome of what is wrong with modern sports. It touched on helicopter parenting and the monetization of potentially profitable children.Stephens claimed that in the article, without commenting on upbringing tactics, I attempted to delve into Lavar Ball s seemingly unnecessary promotion of his own sons for his personal benefit.About an hour after the article was run, I received a comment on it from a member of the Ball family, who wishes to remain anonymous. The comment (which has since been removed to protect the email address and identity of the commenter) read as follows:- Wow. You nailed it. Although you don t even know the half of it. Lavar took over the high school program, added the Coach, his puppet (which is why he quit last year after becoming the national coach of the year) and Lavar stepped on and crushed countless other kids  careers and love for the game to get his kids on the court. If you are allowed to shoot at any time from any where and never come out of the game, any decent idiot could score 30 points.Also, Tina Ball, his wife had a stroke on Feb 21. She had life threatening skull surgery to relieve brain pressure   guess where Lavar was during the operation that could have killed his wife?   at the CHHS vs. LB Poly game with his sons, including Lonzo. He still has not allowed his kids to see their sick mother due to the media attention it would bring to him, and cause BBB sales to diminish. [Name of hospital] in [City of hospital], CA   Tina is there now and he only visits for 1 hour a few days a week, while her Mother has yet to leave her side. Pathetic!!! I was a bit skeptical when I initially viewed the comment. I figured that it was someone attempting to drive a smear campaign against the Ball family, seeing how Lavar was such a polarizing figure. But, the information was oddly specific.After a bit of deliberation, I contacted the email address listed with the comment. They confirmed through multiple email and social media confirmations that they were, in fact, a close relative of Lavar and Tina Ball. I also spoke with the hospital listed in the email. The hospital confirmed that Tina Ball was checked in as of 12:30 PM EST on March 15.Tina, who was very active on Twitter, stopped communication on February 19, which fits in with the timeline provided below by a member of the Ball family.Watch this video as the loud-mouth, obnoxious LaVar Ball is interviewed on the Skip and Shannon Undisputed sports show.One of the first questions the female host asked of LaVar was about his desire to have a reality show made about him and his family (Keep in mind, this interview took place shortly after a very serious stroke). It s hard not to pick up on the sadness expressed on the face of his oldest son Lonzo Ball, while his overbearing father dominates the conversation and makes a complete ass of himself:When confirming the identity of the member of the Ball family that commented via email, we received another large piece of harrowing information: Notice, she is not at any games, she is not at work, and she is not at home. Someone needs to ask the question, where is Tina? She is severely disabled and paralyzed on right side. Cannot talk and is questionable about her comprehension. Left side of her brain impacted with massive stroke, while at home on Feb. 21 (school holiday   President s day). Tina is a PE teacher in [City of school],CA [Name of school].Feb. 20: Tina Ball admitted at [Name of first hospital] ICUFeb. 21: Surgery to remove a portion of her skull to reduce swelling from the stroke (evening)Feb 21: Chino Hills vs LB Poly @ Cerritos College   evening game (same time as surgery) Lavar & Lonzo at the game with the other Ball boys   missed the surgery and post op. Did not come to hospital during or after surgery. The Ball boys are not allowed to see their mother, Lavar is afraid it will take away from their game(s). Lonzo had big game at ASU and U of A later that week. Also, media buzz would take away from all the interviews and media touring for Lavar + BBB brand would suffer. It literally is bigger than Tina s life, as evidenced by Lavar s approach. As a family member, I am embarrassed and feel so sorry for Tina, since Lavar is on a media tour, he visits her rarely, while her mother has stayed by her side continuously. The crux of the original story was rooted in that fact that Lavar Ball s priorities were self-motivated and not for the betterment of a  family brand.  After hearing the explicit details given to us, if these allegations are true   it only confirms one thing for Lavar Ball: money and fame are king.LaVar recently attempted to sell his Ball s Big Baller Brand for a billion dollars. When major shoe companies laughed at his offer, he raised his price to 3 billion dollars. How Ball ever got his product line this far is really quite amazing.  When LaVar Ball said he wanted $1 billion for a Big Baller Brand co-branding shoe deal for his three sons, the big shoe companies scoffed.After that rejection, Big Baller Brand released Lonzo Ball s first signature shoe, the ZO2, and decided to charge a minimum of $495 for a pair. LaVar told Colin Cowherd on Wednesday that companies like Nike, Adidas and Under Armour will regret not forking over $1 billion and that he s decided to raise the price for a deal. Now that Lonzo s headed to Los Angeles, what they should have done is give me a billion dollars and let me be on my way,  LaVar said, referring to the Lakers drawing the No. 2 pick in next month s NBA draft.But now? Apparently, the draft lottery results tripled Big Baller Brand s value. Now you know if they want to talk to me now, it just went up to $3 billion. Triple B s billion, billion, billion,  he told Sports Illustrated.LaVar had a chance to fix his embarrassing error of disrespecting the President for the gift he gave their family, but instead chose to double down on stupid, in one of the most painfully ignorant interviews you will ever witness, with CNN s Chris Cuomo:",politics,"Nov 21, 2017"
"FORMER NFL PLAYER: UCLA Players Dad Said Dumbest Thing [Video]","Former NFL player Shannon Sharpe on Tuesday called LaVar Ball s complaints directed at President Donald Trump the  dumbest thing  he could have said. Sharpe is usually as anti-Trump as they come but is just smart enough to understand that it s idiotic to diss the president. Sharpe makes some dumb comments during the rant about LaVar Ball but it s pretty big that he is supportive of President Trump:Sharpe appeared to take Trump s side in the feud and said the president s involvement in China  didn t hurt the situation. I can assure you President Trump mentioning [the detainment] to the Chinese President didn t hurt his situation. If he [LaVar Ball] felt this strongly, why didn t the hell he say that while they were over there? This is when he should have been vocal.  Sharpe said.Sharpe also asked why, if Trump didn t help the situation, why did all three players personally thank him? Why did all three of those guys get up there and say thank President Trump, personally? Thank the American government, personally?  Sharpe inquired.  I didn t hear one of them mention LaVar Ball s name. I did hear three  President Trumps  and three  American government.  Now they get back on American soil, he [LaVar Ball] wants to pound his chest. I see why President Trump used the word  ungrateful,'  he added.Later in the segment, Sharpe said Trump wouldn t have had to say anything about LiAngelo Ball if he hadn t attempted to steal. President Trump would have said nothing about the boy. If your son would have had kept his sticky ass fingers in his pockets, and not take peoples  stuff in China, we wouldn t even be having this conversation,  Sharpe said, directing his comments to LaVar Ball.In the past, Sharpe has criticized Trump, especially over the president s comments about player protests in the NFL.

"WATCH: CNNs Chris Cuomo Stunned At STUPIDITY of LaVar Ball After Refusing To Thank President Trump For Helping His Son Get Out of Chinese Jail Sentence","CNN host Chris Cuomo definitely drew the short straw when he was asked to fill in for host Don Lemon, on  Tonight with Don Lemon . Unfortunately for Cuomo, he was tasked with interviewing the outrageous, nonsensical Lavar Ball, father of UCLA basketball player LiAngelo Ball, who was arrested in China for shoplifting. Americans were outraged when Lavar refused to  thank  President Trump for asking Chinese President Xi to allow the young men to be set free, and took it a step further when he insisted Trump didn t deserve any credit for his son s release.Watch:CNN compiled a list of some of Lavar Ball s most incredible comments during the interview. Here is a sampling of Lavar s bizarre remarks during the interview (Our comments are in italics): It s not like he was in the US and said, OK, there s three kids in China, I need to go over there and get them? That wasn t the thought process, right? I don t have to say, to go around saying thank you to everybody. You come around and shake my hand, and meet me, or meet my son, or anybody and then say you know what, maybe I can help you out. Just because people say things, you know, that s supposed to be true, like hey, I stopped him from serving ten years. Maybe we were doing some talking with other people before he even got there. I don t have   no doubts about what he did. I got doubts about what he didn t do. Huh? If I m coming to get you out of trouble, you best believe I m going to take you with me. It s just somebody ask me a question and I gave a lot of confusion to you. Uhh while we re talking about confusion, can someone please explain what the hell he just said? Why is it confusing? Are you concerned? Somebody can make a suggestion and somebody could do something. You have people that make suggestions you got people that do things. Why are we talking about this with all these political matters going on in the world? Says the guy who has no idea why President Trump was in China in the first place. I know exactly what I said. But you buffered it up like you said that you don t want to say thank you to nobody. Buffered it up? I know you re trying to add tone to it because that s what you do. Can you  add tone  to someone s tone when they, themselves are speaking on tv? I had some things done, I talked to some people that did some things, too. If you want something, and you want it, you shouldn t just go and steal it. You can to Africa and somewhere and do the same thing anywhere you go in someone else s country, yes, it s going to be a little deeper than what you thought it was. Ball asked Cuomo if Trump paid their bail, suggesting that if he did, then, he would be grateful to the President. This comment is nothing short of spectacularly incredible. I m asking you, I m asking you. Did he do it? Let him do his political affairs and let me handle my son and let s just stay in our lane. Somebody asked me a question, man. I give him my opinion, but I am not taking a shot at the president.  Yeah, okay Lavar. Whatever you say I m not the other guys, though. I m not the other guys. I m doing something else. I m not the other guys.  Lavar Ball then goes on to ask CNN host Chris Cuomo to  thank  him. Can you say thank you, Mr. LaVar Ball? When Cuomo seems to be confused as to why Ball is asking him to  thank  Ball, Ball then asks another idiotic question:  Give me a couple of reasons why you re thanking me. You don t say thank you like any kind of word. Next, Lavar reminds the CNN host that he has a title, and would appreciate it if Chris Cuomo would address him by his title: My title is LaVar Ball, the big baller, the CEO of the Big Baller Brand. But the Chinese people were like, you know what, he s OK. He has so much character in 18 years that he s allow to have a pass for that. Uhh actually, no they weren t. They were thinking about how many years his son would be sentenced, possibly to hard labor for the crimes he committed in their country.This may be the funniest line of all. Ball asks the anti-Trump CNN host if he s  Trump s brother ? Are you Trump s brother? You want me to thank you? Did you thank the doctor for bringing you into this world? Well, you better go back and find him. Because you lucky. Apparently, this is Lavar logic Ball then changes gears and makes yet another strange comment: I like how you keep saying my whole name, man. Cuomo then responds to Ball, explaining that his friends call him  Mo.   My friends call me Mo. You can call me Mo. Finally, Ball makes his final and completely ignorant remark to end the completely off-the-wall segment with Cuomo:  Chrome-Mo like Google. Like the Google Chrome.  ???????????

At the time Uranium One controlled roughly 20 percent of American uranium mining capacity.In fact, the evidence obtained by the Department of Justice and FBI, starting as early as 2008, paint a much different picture than that of recent reports regarding the confidential informant, William D. Campbell Jr., and his role. According to the documents, Campbell gained insight into Russia s strategic plans to gain global dominance in the uranium industry and to build a closer relationship with Obama administration officials.Read the full report at: SaraCarter.com",politics,"Nov 21, 2017"

Four more women have come forward to charge Bill Clinton sexually assaulted them This could get interesting You know, with Hillary coming out last week with a lecture on standing up for women Will she  stand by her man  or not?Edward Klein is the former editor in chief of the New York Times Magazine and the author of numerous bestsellers including his fourth book on the Clintons, Guilty as Sin, in 2016. His latest book is All Out War: The Plot to Destroy Trump was released on October 30, 2017. Bill Clinton is facing explosive new charges of sexual assault from four women, according to highly placed Democratic Party sources and an official who served in both the Clinton and Obama administrations.The current accusations against the 71-year-old former president   whose past is littered with charges of sexual misconduct   stem from the period after he left the White House in 2001, say the sources.Attorneys representing the women, who are coordinating their efforts, have notified Clinton they are preparing to file four separate lawsuits against him.As part of the ongoing negotiations, the attorneys for the women are asking for substantial payouts in return for their clients  silence.A member of Clinton s legal team has confirmed the existence of the new allegations.Back in the late 1990s, Clinton paid $850,000 to settle a sexual harassment lawsuit by Paula Jones, a former Arkansas state employee whose case led to Clinton s impeachment in the House of Representatives and his subsequent acquittal by the Senate in 1999. The negotiations in the new lawsuits are said to have reached a critical stage. If they fail, according to sources in Clinton s inner circle, the four women are said to be ready to air their accusations of sexual assault at a press conference, making Clinton the latest   and most famous   figure in a long list of men from Harvey Weinstein to Kevin Spacey who have recently been accused of sexual assault.The new allegations refer to incidents that took place more than 10 years ago, in the early 2000s, when Clinton was hired by Ron Burkle, the playboy billionaire investor, to work at his Yucaipa companies. Clinton helped Burkle generate business and flew around the world with a flock of beautiful young women on Burkle s private jet, which was nicknamed  Air F**k One.  The four women, who have not yet revealed their identities, were employed in low-level positions at the Burkle organization when they were in their late teens and claim they were sexually assaulted by the former president.Read more: Daily Mail",politics,"Nov 20, 2017"

"JUST IN: Veteran Journalist of 45 Years Suspended by CBS, PBS, Bloomberg After Multiple Women Claim Harassment","Who knew? Probably everyone in the news biz knew but said nothing. Charlie Rose has been groping women for years. It has come to this if a woman accuses you, you re gone, gone, gone. Apparently, several women came forward and accused the smooth talking veteran journalist of sexual misconduct. Charlie Rose immediately issued a statement apologizing but saying all claims aren t accurate. Charlie Rose was a groper? Wow!CHARLIE ROSE IS TOAST In response to a Washington Post report detailing multiple accusations of inappropriate conduct, PBS and Bloomberg announced on Monday afternoon that both companies will stop distributing Charlie Rose s eponymous show, Charlie Rose. The nightly show is produced by Rose s company, Charlie Rose Inc.Separately, CBS announced that Rose is suspended from his role as CBS This Morning co-host.  Charlie Rose is suspended immediately while we look into this matter,  the network said. Rose is also a contributing correspondent for 60 Minutes.The Post spoke to eight women for the story about Rose, which focuses on his treatment of Charlie Rose employees between the late 1990s and 2011. None of the women worked for CBS or PBS, according to the report, and PBS, CBS and Bloomberg all told the newspaper that  they have no records of sexual harassment complaints about Charlie Rose. PBS was shocked to learn today of these deeply disturbing allegations,  the organization in a statement.  We are immediately suspending distribution of  Charlie Rose.     PBS does not fund this nightly program or supervise its production, but we expect our producers to provide a workplace where people feel safe and are treated with dignity and respect.  In a statement, Bloomberg said:  We are deeply disturbed to learn of these allegations and are immediately suspending the show from airing on Bloomberg TV. WHO KNEW? ROSE IS A SERIAL GROPER? Most of the women said Rose alternated between fury and flattery in his interactions with them,  the Post reported.  Five described Rose putting his hand on their legs, sometimes their upper thigh, in what they perceived as a test to gauge their reactions. Two said that while they were working for Rose at his residences or were traveling with him on business, he emerged from the shower and walked naked in front of them. One said he groped her buttocks at a staff party. ROSE ISSUES STATEMENT Rose addressed the allegations in a statement to the Post and to reporters following publication. He said:  In my 45 years in journalism, I have prided myself on being an advocate for the careers of the women with whom I have worked. Nevertheless, in the past few days, claims have been made about my behavior toward some former female colleagues. It is essential that these women know I hear them and that I deeply apologize for my inappropriate behavior. I am greatly embarrassed.

It received later installments as they were written at the height of the presidential campaign, which means the bureau has had more than a year to investigate the allegations in the document.The dossier was financed by the Hillary Clinton campaign and compiled by former British spy Christopher Steele.An August 24, 2017 subpoena from the House Intelligence Committee to the FBI and Justice Department asked for information on the bureau s efforts to validate the dossier. Specifically, the subpoena demanded  any documents, if they exist, that memorialize DOJ and/or FBI efforts to corroborate, validate, or evaluate information provided by Mr. Steele and/or sub-sources and/or contained in the  Trump Dossier. According to sources familiar with the matter, neither the FBI nor the Justice Department has provided documents in response to that part of the committee s subpoena.

This is the thing though  if a woman sleeps with your husband, you re not going to necessarily embrace them  That s why when he brought up these allegations, I wonder if she missed the opportunity to address it in a way that the public would understand  Hostin mused.Behar disagreed, joking that there wasn t much Hillary Clinton could say to the women.Behar suggested the Democratic nominee could say:  I would like to apologize to those tramps that have slept with my husband.  Maybe she could have said that.

"LAVAR BALL: Heres Why President Trump Was Under No Legal Obligation To Help Release Your Shoplifting Son From Chinese Prison","Before Lavar Ball, the ungrateful father of accused criminal, and UCLA basketball player, LiAngelo Ball, goes off on a public rant about how unappreciative he for President Trump s help, when he interceded on behalf of his son and 2 other UCLA basketball players, who were caught shoplifting at a Louis Vuitton store in China, he may want to consider, that without the help of President Trump, his son could be sitting in a Chinese prison for the next 10 years.Lavar Ball might also want to consider that President Trump was under no obligation to ask President Xi to get involved in the public relations nightmare that took place while our President was a guest in China, to help negotiate their release, and here s why   Days after President Donald Trump touted his role in the release of three UCLA basketball students who were arrested in China, LaVar Ball, the father of one of those players, suggested the President had little to do with the matter. Who?  Ball told ESPN when asked about Trump s involvement in the situation.  What was he over there for? Don t tell me nothing. Everybody wants to make it seem like he helped me out. They try to make a big deal out of nothing sometimes.  I m from L.A. I ve seen a lot worse things happen than a guy taking some glasses.    LaVar Ball, father of UCLA player with  sticky fingers Law Newz   Our Tweeter-in-Chief lashed out on Twitter Sunday after Ball, a businessman, and ex-basketball player, downplayed POTUS  role in helping release son LiAngelo Ball from Chinese custody.Now that the three basketball players are out of China and saved from years in jail, LaVar Ball, the father of LiAngelo, is unaccepting of what I did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal. I should have left them in jail!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 19, 2017 I should have left them in jail,  Trump wrote. That s a hell of thing to tweet, and it grabbed a lot of attention. Outlets like Mediaite, The NY Times, Fox News, and ESPN were all over it. But as with many things in this administration, it s always helpful to review a president s role in situations like this.To recap, we have three Americans UCLA basketball players LiAngelo Ball, Jalen Hill and Cody Riley arrested by Chinese authorities for alleged shoplifting. Trump took credit for their return to the states, saying he asked the country s president Xi Jinping for help. Now we have that same president saying he should ve done nothing.What does it mean if provable spite motivated a president s decision to refrain from helping an American held in custody on foreign soil? Law&Crime reached out to Harvard Law Professor Noah Feldman for his take on the matter and asked if such behavior, or something like it, could be impeachable. Not impeachable,  Feldman wrote in an email.  He was under no duty to help and no duty to be nice about it after the fact. ",politics,"Nov 19, 2017"
"JUST IN: CLOSE FRIEND of Hillary Clinton Who Planned To Step Away From Politics Found DEAD In Apparent Suicide","Houston, Texas trial lawyer and Democrat mega-donor Steve Mostyn died on Thursday in what authorities are saying was a  suicide,  according to the Houston Chronicle. Mr. Mostyn was only 46, he left behind a wife and several children, and earlier this year had announced that he was going to be stepping away from politics to spend more time with his family.Details about how Mr. Mostyn allegedly committed suicide are slim. However, his family said that it happened after he  suddenly  became afflicted with some sort of mental illness then took his own life, although they weren t clear as to what type of mental illness he suffered from.But it is worth noting that Mr. Mostyn had never suffered from mental illness in the past, according to his family, further raising suspicions over the manner in which he died.Mr. Mostyn was a progressive powerhouse who was heavily involved in politics throughout his career. He made his fortunes off of suing insurance companies after hurricanes ravaged his state, and used his wealth to fund numerous Democrat and progressive causes, including the Super PAC  Ready for Hillary,  which he and his wife co-founded with Susie Tompkins Buell, a radical environmentalist and member of George Soros s Democracy Alliance.Mr. Mostyn s wife, Amber, was also a member of the Democracy Alliance and a close friend of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who was the keynote speaker at a 2010 Annie s List event honoring Amber. The Mostyns were close to the Clintons in general, having held numerous high-dollar fundraisers for Hillary s failed 2016 presidential run at their Houston home.Houston Chronicle  In 2012 alone, Mostyn donated $5.2 million to various pro-Democratic Super PACs ranging from Planned Parenthood to Texans for America s Future to Priorities USA Action, a pro-Barack Obama PAC, according to the Center for Public Integrity.In 2014, he and his wife donated approximately $3 million to Democratic candidates, including state Sen. Wendy Davis, who we running against Republican Greg Abbott. Davis lost. I am heartbroken,  Davis tweeted Thursday.  Texas has lost an extraordinary person. Steve was a committed and effective fighter for justice, a wonderful husband, father and friend. He leaves behind a lasting impact on everyone who s life he touched. Mostyn and his wife, Amber, were co-founders of the Ready for Hillary PAC, a political action committee supporting Clinton s unsuccessful campaign for president. At the same time, state campaign finance records show he also contributed to a police-affiliated PAC that supported Republican primary candidates.Mostyn also help fund the Texas Organizing Project and Battleground Texas, two Democratic comeback strategies for the party that has not won a statewide election in two decades. It s hard to really quantify the hole it leaves for progressives. He s probably the first true financial benefactor for progressives in Houston, and I say that because it s really different than supporting individual candidates the way trial lawyers have collectively in the past. He really supported the underlying causes, which is a different kind of take, and I m not sure that gets filled, certainly not immediately. Despite the Mostyns and the law firm s high-profile political activism   they contributed more than $1.8 million to Texas politicians in 2016   Mostyn told the Texas Tribune in a September interview that he was growing tired of almost single-handedly funding Democratic candidates in a state that was solidly Republican.He said he intended to downscale his political giving to Democrats in Texas elections to encourage others to step forward.  We ve asked other people to do it and they want to do it and I want other people to get credit for doing it,  the Tribune quoted him as saying.  I mean this is a giant, giant state, if we were trying to flip Vermont we d be done. However, their relationship came under stress in 2015, when ethics watchdog group Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT) filed a formal complaint against Hillary and her campaign for illegal coordination with the Ready for Hillary Super PAC, the Daily Caller reported. FACT has also asked the Senate Select Committee on Ethics to look into an April 21 meeting in which Clinton campaign aides attended a weekly meeting of Senate Democrats. FACT asserts that the meeting violates ruleThis wasn t the first time the Clinton and Mostyns found themselves being questioned over unethical practices. In 2010, Hillary Clinton s State Department pushed through a multi-billion dollar deal for Boeing in Russia, and just two months later the company gave nearly a million dollars to the Clinton Foundation.Just a short time later, Boeing s top lobbyist and former Bill Clinton aide Tim Keating partnered with Mr. Mostyn s Super PAC to do a joint fundraising venture for Hillary s planned presidential campaign.  America s Freedom FightersFrom FOX News   When Hillary Clinton was America s top diplomat, she also appeared at times like a top salesperson for America s biggest airplane maker, Boeing.Traveling abroad on official business as secretary of state, Clinton often visited Boeing facilities and made a pitch for the host country to buy Boeing jets. During one visit to Shanghai in May 2010, she boasted that  more than half the commercial jetliners operating in China are made by Boeing. A sales plug in Russia in 2009, though, may have proved especially fruitful. While touring a Boeing plant, Secretary of State Clinton said,  We re delighted that a new Russian airline, Rossiya, is actively considering acquisition of Boeing aircraft, and this is a shameless pitch. In 2010, Boeing landed the Russian deal, worth $3.7 billion. And two months later, the company donated $900,000 to the Clinton Foundation.This chain of events is raising new questions for Clinton, and Boeing, as the former secretary of state launches her 2016 presidential campaign. The Boeing deal only adds to a growing list of business deals involving Clinton Foundation donors now coming under scrutiny.Boeing shareholder David Almasi recently confronted CEO James McNerney about the ethics of it. That opens the door to charges of honest services fraud, that there was a quid pro quo between the Clinton Foundation, the State Department, and Boeing,  Almasi said.In prepared answers to questions posed to Boeing by Fox News, a spokesman defended the company s actions. Our contribution to the Clinton Foundation to help the people of Haiti rebuild was a transparent act of compassion and an investment aimed at aiding the long-term interests and hopes of the Haitian people,  the spokesman said. The company also pointed out that it gave the American Red Cross $1.3 million after the devastating 2010 earthquake.Clinton defenders say there is no smoking gun.  There s zero evidence that Hillary Clinton went to bat for Boeing for any reason other than to benefit the U.S. economy and U.S. workers,  said former Clinton/Gore adviser Richard Goldstein.But the financial connections don t end there. Boeing also paid former President Bill Clinton $250,000 for a speech in 2012. It was a speech that was approved by the State Department s Ethics Office   which according to an Associated Press report often approved the ex-president s speaking engagements within days.Here is a list of mysterious deaths tied to the Clinton s:1   James McDougal   Clinton s convicted Whitewater partner died of an apparent heart attack, while in solitary confinement.

"HOW SO? CNN HOST Makes Claim President Trump Is Race Baiting UCLA Players Ungrateful Dad In Hysterical Tweet [Video]","CNN anchor Brian Stelter went off on President Trump this afternoon for his tweet hitting back at the father of the UCLA player who was arrested in China for shoplifting. Fredricka Whitfield put on her best puzzled face and said to Stelter,  the way this President prioritizes is very confusing to a lot of people. Stelter noted how this time last year Trump was touting how  restrained  he would be on Twitter: If this is restrained, I can t imagine what it would look like if he were to be unrestrained. I mean, think about this. He s just recently let the NFL kneeling controversy start to subside, start to fade away, and now here he is calling out these players and the families again. I think it s immature at best, Fred, but it s really race-baiting at worst. That s gonna be debated, that s gonna be argued about, but I want to put that on the table: it sure looks like race-baiting to a lot of people. HOW THE HECK IS THIS RACE-BAITING? This is the same doofus who said President Trump s tweets about Puerto Rico were  dog whistles Why is it always racism with the left? Why?RACE BAITING? HOW IS THIS RACE BAITING?HERE S THE PRESIDENT S TWEET AND LAVAR BALL S COMMENT   HOW IN THE HECK IS THIS ANYTHING BUT THE TRUTH? Oh my gosh! This is awesome!

"LOL! DESPERATE KATHY GRIFFIN Makes Home Video To Complain About Not Getting Work After Trump Beheading Stunt&Takes Page From Hillarys Playbook&Blames Everyone Else For End Of Her Career","Wow! Poor Kathy Griffin The toxic  comedian  found herself facing a tsunami-sized backlash after she held a severed, and bloodied head of President Trump, during a comedy skit earlier in the year. And now, the former  funny girl  is telling anyone who will listen, that she s furious no one wants to hire her. Kathy Griffin starts her homemade 5-minute video by whining to viewers about all of the online  hate  by  trolls  that she s receiving. Griffin then goes on to trash the other  not funny  comedian Lena Dunham, who wrote about sexually assaulting her little sister, for defending a Hollywood actor who s been accused of sexually assaulting a female actress. Her comments that follow the Dunham remarks make no sense, although she seems to be attempting to make the point that the equally trashy liberal comedian, Lena Dunham, is still getting work, and how Griffin just doesn t think that it s fair. (After all, Dunham hates Trump as much as her right?)Griffin tells the camera that appears to be set up in her living room,  I just want you guys to know that I am fully in the middle of a blacklist like I m in the middle of a Hollywood blacklist. It is real. I m not booked on any talk shows. Griffen continued to whine about her lack of jobs,  I just want you guys to know, that when I get home, I do not have one single day of paid work in front of me, and the people who want me to go back and do clubs and do 10 minutes again I don t mean to be an asshole, but I m not gonna do that. I ve worked way too hard to go back and work for free, and do the club scene again because this is some bullshit. Because I ve been blacklisted.Griffin then goes on to tell her fellow Hollywood libs to stop sending her requests for donations to their fundraisers because she doesn t have any money. She goes on to explain that she s spent all of her money on lawyers because she believes in something. Griffin can t quite find a way to articulate what that something is, but she s apparently learned her lesson and has refrained from exposing her true obsession and desire, which was to destroy Donald Trump.Watch: ",politics,"Nov 19, 2017"

Socialist Bernie Sanders was asked whether Senator Al Franken should step down following an accusation of sexual misconduct. Bernie replied that,  Al is a very popular senator . He totally dodges a yes or no answer what a hypocrite!

PROOF OF GROPING WITH FRANKEN BUT ZERO PROOF WITH MOORE:A Los Angeles-based radio anchor wrote Franken aggressively kissed her without consent during a USO tour in 2006, and she also published a photo of Franken apparently groping her breasts while she slept. Franken apologized, and he said he would cooperate with an ethics investigation. I think that s a decision for Al Franken and the people of the state of Minnesota,  Sanders said.  My understanding is that Al is a very popular senator. People in Minnesota think that he is doing a good job, and his political future will rest with the people of Minnesota.

"WATCH: Colin Kaepernicks Worst Nightmare [Video]","You might remember this bright moment from when Obama was president A couple of years ago, 500 high school choir students sang the Star-Spangled Banner in the 18-story atrium of a Hyatt hotel in Louisville as part of the Kentucky Music Educators Convention. Any anti-anthem liberals in the building probably ran out screaming into the night:Good thing Louisville doesn t have an NFL team. If there had been a visiting team in the building, some of the players would have had to put their helmets on to keep their skulls from exploding.REMEMBER WHEN OBAMA SUPPORTED KAEPERNICK S ANTI-ANTHEM PROTEST? OBAMA DEFENDS KAEPERNICK S Decision to Disrespect American Flag:  He s generated more interest in something that needs to be talked about When Obama had the opportunity to speak out against 49er s quarterback Colin Kaepernick s disrespect for our flag, he chose instead to defend his actions, explaining that it was okay for him to sit out the national anthem, as long as he was bringing attention to the cop-hating/killing, divisive Black Lives Matter terror group President Obama said San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick is  exercising his constitutional right  to sit out the national anthem, but the president acknowledged that the silent protest is a  tough thing  for military service members to accept.At a news conference in China on Monday, the president said he did not doubt Kaepernick s sincerity in his decision not to stand for the anthem ahead of games to protest the treatment of African Americans by law enforcement in U.S. cities. Obama noted a  long history  of sports figures protesting political or social issues. There are a lot of ways you can do it,  Obama said after the G-20 summit here.  As a general matter when it comes to the flag and the national anthem and the meaning that holds for our men and women in uniform and those who fought for us   that is a tough thing for them to get past to then hear what his deeper concerns are. But I don t doubt his sincerity. I think he cares about some real, legitimate issues that have to be talked about. If nothing else, he s generated more conversation about issues that have to be talked about. Obama said he has not closely followed the controversy surrounding Kaepernick s actions while he has been overseas, but he said he was aware of the public response, which has been sharply divided. The president has sought to balance his own response to the unrest and mistrust between African Americans and police officers over the past several years, including in Baton Rouge and Dallas this year. You ve heard me talk in the past about the need for us to have an active citizenry,  Obama said.  Sometimes that s messy and controversial and gets people angry and frustrated. But I d rather have young people that are engaged in the argument and trying to think through how they can be part of our democratic process than people just sitting on the sidelines not participating at all. My suspicion is that over time he s going to refine how he thinks about it. Maybe some of his critics will start seeing that he had a point about concerns about justice and equality. That s how we move forward.    Washington Post ",politics,"Nov 18, 2017"

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2017The Republican president was likely responding to a Mother Jones interview published Friday in which Clinton questioned last year s election results, amid evidence that Russia tried to influence the race outcome. She called for an independent commission to investigate the matter.Clinton, in the interview, also alleged voter suppression in the 2016 race, saying,  In a couple of places, most notably Wisconsin, I think it had a dramatic impact on the outcome.   FOX NewsIn case America has forgotten why Donal Trump trounced Hillary in the polls, watch the short clip from their second presidential debate below:The very sick Hillary Clinton barely made it through to the November election without needing a stretcher, while running her very lackadaisical 2016 presidential campaign. It would be very interesting to see Hillary attempt a comeback 4 years later.Watch, as Hillary collapes while attempting to enter her van after leaving a 9-11 memorial service early, reportedly because she was suffering a mysterious medical situation that required her to leave during the ceremony. At first, her campaign said she was suffering from heat exaustion, after the American public refused to buy their excuse,  the campaign then said she had pnuemonia. After several weeks of watching her being propped up and carried around by the arm like a candidate who has one foot on a banana peel and the other in her grave, following her 9-11  incident , we re definitely not buying it.This IS NOT heat related. #HillarysHealth pic.twitter.com/PFNfCEVFrV  John Cardillo (@johncardillo) September 11, 2016And then, there is the long list of crimes committed by Hillary, that she has yet to be prosecuted for.The list of Hillary s crimes continues to grow, even after the election. Just before the 2016 presidential election, Breitbart put together a list of a few of the most well-documented crimes and national security nightmares that are in her resume. Here is the list:Clinton is promising expanded numbers of Syrian refugees brought to the United States, despite the fact that 99.1% of the 13,210 refugees admitted to the US in 2016 are Muslim and the FBI has said there is no way to adequately vet them for terrorist connections and sympathies.Our true national scandal is not that Clinton has so far escaped indictment, it is that so many of our civic and political institutions have been corrupted by a misguided loyalty to the Clinton crime syndicate.From the board rooms of Wall Street to the editorial boards of local newspapers and the town halls of the League of Women Voters, the defense of the  progressive cause  has come down to defending the indefensible  pay-for-play cronyism, open borders and national security breaches on a global scale.A full chronicle of Hillary Clinton s crimes will someday fill a large shelf of books, if not a whole library.There could be no better news for President Donald Trump in 2020, than the announcement that Hillary was going to throw her hat in the ring for the third time.

"CROOKED DEMOCRAT Congresswoman Corrine Brown Found GUILTY of STEALING Scholarship Money From Children&Blames RACISM For Verdict","Celebrated Congressional Black Caucus member, and  legend  Corrine Brown would like Americans to believe that stealing hundreds of thousands of dollars from underpriveleged children in her district, and using the money to vacation with her daughter, is not the reason she s been found guilty of 18 counts of fraud and corruption, it s because she is black. Washington Examiner   She partied with Nancy Pelosi, traveled on Air Force one next to President Obama, and cast her superdelegate vote for Hillary Clinton. But on February 9, 2017, Corrine Brown was in federal court for stealing scholarship money from school children.The disgraced congresswoman attempted to defend against charges that she funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars from a non-profit charity, One Door for Education, into her own pocket.After her former chief of staff testified against her, the question was no longer whether or not she s guilty. It s why Democrat brass would continually cozy up to a congresswoman who was so clearly corrupt?From the beginning, Brown s been shrouded in controversy. Shortly after she won election in 1992, the Federal Election Commission accused Brown of violating numerous campaign finance laws. Most notably, she accepted donations from foreign citizens and failed to report the use of a corporate plane. And that s just the tip of the ethical iceberg.A convenient rap sheet, put together last July by the Florida Times-Union, documents every allegation of wrongdoing brought against Brown during her 27-year career. Hollywood couldn t have better scripted some of the highlights.In 1998, Brown cashed a $10,000 check from Rev. Henry Lyons, the disgraced president of the National Baptist Convention who spent five years in federal prison for fraud. The congresswoman said tthat she used the unreported money to bus her supporters to an event.In 2000, Brown battled back a House Ethics investigation into her efforts to free imprisoned West African millionaire Foutanga Dit Babani Sissoko from federal prison. She appealed to Attorney General Janet Reno for help, asking her to spring Sissoko from prison. Though unsuccessful, Brown received a new Lexus worth $50,000 for her trouble.And in 2008, Brown took heat from the mayor of Jacksonville after she had sandbags delivered by the city to protect her home from Tropical Storm Fay. The congresswoman eventually pledged to pay the city $886.But none of this dissuaded Democrats from palling around the Florida woman. It s mind boggling that Brown not only fundraised with the president but also enjoyed prominent perches on the Transportation and Veteran Affairs Committees.First Coast News   On Thursday, November 16, 2017, the former Jacksonville area Congresswoman Corrine Brown took the stand, and plead for mercy from federal judge Timothy Corrigan. I am sorry you have to be here today to see me in this situation,  Brown said in her statement to the court.  I never imagined I would one day be in court asking people to speak on my behalf   never. In hindsight, I wished I had been more diligent in overseeing my personal and professional life The idea that some people could believe these charges hurt me because it runs contrary to everything I ve ever believed and done in my life. I hope and pray these proceedings to don t make them [ordinary people] lose faith in the system. I humbly ask for mercy and compassion. Brown was convicted on 18 counts of fraud and corruption in May.The lead prosecutor in the sentencing hearing argued Thursday that the former congresswoman should be sentenced to about 7.5 to 9 years in federal prison. Her defense attorney is seeking probation and community service.Brown s defense attorney James Smith objected to various aspects of the sentencing recommendations, including how much money Brown should be culpable for.Prosecutor Duva asked the court,  What accountability does the law require?  during his presentation.Duva said Brown was accustomed to receiving money she should not have received. She also lied about donations to colleges, churches and other entities.He also argued that Brown has made ludicrous comments during the investigation, including a comment where she essentially said that had investigators not been looking into her case, the Pulse shooting in Orlando would never have happened. She also referred to the charges as  bogus  and  racist,  implying that she was targeted for her race in the case.Duva objected to that notion by saying,  She was targeted because she committed fraud, not because she was black or white. Corrine Brown had several witnesses come forward Thursday in support of her through witness testimony during the sentencing hearing.Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee provided a glowing character witness of Corrine Brown during her sentencing hearing Thursday.Jackson Lee described via telephone testimony it as her  privilege  to characterize Corrine Brown as a  loving person. She said Brown has had a  pointed and direct effort [in] helping others, not herself. The veterans  community loved Congresswoman Brown, Jackson Lee said, stating that Brown has helped those with PTSD and other issues following fighting overseas. She also stated Brown helped tremendously with relief efforts during Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. That shows a character of giving to others unselfishly,  Jackson Lee said.Additional arguments by defense attorneyThe defense attorney belabored the point that they are against the notion that Brown abused a position of trust, which is established by the evidence presented in the trial.Smith explained the definition of obstruction of justice, which Brown is accused of doing while taking the stand by the prosecutor, stating that it is the  intention or deliberate effort while on the stand to make material falsehoods. The judge wasn t so sure and asked the defense attorney to elaborate.Smith appeared to get emotional after posing two questions:  What type of sentence does justice require in this case?  and  How do you sentence someone who is a legend? He attributes some of her actions to the progress our country has made in terms of relations for black people.Smith said he met with an Orlando attorney who was from Jacksonville and said the attorney described Brown as  our Martin Luther King  for black Jacksonville natives. None of those people had to push the boulder up the mountain like she did,  said Smith, referring to others in Congress.  She truly is a legend. There are a lot of moving parts in the case against Corrine Brown and her co-conspirators.Carla Wiley first became involved in the fraud scheme when she started dating Ronnie Simmons.She was president of a charity called One Door for Education, which was never actually registered as a 501(c)(3).The fake charity received more than $800,000 in four years, with about only $1,200 of it actually going to scholarships for students. That money is now gone.Simmons was dating Wiley when he told her he needed a nonprofit to financially back a reception for congresswoman Brown in 2012. Wiley offered One Door for Education as an option for that reception.The charity claimed to give scholarships to poor and underprivileged children seeking the become teachers.Lead prosecutor A. Tysen Duva argued during the trial that Ronnie Simmons worked under Brown and did her bidding by taking out $800 a day from the One Door for Education bank account and depositing it into Brown s personal bank account. He did this numerous times, according to Duva and evidence released earlier this month.The fake charity was essentially used as a slush fund for Corrine Brown s travels, expenses and shopping, according to the prosecutors.She used the money put in her bank account to go to Nassau, Bahamas with her daughter, fly to Beverly Hills and shop along Rodeo Drive, and attend a Beyonc  concert, according to court documents and previous reports by First Coast News.The prosecutors also argued that Brown committed wire fraud, mail fraud and stole money from the government after she lied on tax documents.Brown had friends in high places, such as former CSX CEO Mike Ward. She would ask them for donation to Open Door for Education and many of them gladly donated, according to previous reports and prosecutor testimony.Ward, for instance, contributed $35,000 to One Door for Education after learning that the money would go toward providing students with iPads for learning.Prosecutors also argued that Brown lied about and inflated what she gave in tithes to various churches. The churches came forward in the trial and said the donations claimed to be given by Brown did not match their records, to which Brown said she sometimes gave anonymous donations.Other legitimate scholarship organizations came forward and said they had never received funds from Brown s charity.Meanwhile, Brown s tax returns claimed she contributed as much as $30,000   20 percent to a third of her income, to various charities.",politics,"Nov 18, 2017"
"WHOA! Is RINO Senator Mitch McConnell Behind Roy Moore Hit Job?&I strongly, strongly suspect somebody out of the McConnell camp planted the story","From the Washington Examiner   Roy Moore is the embattled Republican senatorial nominee in Alabama, but two other figures in the party have even more to lose in his race: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon.First, the obvious. If Moore is beaten by Democrat Doug Jones   a leaked National Republican Senatorial Committee poll has the socially conservative retired judge trailing Jones by 12 points, but this is at odds with public polling   McConnell will be knocked down to leading a 51-49 Republican Senate.That may not seem like much in a Senate that has no meaningful filibuster for executive and judicial appointments, but where 52 votes are no more useful for advancing legislation that can t be snuck through the reconciliation process. It is nevertheless significant given that the Senate has already had trouble passing major legislation like Obamacare repeal and tax reform with the majority it currently has.It also would bring the Democrats one vote closer to recapturing the Senate majority, despite a very daunting electoral map for the upper chamber in 2018. Winning such a reliably red state would aid Democratic candidate recruitment across the board and embolden the party s ten senators from states President Trump carried who are up for re-election next year.Superficially speaking, McConnell comes out a loser if Moore is defeated. But not in the bigger picture. The Dec. 12 special Senate election in Alabama could also be viewed as a front in the proxy war between McConnell and Bannon.After leaving the White House, Bannon threatened to recruit primary challengers for most of the incumbent Republican senators who are seeking re-election in 2018. At a joint press conference with Trump in the Rose Garden, McConnell didn t mince words about how he felt about this gambit. Look, you know, the goal here is to win elections in November,  McConnell said last month.  Back in 2010 and 2012, we nominated several candidates   Christine O Donnell, Sharron Angle, Todd Akin, Richard Mourdock. They re not in the Senate. And the reason for that was that they were not able to appeal to a broader electorate in the general election. My goal as the leader of the Republican Party in the Senate is to keep us in the majority,  he added.  The way you do that is not complicated. You have to have nominated people who can actually win, because winners make policy and losers go home. Bannon wants more Republican senators who will vote against McConnell. McConnell and his allies believe the Breitbart News chief s intervention in the primaries could lead to fewer Republican senators overall, so they have started punching back.In September s Alabama Republican primary, McConnell went all in on appointed incumbent Sen. Luther Strange and lost, despite the president s backing. Bannon made the argument that the candidate Trump endorsed wasn t the one who would be most supportive of the Trump agenda. For that, he insisted, you needed an anti-establishment candidate like Moore. Bannon, via Moore, won.Both men might have been better off with Rep. Mo Brooks, who was eliminated in the first round of voting. Brooks was big on the Trump agenda and did not have all the weird sexual baggage that could wind up dooming Moore. Bannon allies told the Washington Examiner that the former top Trump strategist might have preferred Brooks.Yet McConnell s political apparatus spent heavily against Moore to protect Strange, a sitting senator who struggled from the local perception he secured his seat through some kind of corrupt bargain with disgraced former Gov. Robert Bentley. And Bannon couldn t very well throw his weight behind a candidate who, despite being ideologically Trumpist, endorsed Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, over Trump in the 2016 primaries   especially while still serving in the West Wing.Freed from the White House, Bannon backed Moore less because the  Ten Commandments judge  had any particular affinity for the issues that Trump ran on last year and more because Alabama s political conditions made him likely to beat Strange. Moore would owe McConnell and the establishment nothing, but Bannon would have chits to cash in and an improved reputation as a kingmaker inside the GOP.If Moore loses in a disastrous fashion (and remember it is courting disaster for this race to even be competitive; in 2014, Jeff Sessions had no Democratic challenger and won over 97 percent of the vote), it will prove McConnell s point about the futility of Bannon s enterprise before the Senate majority is ever really at risk.Breitbart   American Majority founder Ned Ryun talked about Roy Moore and the Alabama Senate race with Breitbart News Executive Chairman Steve Bannon and SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam on Friday s Breitbart News Daily, broadcast live from the Restoration Weekend event.Bannon asked Ryun about celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred s involvement in the Roy Moore case, representing a woman who accuses Moore of assaulting her in 1977 when she was 16 years old.Ryan said Allred is  basically a human vulture when you look back at some of the things she s been involved in.Watch lawyer Gloria Allred, as she skirts the issue of whether or not the high school yearbook being used to prove a relationship between Judge Roy Moore and one of his accusers is a forgery:Watch forgery expert make case that Gloria Allred s client is lying about Roy Moore s signature: Remember the incident with Arnold Schwarzenegger?  Ryun asked.  She brought all these women in front of him, said they re going to sue, they re going to file suit against Schwarzenegger. Guess what? After the election, absolutely nothing happened. I think a real turning point was that press conference when they pulled out the yearbook and the signature,  he said of Allred s entry into the Moore controversy, referring to an interview with MSNBC s Katy Tur where Allred did not come off well.Ryun said this interview demonstrated that the best way to respond to sensational allegations is to  just throw facts back at them. Ryun said there was no doubt in his mind that the allegations against Moore were part of an  organized hit,  as Bannon put it. I ve been in D.C. almost 20 years. And, again, I don t have hard proof, and I will say this clearly: I do not have hard proof, but I strongly suspect it s a very short list of people, all who are associated with Mitch McConnell   whether it s Josh Holmes, whether it s Karl Rove, might even be Steven Law   I don t know, but I strongly, strongly suspect somebody out of the McConnell camp planted the story. It was planted. This came with the blessing of Mitch McConnell at some point, that he was going to take a political shot at Roy Moore,  he declared. ",politics,"Nov 18, 2017"
"ENABLING HILLARY Creates Insane Reason to Praise Serial Groper Al Franken&Bashes Trump and Moore"," ENABLING HILLARY  came to Senator Al Franken s defense on Friday during an interview for her new book, saying he should be praised for his  accountability  and willingness to apologize. The problem with this is that Franken really HAD TO apologize because he was caught red-handed. A picture of him groping a woman was evidence he made sexual groping a thing in his life.Clinton is clearly trying to play politics with this and uses it in a way that s really dirty. We know Franken is guilty Roy Moore and Donald Trump had no women prove they did anything wrong yet Clinton tries to throw President Trump and Judge Roy Moore under the bus: Speaking to WABC Radio s Rita Cosby, the former Secretary of State instead pointed the finger at President Trump and embattled GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore   claiming they should be viewed as the real predators, and not Franken:WHAT IS THIS WOMAN SMOKING: Look at the contrast between Al Franken, accepting responsibility, apologizing, and Roy Moore and Donald Trump who have done neither. That is the kind of accountability I m talking about. I don t hear that from Roy Moore or Donald Trump. A former Playboy Playmate came forward this week and accused Franken, a Democrat from Minnesota, of groping her while the two were on a USO tour in 2006. The senator offered his  sincerest apologies  on Thursday, saying he was just trying to be funny.Franken has inevitably drawn comparisons to Moore and Trump, both of whom have been accused of sexual misconduct.ALLEGATIONSWhile the president has been hit with sexual harassment allegations by numerous women in the past, Moore was only recently accused by his alleged victims in the fallout from the Harvey Weinstein scandal. BLASTING TRUMP AND MOORE The 70-year-old politician seemed to focus most of her energy on blasting Trump and Moore with these nasty and bitter comments to Cosby: Trump has disgraced the office,  she said, prompting Rita to ask whether the president had done anything in the last few months that impressed her. No. The answer is absolutely no, Rita I didn t think he d be as bad as he turned out to be. WHAT A BITTER WOMAN!Read more: NYP",politics,"Nov 17, 2017"

"ZING! Sarah Sanders Slices and Dices Hack Reporter With Awesome One-Liner [Video]","You d think reporters would learn to ask questions on policy but they obviously still want to challenge Sarah Sanders with trash talk about President Trump. April Ryan should know! She s had many run-ins with Sanders that never end well for her. The one below is no exception:Sure, April Ryan just happened to be chatting with Hillary Clinton yesterday April Ryan: I was talking to Hillary Clinton today about the president s past and she said,  Look I worry about everything from his past because it tells you how he behaves in the present and the future.  What do you say to that as it relates to these allegations of the president?And then this from Sarah:   I think Hillary Clinton probably should have dealt with some of her own issues before addressing this president.BOOM!ONE OF OUR PREVIOUS ZINGERS FROM SARAH SANDERS TO APRIL RYAN:Sarah Huckabee Sanders shut down White House reporter April Ryan during a press conference today. She said that the San Juan mayor made  zero comments  when President Donald Trump opened the table for discussion during his visit to Puerto Rico. The fake news claimed Trump didn t call on her to speak when in reality it was an open discussion that Mayor Cruz could have participated in.When Mayor Cruz joined Joy Reid on the  The Rachel Maddow show  Tuesday night. She called Trump s actions during his visit  terrible and abominable,  and criticized the round table discussion as a  PR 17-minute meeting. Huckabee Sanders responded to Ryan s question by saying the visit was not  controversial  and was in fact  widely praised, even by a Democrat Governor. She argued the Mayor of San Juan was  politicizing  the visit rather than  focusing on the relief efforts. I think that it is sad that the Mayor of San Juan chose to make that a political statement instead of a time of focusing on the relief efforts. The president invited her to be part of that conversation. He specifically asked in the meeting where many were present, including a couple dozen other mayors who were very happy with the recovery effort, the governor, the congresswoman   he opened the floor up for discussion and she actually made zero comments. The press secretary then suggested the round table discussion was her time to  weigh in and ask for what she needed  for San Juan. To me, that would have been the time and the place that she should have weighed in and asked for what she needed and laid out what she was asking for, for San Juan. She didn t,  Huckabee Sanders said.Huckabee Sanders concluded with a word of advice for the mayor. Instead, she chose to wait until the president left, and then criticized him on TV. Which I think is the wrong thing for her to do for her constituents, and I hope the next time she is given the opportunity to help her constituents, she ll take it,  she said.",politics,"Nov 17, 2017"
"WOW! IS MEGHAN MCCAIN FINISHED With The Hateful Hags of The View After Todays Blow Up With Joy Behar? [VIDEO]","It s pretty common knowledge for anyone s who s tortured themselves by watching The View, that it s really nothing more than a liberal, think-tank for dummies with too much time on their hands. Only one month ago, Meghan McCain left her job at Fox News as a co-host on  The Five  to plant herself at the end of the table, where anywhere between 4-6 angry women spend one-hour every weekday telling their viewers why they re angry, and why they hate President Trump and anyone who supports him. Thankfully for Meghan, she s the daughter of RINO Senator John McCain, one of the angriest men in politics, so she knows a thing or two about how to handle angry, and irrational people, who are driven by hate, and inspired by their desire to seek revenge. She also knows that her position at the end of the table (where the token  conservatives  are seated on The View), was likely offered to her because she was already on the anti-Trump train and didn t need any coaching.Every day, it becomes more and more obvious to the viewers that the pressure cooker relationship between unhinged co-hosts, Joy Behar and Sunny Hostin, and their hated opponent Meghan McCain won t last. If I was a betting woman, I d bet McCain is packing up her dressing room and heading back to Fox for another attempt at more intellectual discourse and meaningful dialogue by the end of this year.Watch [Fireworks start at about the 3:30-minute mark]: There s a lot of Democrats asking for [Franken] to step down if you can believe it I don t just watch Fox,  McCain said, looking at Behar.  Fox is sex harassment central,  Behar interrupted. You know what. That s so cheap. I m trying to talk about the fact that I watch other networks and people in your party are calling for the stepping down of Al Franken because of this investigation being a distraction,  a frustrated McCain shot back.Whoopi attempted to interject, before losing her words and simply exclaiming,  Well, shoot. I was responding to Joy. I just don t think that saying Fox is X, I know, I used to work there,  McCain continued.  We re talking about the present. This is what s exhausting about this conversation. I totally agree with you that it s absolutely disgusting at this point that we re still having conversations about Roy Moore. He should step down. but right now we re talking about another senator. We re also talking about hypocrisy, which is what provoked my outburst,  Behar explained.  Trump s hypocrisy, Fox s hypocrisy, Breitbart, Sean Hannity, all of them. What about the hypocrisy of Bill Clinton right now?  McCain asked, prompting Joy to ask,  Why bring up Bill Clinton at this point? It was at this point Whoopi stopped the conversation in its tracks, saying,  We re doing and we ll be right back,  before the show went to commercials.

"YEA! GOP SENATOR GOES OFF On Liberal Dem Spouting Lies About Trump Tax Plan: GIMME A BREAK! [Video]","Dem Sherrod Brown and GOP Senator Orrin Hatch go at it! They were discussing the tax plan and Hatch let Brown know he doesn t appreciate the class warfare propaganda THE MIDDLE CLASS WINS WITH TRUMP TAX PLAN:The Senate s plan to rewrite the tax code would go much further than a competing House proposal toward making good on Republican promises to focus on the middle class, a new report shows.Moderate-income people would consistently see the largest percentage declines in their tax bills, according to an analysis released late Saturday by the official, nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.In 2019, people in the middle of the income spectrum, earning between $50,000 and $70,000, would see their taxes fall by 7.1 percent. Those earning between $20,000 and $30,000 would see a 10.4 percent decline, the report shows, while millionaires would get a 5.3 percent tax cut.Unlike with the House plan, that trend holds up throughout the period over which JCT analyzed the Senate proposal. In 2027, for example, millionaires would get a 2.8 percent tax cut from the Senate plan, compared with a 6.1 percent decline for people in the middle and a 10.3 percent reduction for those earning between $20,000 and $30,000.How Republicans  tax plans would affect people in different income groups has been a hotly contested issue in Congress, with the GOP contending its plans are aimed at the middle class while Democrats call them a giveaway to the rich.The House proposal would have a muddled impact on people in different income groups, JCT found earlier this month. At first, modest-income people would be its biggest winners, but the outlook changes after the first few years. Some modest-income people would face tax increases under the House plan, JCT found, and by 2027, millionaires would be its biggest winners.The analysis of the Senate plan, which the Finance Committee plans to formally take up on Monday, shows people in every income cohort receiving a tax cut on average, though it did not examine whether some people within those groups would face tax increases.",politics,"Nov 17, 2017"
"WATCH: UNCOVERED VIDEO REVEALS Dan Rather Saying Americans Are Bored With Bill Clinton Rape Story&Want To Move On To The Next Thing","In one of his regular appearances on the Imus In The Morning radio show, Dan Rather was asked by Imus in 1999, if he had any idea why NBC News was sitting on the story about the rape charges against Bill Clinton by Juanita Broaddrick?   Rather responded that the reason they were  sitting on the story  was  pretty obvious.  First, Rather clarified that they don t call to tell him why or why not they choose to hide a story from their news channel, but suggested:  I think it s pretty obvious that they re nervous about, number one, whether this information is accurate, whether it s really true or not. And number two, even if it does turn out to be true, it happened a long time ago, and number three, they ve got to be figuring that maybe, just maybe the American public has heard all that they want to hear about it and they re saying,  next , let s move on to the next thing. Imus went on to say that he read an article in either the leftist propaganda Newsweek or Time magazine that  even the woman herself, Juanita Broaddrick said she hoped that this thing went away this week, and even she was sick of hearing about it, [Dan Rather interrupted Imus with laughter] and it s her story.  Dan Rather then busted out in laughter and agreed, saying,  Well let s hope she gets her way with that.  More laughter Imus then revealed that  Someone from NBC News told me that she wasn t clear about when exactly this thing happened, but then her son called me and he s an attorney someplace, in, I guess in Arkansas, and he wanted me to know, why he called me god knows, but he wanted me to know that that was not the case, that she knows exactly what it was, and there was some other reason they were sitting on it. Instead of responding to Imus  comments, Rather deflected by making an embarrassing play to stroke Imus  ego and distract him from the reason NBC hiding the Clinton rape story. Rather continued,  But I just don t know if this is going anywhere, you know, I d have to bet for the moment that it isn t. The Washington Post gave it a pretty good ride on Saturday, and there wasn t much pick up from it.

They ve also been caught telling some huge whoppers on air that social media calls them out on. Blatant lies about President Trump caused him to go after the network with the nickname of  fake news . Well, it stuck and now they are known as  FNN  aka Fake News Network.Jaxon Jester wanted to boldly wear a  FNN  t-shirt for a field trip to Atlanta s CNN headquarters but his teacher made him take the shirt off His right to freedom of speech was violated and the entire incident has raised questions about who did the right thing: UNDER FIRE A Georgia family is under fire for allowing a seventh grader to wear a T-shirt that mocked liberal news network CNN on a school field trip to CNN s Atlanta headquarters   but the boy s parents think the school violated the First Amendment by making their son take it off.Nancy and Stan Jester, of Dekalb, are both local elected officials, she a county commissioner and he is a member of the local school board. Their son, seventh-grader Jaxon, wore a shirt mocking the CNN logo as  FNN  with the caption,  Fake News Network. A teacher asked him to remove it before the tour, but the school has since apologized to the Jesters. However, the parents want an apology for Jaxon because, they say, the whole thing was his idea and he has the right to free speech. This year when the CNN tour was announced, my 7th grade son Jaxon asked me if he could purchase an FNN-Fake News Network shirt to wear for his field trip,  Stan Jester wrote in a blog post.  As an advocate for the First Amendment, I agreed to his request. Jester continued:  His mother cautioned him that he might cause a controversy and needed to be prepared for that. He was fully aware of the implications of his decision and made the affirmative choice to wear his shirt. The boy s father wrote that he is  disappointed by the hypocrisy  of the decision to make his son change his shirt.

"DEMOCRAT SENATOR AL FRANKEN Thought It Would Be Hilarious To Do An SNL Skit About Drugging and Raping 60 Minutes Reporter: when Lesleys passed out, I take her to the closet and rape her","Democratic Senator Al Franken   who has been accused of kissing a woman without her consent and pretending to grope her in a photo   once pitched an SNL sketch about raping a journalist, it has emerged.The remarks were made in 1995, when Franken and other writers on the show were working up a sketch about then-60 Minutes host Andy Rooney finding a bottle of pills in his desk, New York Magazine reported at the time.As the team batted ideas around, Franken suggested that the pills might be used by Rooney to drug Lesley Stahl at which point he would  take her to the closet and rape her .The sketch was part of an ongoing series in which Norm Macdonald portrayed Rooney as an out-of-touch misanthrope with a tenuous grasp on reality.Macdonald had suggested that Rooney could say  I don t know what the pills are for   what I do know is, the bottle is mostly filled with cotton. Franken then chipped in with:  And,  I give the pills to Lesley Stahl. Then, when Lesley s passed out, I take her to the closet and rape her. Or,  That s why you never see Lesley until February.  Or,  When she passes out, I put her in various positions and take pictures of her. Stahl was a contributor to 60 Minutes at the time. Macdonald then asked,  What if Rooney rapes Mike Wallace? And then says,  I guess that makes me bad.  Is it funnier with a black guy? Or two old white guys? Franken responded:  What about,  I drag Mike into my office and rape him. Right here! I guess that makes me bad. The sketch never made it to air, and it s questionable whether it was ever intended to do so.But the 1995 report has now resurfaced   as it did in 2008, when Franken made his successful run for Minnesota Senator.At the time, his campaign said:  Al understands, and the people of Minnesota understand, the difference between what a satirist does and what a senator does. But newly emerged claims that Franken kissed a woman without her consent in 2006, and pretended to grope her in a photo while she was sleeping have been tougher for the comedian to address.

Delusional!Hillary s delusional reasoning:  If they send a signal that we re going to be like some dictatorship, like some authoritarian regime, where political opponents are going to be unfairly, fraudulently investigated, that rips at the fabric of the contract we have, that we can trust our justice system   It will be incredibly demoralizing to people who have served at the Justice Department, under both Republicans and Democrats, because they know better. But it will also send a terrible signal to our country and the world that somehow we are giving up on the kind of values that we used to live by and we used to promote worldwide. Here s the latest on just how corrupt Hillary really is and why she s pushing back she s guilty!This is why she s saying this is an  abuse of power Guilty!!!The Uranium One corruption runs so deep with the Obama administration that it is a threat to Obama too. This corruption must be investigated! This is the real Russian scandal!The videos above provide so much information and proof that this is a crime If this doesn t warrant a special counsel, what the heck does ?Here are the seven facts about the Uranium One deal you need to know: Peter Schweizer Broke the Uranium One Scandal Government Accountability Institute (GAI) President and Breitbart News Senior Editor-at-Large Peter Schweizer broke the Uranium One scandal in his book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich. In the book, he reported that Clinton s State Department, along with other federal agencies, approved the transfer of 20 percent of all U.S. uranium to Russia and that nine foreign investors in the deal gave $145 million to Hillary and Bill Clinton s personal charity, the Clinton Foundation. The New York Times Confirmed the Scandal in 2015 The New York Times confirmed Schweizer s Uranium One revelations in a 4,000-word front-page story by a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter. It detailed how the Russian energy giant Rosatom had taken over the Canadian firm with three separate purchases between 2009 and 2013, largely coinciding with Hillary Clinton s time as secretary of state. The FBI Uncovered Evidence that Russian Money Was Funneled to the Clinton Foundation The Hill reported last week that ahead of the deal, the FBI had uncovered  substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering  to expand Russia s nuclear footprint in the U.S. as early as 2009. The agency also found that Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. to benefit the Clinton Foundation. The Justice Department would sit on the evidence for four years before looking to prosecute, by which time the deal had been approved. Congress Is Now Investigating The Senate Judiciary Committee has launched a probe into the scandal and has sent requests for more information to 10 federal agencies involved in the approval of the partial sale of Uranium One, asking what they knew about the FBI investigation and when. Bill Clinton Was Paid $500,000 for a Speech in Moscow Bill Clinton bagged a $500,000 speech in Moscow paid for by a Kremlin-backed bank shortly after Russia announced its intention to take a majority stake in the company. According to the Times, Clinton traveled to Moscow in June 2010, the same month Rosatom struck its deal for its majority stake in Uranium One. The Clinton Foundation Took Big Bucks from Uranium Investors According to theTimes, The Clinton Foundation received $2.35 million in donations from Ian Telfer, a mining investor who was also the chairman of Uranium One when Rosatom acquired it. It also received $31.3 million and a pledge for $100 million more from Frank Giustra, the Canadian mining financier whose company merged with Uranium One. Senate Republicans Want an FBI Gag Order Lifted Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-IA) has called for the Justice Department to lift the gag order on the FBI s whistleblower, indicating that he may have more explosive revelations related to the case and on what the Clintons and the Obama administration knew about the case and when they knew it.

And that is a question that is left open still unanswered. and secondly, have you ever heard of anyone putting $145 million, at one moment, into the hands of the Clinton foundation? And the answer is, of course not. These questions, most basic and fundamental, were armed by the very committee made up of the very agencies, departments, and individuals responsible for national security. this, this is the biggest Obama scandal. I think it may well turn out to be the biggest scandal in American political history. ",politics,"Nov 16, 2017"

"FORMER JOE BIDEN Secret Service Agent Claims They Had to Protect Women From Him&Biden would grope all of our wives and girlfriends a**es","Several uncomfortable videos have surfaced this week, showing former Vice President Joe Biden groping little girls. Apparently, according to a former secret service agent, Vice President Joe Biden is not only interested in touching little girls in inappropriate ways, he s also someone the Secret Service felt they needed to protect from their female agents.Here s one example of Creepy Joe touching and rubbing a little girl who is clearly uncomfortable with his inappropriate actions:Big League Politics  Cassandra Fairbanks dropped a bombshell report on Gateway Pundit, where she released a stunning report from a former Secret Service agent assigned to the Vice President Joe Biden residence claims that the Service often had to protect female agents from him.Speaking on the condition of anonymity, the agent asserted that,  We had to cancel the VP Christmas get together at the Vice President s house because Biden would grope all of our wives and girlfriend s asses.  The annual party was for agents and Navy personnel who were tasked with protecting the Biden family. He would mess with every single woman or teen. It was horrible,  the agent said.According to the source, a Secret Service agent once got suspended for a week in 2009 for shoving Biden after he cupped his girlfriend s breast while the couple was taking a photo with him. The situation got so heated, the source told Cassandra Fairbanks, that others had to step in to prevent the agent from hitting the then-Vice President.Additionally, the agent claims that Biden would walk around the VP residence naked at night.  I mean, Stark naked  Weinstein level stuff,  he added.He said that the men on duty would frequently stand in front of female agents and Navy women that were present  like a damn guardian.  On some occasions, they would make up reasons to get the women away from where he was.The agent said he was specifically concerned about women in the Navy. They weren t allowed to disobey him at all, but we d take them away under pretend auspices,  the agent stated.Best-selling author Ronald Kessler wrote about Biden s problem with female agents in his book The First Family Detail.Go to the 2:00-minute mark to hear Kessler tell Sean Hannity how Vice President Joe Biden likes to swim naked in front of female secret service agents:Next time you hear the liberal media talking about how Judge Roy Moore should step down from his bid to become Alabama s next US Senator, with absolutely no evidence that he has ever even made a teenage girl feel uncomfortable  remember the actual videos of Joe Biden, the so-called future of the Democrat Party, groping numerous little girls in plain view of the media, and of the little girls families, while everyone tried to pretend it wasn t happening.

"UCLA PLAYERS Hold Press Conference&Finally Thank President Trump! [Video]","The three UCLA basketball freshmen arrested for shoplifting in China thanked President Donald Trump for his assistance and expressed remorse for their actions in a brief press conference on Wednesday.LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley, and Jalen Hill were arrested on Nov. 8 after being accused of stealing designer sunglasses in Hangzhou, and they faced potentially stiff prison sentences.Trump learned of the saga while in Beijing, and he asked Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping to intercede. The players, who had been traveling with their team and were detained in their hotel in Hangzhou, were allowed to return to Los Angeles, and the PAC-12 conference released a statement that the matter had been resolved to the satisfaction of Chinese authorities.Trump tweeted earlier Wednesday about the saga, wondering seemingly sarcastically whether the players would thank him, saying,  they were headed for 10 years in jail! The players each spoke in turn, all stating they regretted their actions and apologizing. Riley sighed deeply after mentioning Trump. To President Trump and the United States government, thank you for taking the time to intervene on our behalf. We really appreciate you helping us out,  he said before sighing.Ball said he had exercised poor judgment and said he had been raised better than his actions showed. I would also like to thank President Trump and the United States government for the help that they provided as well,  Ball said.Hill said he hoped the saga would help him become a better person and also thanked Trump and the government for their intercession.UCLA head coach Steve Alford has said the three freshmen are  indefinitely suspended  from the program for their conduct.

"WOW! WATCH: CREEPY JOE BIDEN Just Cant Keep His Hands (Or Body) Off Senator Kelly Ayottes 6-Yr Old Daughter","Yesterday, we posted videos of  Creepy Joe Biden  rubbing his hands all over the upper bodies of little girls whose parents or grandparents were present, while photographers and videographers were snapping photos and capturing footage of the uncomfortable interactions.Joe Biden didn t earn his nickname  Creepy Joe  or  Creepy Uncle Joe  for his good behavior. Sadly,  Creepy Joe  earned his nickname after he was caught numerous times groping women and young girls on camera. Of course, the media gives Joe Biden a pass, because he s a Democrat, and if there s anything we ve learned over the past 4 decades, it s that high-profile members of the Democrat Party, like accused rapist Bill Clinton, can t be held accountable for their  playful  sexual advances towards women, and in the especially creepy Joe Biden s case, young girls.The video below is a perfect example of how Democrats have been allowed to blatantly abuse their power for decades, while both parties and the media look the other way. In 2011, Kelly Ayotte was being sworn in by Vice President Joe Biden. The video starts with Joe Biden standing alone when Ayotte s little 6-year old daughter Kate, catches his eye. Like a moth to the light, Biden seeks her out.  Who is that beautiful child? Biden asks. Biden then turns around and appears to be looking to see if anyone is watching him as he approaches her. Kate s mother, Kelly Ayotte rushes over when she sees Biden attempting to interact with her daughter and tells her to  come on out  from hiding. Biden strikes up a conversation with Kelly Ayotte while stroking the head of her toddler son and talking in a weird hushed tone. All the while, Biden appears to be keeping his eye on the prize (Ayotte s daughter Kate). Meanwhile, Ayotte s husband appears to be having a private conversation with his daughter when Biden, who can t help himself, moves over closer to the dad, shakes his hand and for no apparent reason, tells her father that  She can have whatever she wants.  Biden then attempts to strike up a conversation with the little girl, asking her,  How old are you? . When it appears the Ayotte family is ready for the swearing-in ceremony, Biden begins to direct the family, as to where they are to stand. He makes what appears to be a calculated decision for the little girl to stand next to him. Biden then proceeds to grind his groin area into the little girl over and over. The little girl is visibly uncomfortable in the video. Biden can be seen strangely stroking the head and hair of Ayotte s daughter as he swears Kelly Ayotte in the US Senate.As the Ayotte family attempts to leave the swearing-in ceremony, the cringe-worthy VP pulls the little Ayotte girl back into him and leans in to whisper dating advice in her ear (for the second time). As Joe leans in, he begins to stroke her head with both hands and leans down to kiss the little girl he just met on the head. Little 6-yr. old Kate is clearly uncomfortable with his unwanted mauling. Joe appears to be very accomplished at making small talk, especially about his own young grandchildren, which is likely a great way to deflect the parent s suspicion from him while he strokes the heads and bodies, young girls. The stroking of her hair and rubbing of Kate s body with his hands continues for much too long before the Ayotte family finally exits the room, at which time, Biden looks around and asks if anyone else wants to be sworn in (hopefully, with young children in tow).Watch:Go HERE to see more cringe-worthy Joe Biden videos.h/t GP ",politics,"Nov 15, 2017"

Today, Beverly Young Nelson s son Darrel Nelson made a public Facebook video to let America know he s behind Judge Roy Moore and that believes his stepmother is not telling the truth about Judge Moore sexually assaulting her when she was a teen.Here is part of his transcript:Good evening. As I said today, I found out today, that my stepmother is one of the ladies that s accusing Judge Moore of an act that supposedly happened when she was a teenager. My father s name is John Allen Nelson. The woman that s committed this act against Mr. Moore, is Beverly Young Nelson. It s hard for me to actually have this conversation, but it must be done. Mr. Moore, I support you. I don t believe the acts that she s claimed you ve done. I don t believe it. I ve known the woman, she married my father many, many years ago, I ve known her for a while now, and I truly do not believe that she s being honest about this. You re a good judge. I ve growed up, I ve known your name since I was a kid. You cared about the ten commandments. You tried like hell to keep the ten commandments from being taken out of the courthouse. I remember. I ve been a member of Etowah County my whole life. I was born here. Now I m twisted. To you Mr. Moore, and to your wife, I do apologize. For whatever reason, she s doing this, and I am truly sorry. I stand behind you 100%. And to my stepmother, for whatever reasons you did this Why did you, I have a few questions about this: Why did you wait so long if this did happen? You waited, you said you were a teenager when it happened. Well, here it now, how many years later? And all of a sudden, now you re gonna bring it up when he s fixin  to go, and we done votin  him into the House, and you re trying to get him took out.

I know I m gonna get some backlash from my family, but that s okay. We the people made the decision. It s over. Democrats are taking a shot at it, using any and everybody they can get so they can tarnish his record, to get a Democrat to take his place. Well, I m sorry. We re not gonna have that. For whatever reason, she s done what she s done. This needs to end now. So with this official statement, I stand with Moore, all the way. I m reaching out to you Mr. Moore.

"FIREWORKS: TREY GOWDY Confronts Jeff Sessions at Congressional Hearing: How do you restore peoples trust? [Video]","Trey Gowdy railed against the erosion of trust between the American people and the DOJ during a hearing before Congress today:  I want to start with something that s very important to me,  Gowdy began,  and I think it s important to all people in this country of good conscience, irrespective of their political ideation, and that s the independence of the Department of Justice. In my judgment, 2016 and 2017 have been challenging years for the Department of Justice. Gowdy then went into the various legal procedures for charging citizens, including political players like Hillary Clinton and former FBI director James Comey. Mr. Conyers asked you whether or not it was appropriate for the president to weigh in on an ongoing investigation,  Gowdy said.  And of course, the answer to that is  no.  It is not appropriate. It s not appropriate in 2017. It wasn t appropriate when President Obama did it in the IRS targeting scandal. It wasn t appropriate when President Obama did it in the ongoing investigation into Hillary Clinton s server. It is never appropriate for a president to tell a Department of Justice what outcome it would reach. I just wish my friends on the other side of the aisle would have the same kind of outrage when President Obama did it as they do now.  Then Gowdy asked a  last question. How do you restore people s trust   Republicans and Democrats   confidence in a Department of Justice when it seems like different rules apply depending on who s in power?  he asked.Attorney General Sessions gave a direct answer. Well, it s a good question and important question,  Sessions responded.  We intend to do our work, according to the established principles of the Department of Justice. We will not be infected by politics or bias. We will only make decisions we believe are right and just. We re not going to unlawfully use the department to advance a political agenda  I am determined that when the years go by, that people will say this Department of Justice did not crumble.

Bush groped her when she was just 16 years old.According to Corrigan, the groping occurred in November of 2003 at an event in The Woodlands, Texas. This is the sixth woman to publicly accuse the 41st president of grabbing her butt without consent.Speaking to Time magazine, Corrigan, who is now in her early 30s, said,  My initial action was absolute horror. I was really, really confused. The first thing I did was look at my mom and, while he was still standing there, I didn t say anything,  she said.  What does a teenager say to the ex-president of the United States? Like,  Hey dude, you shouldn t have touched me like that? Like the other five incidents, Corrigan claims it happened when she was posing with Bush for a photograph. Bush was then 79 years old. As soon as the picture was being snapped on the one-two-three he dropped his hands from my waist down to my buttocks and gave it a nice, ripe squeeze, which would account for the fact that in the photograph my mouth is hanging wide open,  Corrigan told Time.  I was like,  Oh my goodness, what just happened?    Breitbart ",politics,"Nov 13, 2017"
"JUDGE ROY MOORE BLASTS Latest Accusers Press Conference With Same Liberal Lawyer Who Tried To Take Down Trump: I Dont Even Know The Woman","Even though the media and the their allies in the Democrat Party are maniacly focused on doing whatever it takes to bring down the popular Alabama GOP Senate candidate, only one month before the election, Judge Roy Moore still has a sizable lead in the most recent polls.Accusations from four decades ago, by women that range from a woman who worked for Hillary and promotes Democrat candidate for Senate, Doug Ross on Facebook, to a woman who has a history of accusing several pastors of sexual misconduct are suddenly coming out of the woodwork.One of Moore s accusers, Leigh Corfman apparently has a history of claiming pastors made sexual advances on her.Purportedly Moore s main accuser Leigh Corfman has had three divorces, filed for bankruptcy three times, and has been charged with multiple misdemeanors.Posts on Moore's FB page indicate that Corfman, has claimed several pastors at various churches made sexual advances at her.  James Hirsen (@thejimjams) November 10, 2017Another one of Moore s accusers Debbie Wesson Gibson wasn t clever enough to delete postings from her Facebook page that show she s a Hillary supporter, she hates President Trump and oh yeah, she asks her friends (more than once) to vote for Moore s Democrat opponent, Doug Ross.Today, leftist media whore, Gloria Allred marched another accuser, Beverly Young Nelson, out in front of the cameras with a four decades old story about how she was sexually assaulted by Roy Moore. This time, however, Roy Moore, and his wife Kayla are not just sitting back and watching his reputation be destroyed by the liberal machine. Watch, as Moore and his wife come out swinging, at the lies being told by the latest accuser. Roy Moore tells the crowd of his supporters and the media,  I don t even know the woman. I don t even know where the restaurant was or is. :Alabama Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore and his wife, Kayla Moore, react to new sexual misconduct allegations brought against him by an Alabama woman, Beverly Young Nelson, who claims Moore assaulted her when she was 16 years old pic.twitter.com/FSJlntUant  Breaking911 (@Breaking911) November 14, 2017Moore s wife Kayla, who is planning to sue the Washington Post, reminded her friends on Facebook that the media whore lawyer Gloria Allred tried the same stunt with Donald Trump only months before the election:Gloria Allred is currently under two separate bar investigations for alleged misconduct:Anti-Trump Celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred is under two bar investigations https://t.co/OzbyYWaHLD via @MailOnline  Jim Hoft (@gatewaypundit) November 13, 2017Yesterday, this letter was published by dozens of pastors, who came to the defense of Judge Roy Moore:Pastor s LetterDear friends and fellow Alabamians, For decades, Roy Moore has been an immovable rock in the culture wars   a bold defender of the  little guy,  a just judge to those who came before his court, a warrior for the unborn child, defender of the sanctity of marriage, and a champion for religious liberty. Judge Moore has stood in the gap for us, taken the brunt of the attack, and has done so with a rare, unconquerable resolve. As a consequence of his unwavering faith in God and his immovable convictions for Biblical principles, he was ousted as Chief Justice in 2003. As a result, he continued his life pursuit by starting the Foundation for Moral Law, which litigates religious liberty cases around our Nation. After being re-elected again to Chief Justice in 2012, by an overwhelming majority, he took another round of persecution for our faith as he stood up for the sanctity of marriage between one man and one woman. You can know a man by his enemies, and he s made plenty   from the radical organizations such as the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ACLU to the liberal media and a handful of establishment politicians from Washington. He has friends too, a lot of them. They live all across this great State, work hard all week, and fill our pews on Sunday. They know him as a father, a grandfather, a man who loves God s Word and knows much of it by heart, a man who cares for the people, a man who understands our Constitution in the tradition of our Founding Fathers, and a man who deeply loves America. It s no wonder the Washington establishment has declared all-out war on his campaign. We are ready to join the fight and send a bold message to Washington: dishonesty, fear of man, and immorality are an affront to our convictions and our Savior and we won t put up with it any longer. We urge you to join us at the polls to cast your vote for Roy Moore.

"LOL! KEURIG CEO APOLOGIZES After Customers Boycott and SMASH Coffee Makers&Unfortunately, The Apology Isnt For Keurig Customers","When Keurig decided to side with Soros against Sean Hannity and Roy Moore s right to defend himself against serious, and shady sex allegations, they released a genie that they re not going to be able to put back in the bottle Three days ago, a Twitter user by the name of Angelo Carusone tried to shame Keurig for adverising on the Sean Hannity Show after Sean interviewed the Repbulican Alabama Senate candidate, Roy Moore, allowing him to tell his side of the story, after 4 women came forward 4 decades later to announce that he sexually abused them when they were teens. The stories of at least 2 of his accusers have been unraveling after non-mainstream media uncovered that one of the anti-Trump accusers worked for Hillary and openly promoted Moore s Democrat opponent on her Facebook page. The mother of another accuser is challenging the truth behind the Washington Post s hit story as well.Curiously, the person who sent the tweet that Keurig responded to is none other than Angelo Carusone, the president of GEORGE SOROS  Media Matters of America.

"SOMALI IMMIGRANT Charged With Multiple Stabbings At Mall of America Has Interesting Meaning Behind His Islamic Name","Minnesota is home to the largest number of Somali immigrants in America.  Census numbers put the state s Somali s population at about 40,000, but community activists have said it s higher. The largest share of that group has settled in the Minneapolis area, including one neighborhood near the University of Minnesota campus that s been dubbed  Little Mogadishu.  But significant numbers have also settled in St. Cloud, Willmar and other smaller cities.Being home to the largest number of Somali immigrants in America doesn t come without a price WND   For the second time in just over a year, a Somali  refugee  has stabbed shoppers with a knife at a Minnesota mall.The first case, on Sept. 17, 2016, was a clear act of jihad when Dahir Adan injured 10 people in the Macy s at the Crossroads Center Mall in St. Cloud after asking his victims, chosen at random, if they were Muslim.But on Sunday night a man identified as Mahad Abdiaziz Abdirahman, 20, of Minneapolis stabbed two men at the Mall of America after they tried to stop him from stealing clothes inside the dressing room at Macy s.His middle name, Abdiaziz, means  the slave of Allah the master,  a native Arabic speaker told WND.His first name, Mahad, means  the one who preaches and invites people to Islam. Wow! Talk about the perfect ambassdor for Islam According to the NYP, Abdirahaman sneaked into a men s fitting room at the Minnesota mall and tried to swipe something from a customer s belongings while the man was outside the fitting room modeling clothes for his family. But he caught Abdirahaman in the act, and the would-be thief pulled a knife and stabbed him, authorities said.Hearing the victim s screams, his family rushed to his aid, but Abdirahaman slashed a second person before they could wrest the knife from him.The scuffle and ensuing response by police freaked out nearby shoppers waiting in line for their kids to see Santa.Violence by Somali immigrants against Minneapolis residents is nothing new to people who have watched the Somali population explode in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area.Last year, we reported about a mob of up to 30 young Somali men paraded through one of Minneapolis  more upscale neighborhoods last week, yelling disparaging comments and threats against homeowners.A female resident of the neighborhood, obviously shaken in a TV interview, related how she was screamed at by a Somali man who threatened to kidnap and rape her. They were screaming at the house that they were going to kidnap you and they were going to rape you,  one Minneapolis resident told KSTP TV.  It was a very traumatizing experience. Somalis living in Minneapolis are almost all Sunni Muslims, and residents of the Lake Calhoun area say this isn t the first time a group of Somali men has made an intimidating march through their neighborhood, which is filled with million-dollar homes.Go HERE for video to see homeowner tell her horrifying story.

"JUST IN: Anti-Putin Banker Claims Firm Tied To Clinton Campaign Assisted Russians In Effort To Have Me Imprisoned And Killed","One of the many targets of the opposition research firm Fusion GPS is accusing them of assisting the Kremlin in its effort to have him  imprisoned and killed. The strong allegation comes from Bill Browder, a London-based banker who spearheaded the Magnitsky Act, a sanctions law vehemently opposed by the Russian government.Browder made the allegation in response to the recent revelation that Fusion GPS and its founder Glenn Simpson compiled what he says is false information about him that was given to Yuri Chaika, Russia s prosecutor general, and to Donald Trump Jr. during the infamous June 2016 Trump Tower meeting. If it is true that Glenn Simpson was supplying information about me to the Russian government, it s far more serious than smear campaigning or Foreign Agents Registration Act violations,  said Browder, the head of Hermitage Capital. It would mean that Simpson was assisting the Putin regime in their plot to get me back to Russia to have me imprisoned and killed.It was previously known that the Washington, D.C-based Fusion GPS s investigation of Browder was beneficial to the Russian government and its effort to reverse the Magnitsky Act. But it was revealed only last week that information Fusion collected on Browder was shared directly with Chaika, whose position is the Russian equivalent of the U.S. attorney general.Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian attorney who attended the Trump Tower meeting, is who provided both Chaika and Trump Jr. with the Fusion-generated information on Browder. She took a four-page report into the June 9, 2016 Trump Tower meeting, which was attended by Jared Kushner and then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort.Veselnitskaya worked with Simpson, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, on the anti-Browder project. Reuters reported on Thursday that Simpson compiled the research for the Trump Tower memo. And NBC News reported on Friday that similar research put together by Simpson was given by Veselnitskaya to Chaika in Oct. 2015.Browder, who was born in Chicago but is a British citizen, is a target of the Kremlin s ire because of his role in pushing through the Magnitsky Act, which passed Congress in 2012. The Russian government recently issued an Interpol arrest in an attempt to apprehend Browder. Vladimir Putin reportedly approved the move against the 53-year-old money manager, who wrote a book about his travails called  Red Notice,  a reference to the term used for Interpol warrants.Fusion GPS, which is based in Washington, D.C., became involved in the Browder matter after being hired by BakerHostetler, a law firm representing Denis Katsyv, a Russian businessman who faced penalties because of the Magnitsky Act.Simpson worked closely on the investigation with the Moscow-based Veselnitskaya, who represents Katsyv and his firm, Prevezon Holdings.Veselnitskaya s affiliation with Simpson is one of the stranger story lines arising from both the Trump Tower meeting and the dossier, which was funded by the Clinton campaign and DNC.Theories have circulated that Fusion GPS arranged the Trump Tower meeting in order to compromise the Trump campaign or that Simpson relayed details of the meeting provided by Veselnitskaya to Christopher Steele, the former British spy who wrote the dossier.Fusion was being paid for its dossier work at the same time it was being paid by BakerHostetler to investigate Browder.Adding even more fuel to those theories was a report this week that Simpson and Veselnitskaya met just before and just after she attended the Trump Tower session:BUSTED! MEETING BETWEEN FUSION GPS AND RUSSIAN LAWYER BEFORE AND AFTER:The co-founder of Fusion GPS, the firm behind the unverified Trump dossier, met with a Russian lawyer before and after a key meeting she had last year with Trump Jr. The contacts shed new light on how closely tied the firm was to Russian interests, at a time when it was financing research to discredit then-candidate Donald Trump.The opposition research firm has faced renewed scrutiny after litigation revealed that the DNC and Hillary Clinton s campaign paid for that research. Congressional Republicans have since questioned whether that politically financed research contributed to the FBI s investigation of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign   making Fusion s 2016 contacts with Russian interests all the more relevant.DNC MONEY FUNNELED THROUGH LAW FIRM TO FUSION GPS?The June 2016 Trump Tower meeting involving Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya occurred during a critical period. Bank records show Fusion GPS was paid by a law firm for work on behalf of a Kremlin-linked oligarch while paying a former British spy Christopher Steele to dig up dirt on Trump through his Russian contacts.But hours before the Trump Tower meeting on June 9, 2016, Fusion co-founder and ex-Wall Street Journal reporter Glenn Simpson was with Veselnitskaya in a Manhattan federal courtroom. Court records show email correspondence and published reports corroborate the pair s presence together. They also were together after the Trump Tower meeting.Read more: Fox NewsRead more: Daily Caller",politics,"Nov 13, 2017"

"TWO NEW POLLS Offer BAD NEWS For Democrats&.Why Washington Posts HIT JOB On Roy Moore May Have Backfired","Last week, the Washington Post reported that after almost 4 decades, 4 women came forward to claim they were sexually abused as teenagers, by Roy Moore, the GOP candidate for senator in Alabama. Nevermind that for 4 decades they were silent about Moore s alleged behavior, and that only 4 weeks before the election, they all decided to confide in the leftist rag who just endorsed Moore s Democrat opponent, Doug Ross for Senate.It was discovered last week that one of the women who accused Roy Moore of sexual misconduct actually worked for Hillary as a  signer  at her campaign, openly trashed President Trump and pushed her friends to support Moore s opponent on her personal Facebook page.Meanwhile, the allegations against Moore continue to unravel, as the mother of Leigh Corfman, who says that Alabama Senatorial Candidate Roy Moore tried to engage in a sexual encounter with her when she was 14, told Breitbart News that the Washington Post worked to convince her daughter to give an interview about the allegations against Moore. Speaking by phone to Breitbart News on Saturday, Corfman s mother, Nancy Wells, 71, further stated that her daughter would not have come forward if it weren t for The Post reporter s alleged actions.Earlier on Sunday, Breitbart News reported that Corfman s mother contradicted a key detail of Corfman s story. Speaking by phone to Breitbart News on Saturday, Wells said that her daughter did not have a phone in her bedroom during the period that Moore is reported to have allegedly called Corfman   purportedly on Corfman s bedroom phone   to arrange at least one encounter.The Washington Post cited Corfman as remembering that she provided Moore with her number when she was 14. She said that she spoke to Moore from what she described as the phone in her bedroom.Today, the left got some very bad new about their hit job on Roy Moore it appears that polls show Alabama voters aren t buying it Breitbart News   Two new polls demonstrate that GOP nominee for the U.S. Senate Judge Roy Moore remains unaffected entirely by smears in the Washington Post against him, and his lead before the Post piece on Thursday afternoon remains intact. One of the polls, which were both provided by the pollster to Breitbart News exclusively on Saturday evening, was conducted on Thursday morning before the publication of the Post piece that afternoon. The second one was conducted on Saturday evening. Together, they show Judge Moore s lead over Democrat Doug Jones has been virtually unaffected since the Post story came out.The first survey, which was conducted entirely before noon local time on Thursday, shows Moore leading Jones by 50 percent to 39.2 percent with 10.8 percent undecided. That survey of 1,354 likely voters in the upcoming Dec. 12 special election has a margin of error of 3.5 percent.The second survey, conducted Saturday evening two days after the Post piece hit, roiling Alabama s political scene shows Moore and Jones with about the exact same percentages as before. Moore s position in this second poll is 49.8 percent meaning he only dropped 0.2 percent since the story hit and Jones has only picked up 0.4 percent to reach 39.6 percent total. The second survey, which polled 1,536 likely voters with a margin of error of 3.3 percent, has 10.5 percent as undecided. The polling between Thursday morning and Saturday showed far less movement than I originally expected,  pollster John Wahl told Breitbart News.  The controversy surrounding the Washington Post article seems to have galvanized the support of both candidates, but not changed the actual percentages in a significant manner. The Moore campaign has already weathered a considerable amount of political attacks during this campaign season, and I expect most of his lightest support to have blown off during these attacks. His current support level is holding fairly steady. Another liberal publication, The Hill, reported that Moore was losing in the polls to Jones after the hit piece on Moore was published in the Washington Post.The Hill -Democrat Doug Jones is leading Republican Roy Moore in Alabama s Senate race in the wake of explosive accusations of sexual misconduct against Moore, according to a new poll released Sunday.Forty-six percent of likely voters polled said they would vote for Jones, while 42 percent said they would vote for Moore, according to the Louisiana-based JMC Analytics and Polling.The survey was conducted on Nov. 9 and Nov. 11, after The Washington Post reported that a woman said Moore had initiated a sexual encounter with her in 1979, when she was 14 years old and he was 32.The RealClearPolitics poll has Moore and Jones tied. The poll showing Moore losing to Jones was conducted by JMP, the same polling operation who gave us this hilariously inaccurate poll, only one week before the general election in 2016:We re gonna go out on a limb, and say that this so-called scandal involving Judge Roy Moore is going to backfire spectacularly on the left, and will ultimately only shine a spotlight on the hypocrisy of the Democrat Party, who ignored the sexual misconduct of former President Bill Clinton and his enabling wife, Hillary Clinton for decades.

"REPUBLICAN LEADER Implies He May Not Seat Roy Moore If He Wins Election","The New York Times just confirmed what we ve all known since Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell threw his support to Luther Strange in the Alabama primary The GOP will do anything it can to stop Judge Moore from becoming a US Senator. A report at the New York Times indicates that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., may not seat Moore even if he wins the election. Moreover, Republican elites are trying to get the election pushed back. The Republicans have pulled funds from Judge Moore even though there is no proof he s guilty of these charges. It s an obvious sandbagging of a candidate the Republican swamp creatures and Democrats don t like.According to the New York Times:Republican senators and their advisers, in a flurry of phone calls, emails and text messages, discussed fielding a write-in candidate, pushing Alabama s governor to delay the Dec. 12 special election or even not seating Mr. Moore at all should he be elected. In an interview, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, declined to say whether he would agree to seat Mr. Moore should he win. Mr. McConnell deferred a question about a possible write-in campaign by Senator Luther Strange, the current occupant of the seat, to Mr. Strange.The establishment is losing control so they re taking drastic measures to get it back The scandal facing candidate Roy Moore is the biggest hit job since the fake Russian  Golden Showers  Dossier the DNC and media pushed out to try and destroy Trump. You have to really question Republican leadership when they go to these lengths to harm a candidate. Judge Moore has been in public service for decades but we re just now hearing about the issue with a 14-year old when he was 32? C mon now This smells to high heaven of a smear job.Remember that the swamp creatures in the Republican Party detest Trump because he s not beholden to the Chamber of Commerce s wish for illegal cheap labor.

"ALABAMA ABC AFFILIATE Cant Find One Voter Who Believes Roy Moore WaPo Report [VIDEO]","A Birmingham, Alabama ABC affiliate sought out voters in Columbiana, AL to gauge their reactions to the Washington Post report that alleged Republican U.S. Senate hopeful Roy Moore engaged in inappropriate conduct with four teenage girls more than 34 years ago.None of the respondents according to Walsh told her they believed the Post s reporting. It s hard to believe the events that transpired yesterday,  Gordon Fluker of nearby Wilsonville, AL said to Walsh about the Washington Post report.Moore continues to lead his Democrat opponent by double digits Voters are not buying the accusers story The latest problem with the story is the mother of the accuser s story. She just made a huge mistake in her recounting of what happened over 34 years ago The character assassination of Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore continues with different RINO Republicans coming out to say Moore should step down as a candidate for US Senate. The problem is that the press and the anti-Moore politicians have crucified Moore We thought you were innocent until proven guilty!Another key fact: The claim is a 40 year old claim brought to light by a woman who has ties to the DNC So many things about this claim just don t pass the smell test. Breitbart News has yet another item that doesn t help the accuser s case:MOTHER MAKES BIG MISTAKE: The mother of Leigh Corfman, who says that Alabama Senatorial Candidate Roy Moore tried to engage in a sexual encounter with her when she was 14, has contradicted a key detail of Corfman s story. Speaking by phone to Breitbart News on Saturday, Corfman s mother, Nancy Wells, 71, says that her daughter did not have a phone in her bedroom during the period that Moore is reported to have allegedly called Corfman   purportedly on Confman s bedroom phone   to arrange at least one encounter.Moore strongly denies Corfman s claims.The Washington Post, which first published its newsmaking, on-the-record interview with Corfman last week, cited Corfman as remembering that she provided Moore with her number when she was 14. She said that she spoke to Moore from what she described as the phone in her bedroom.Citing Corfman, the Post reported:After her mother went into the courtroom, Corfman says, Moore asked her where she went to school, what she liked to do and whether he could call her sometime. She remembers giving him her number and says he called not long after. She says she talked to Moore on her phone in her bedroom, and they made plans for him to pick her up at Alcott Road and Riley Street, around the corner from her house.Soon after, Corfman said, he called again, and picked her up again at the same spot.Later on, Corfman described a third phone call:She says that after their last encounter, Moore called again, but that she found an excuse to avoid seeing him. She says that at some point during or soon after her meetings with Moore, she told two friends in vague terms that she was seeing an older man.Corfman clearly claimed she spoke to Moore on what she said was  her phone in her bedroom  on at least one of those occasions. The Post did not specify whether the second or third alleged calls purportedly took place on a bedroom phone.Wells, Corfman s mother, was asked by Breitbart News:  Back then did she have her own phone in her room or something? No,  she replied matter-of-factly.  But the phone in the house could get through to her easily. HOW COULD HE BE GUILTY?The Post story relies heavily on Corfman s memory and her ability to recount events consistently.The newspaper reported that  Corfman described her story consistently in six interviews with The Post. The Post story uses the word  remembers  10 times when quoting or paraphrasing Corfman.Here are those 10 times:1: The Post cited Corfman thusly:  I wanted it over with   I wanted out,  she remembers thinking. This detail related to Corfman s claim that Moore drove her to his house, removed his own clothes besides his underwear, took off her shirt and guided her hand to his underwear.2: During the initial alleged encounter, when Corfman said that Moore was watching her while Corfman s mother went into the courtroom, the Post reported,  She remembers giving him her number and says he called not long after. 3:  I remember the further I got from my house, the more nervous I got,  Corfman was quoted as saying when she recalled the alleged drive with Moore from her house.5   7: The Post used the word three times when citing Corfman in the following paragraph:She remembers an unpaved driveway. She remembers going inside and him giving her alcohol on this visit or the next, and that at some point she told him she was 14. She says they sat and talked. She remembers that Moore told her she was pretty, put his arm around her and kissed her, and that she began to feel nervous and asked him to take her home, which she says he did.8   Referring to the alleged sexual encounter, the Post reported:She remembers that Moore kissed her, that he took off her pants and shirt, and that he touched her through her bra and underpants. She says that he guided her hand to his underwear and that she yanked her hand back.9   In that same encounter, the Post relates:She remembers thinking,  I don t want to do this  and  I need to get out of here.  She says that she got dressed and asked Moore to take her home, and that he did.Meanwhile, Wells told Breitbart that she and her daughter stick by the Post s story.  It s truthful and it was researched very well,  she said.Asked if she could remember Moore, then a 32-year-old assistant district attorney, allegedly asking to watch her daughter in 1971 while Wells went into a courtroom, Wells recounted the story essentially the same way she told it to the Post.Wells told this reporter:  We were sitting in the hall. He came up and started talking to us. We were sitting on a bench waiting to go into court. He said, you know,  What are you doing.  You know, we told him. He is Roy Moore. And he said,  You don t want her to go in there and hear all of the bickering.  And I said,  No.  He said,  I will be glad to stay out here with her and bring her in if she needs to come in.  And so that is the way it started. Probably if it were in today s times that never would have happened,  Wells added.  He sounded like someone that I could trust and we were there in the courthouse. Corfman described her own troubled background to the Post, including three divorces, bankruptcies and a history of drug abuse.The Post related:She says that her teenage life became increasingly reckless with drinking, drugs, boyfriends, and a suicide attempt when she was 16.As the years went on, Corfman says, she did not share her story about Moore partly because of the trouble in her life. She has had three divorces and financial problems. While living in Arizona, she and her second husband started a screen-printing business that fell into debt. They filed for bankruptcy protection three times, once in 1991 with $139,689 in unpaid claims brought by the Internal Revenue Service and other creditors, according to court records.Moore strongly denied Corfman s claims.  These allegations are completely false and are a desperate political attack by the National Democrat Party and the Washington Post on this campaign,  Moore said in immediate response to the Post s story.Moore s campaign said in a statement,  This garbage is the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation. The campaign pointed out that Moore has been married to his wife, Kayla, for nearly 33 years and has four children and five grandchildren. It also noted that Moore has served in public office in the past and that no such allegations were previously made.The statement said:The Judge has been a candidate in four hotly-contested statewide political contests, twice as a gubernatorial candidate and twice as a candidate for chief justice. He has been a three-time candidate for local office, and he has been a national figure in two ground-breaking, judicial fights over religious liberty and traditional marriage. After over 40 years of public service, if any of these allegations were true, they surely would have been made public long before now,  the statement continued.On Saturday, Moore further addressed the allegations: Now I want to address something that some people have come here to hear about,  Moore said at a local campaign event.  Shortly after becoming the Republican nominee for the United States Senate, the Washington Post began an attack on the Foundation for Moral Law, on my wife, and on me. For weeks, we read about my salary which they distorted, about taxes where they said we were paid money we never got. But we endured that. Later, they came out and endorsed my opponent in this race,  he continued.  Just two days ago, the Washington Post published yet another attack on my character and reputation in a desperate attempt to stop my political campaign for the United States Senate. These attacks about a minor are completely false and untrue about something that happened nearly 40 years ago. But more than being completely false and untrue, they are very hurtful to me personally. I wanted to make it clear to the media present and the people present, I have not provided alcoholic beverages beer or anything else to a minor. I have not been guilty of sexual misconduct with anyone,  he declared.  These allegations came only four and a half weeks before the general election on Dec. 12. Why now? For forty years I have been closely scrutinized in the press and the public media. I have had investigations by the attorney general, I ve had investigations by the judicial inquiry commission on more than one occasion, I ve had investigations by the court of the judiciary, I ve been in five statewide campaigns in which they do opposition research they do investigations, as you can see in every one I ve ever run and three county elections and two major controversies over religious liberty and the Ten Commandments and same-sex marriage,  he continued.  I ve been investigated more than any other person in this country. That grown women would wait forty years to come right before an election to bring charges is absolutely unbelievable.

The CNN host was not pleased with the attorney s quip of  Don Easy Peasy Lemon Squeezy Roy Moore attorney calls CNN host 'Don Easy Peasy Lemon Squeezy'   pic.twitter.com/dDyvj81xnO  Josh Caplan (@joshdcaplan) November 12, 2017THE CHARACTER ASSASSINATION OF REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE ROY MOORE CONTINUES  Infowars uncovered a bombshell when they discovered the Facebook page of one of Judge Roy Moore s accusers, Debbie Gibson, who came out in a Washington Post article to accuse him of sexual misconduct that allegedly took place 36 years ago.Debbie Wesson Gibson says that she was 17 in the spring of 1981 when Moore spoke to her Etowah High School civics class about serving as the assistant district attorney. She says that when he asked her out, she asked her mother what she would say if she wanted to date a 34-year-old man. Gibson says her mother asked her who the man was, and when Gibson said  Roy Moore,  her mother said,  I d say you were the luckiest girl in the world. Among locals in Gadsden, a town of about 47,000 back then, Moore  had this godlike, almost deity status   he was a hometown boy made good,  Gibson says,  West Point and so forth. Gibson says that they dated for two to three months, and that he took her to his house, read her poetry and played his guitar. She says he kissed her once in his bedroom and once by the pool at a local country club. Looking back, I m glad nothing bad happened,  says Gibson, who now lives in Florida.  As a mother of daughters, I realize that our age difference at that time made our dating inappropriate. Debbie Gibson hates Donald Trump, but that s not all, she s pretty fond of Judge Roy Moore s opponent, Doug Ross for US Senate In Alabama as well Here are a few anti-Trump posts that were found on Gibson s Facebook page: One of senatorial candidate Roy Moore s accusers is apparently a fervent Democrat who has worked for the DNC as a sign language interpreter for Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, a revelation which the Washington Post never included in its original report.The accuser, Debbie Gibson, had also publically supported Moore s opponent Doug Jones before the accusations came to light.Gibson openly bragged about signing for Hillary during a campaign appearance. On a side note, we re not sure who she s signing for. The crowd behind Hillary, that is usually packed with the Democrats hand-picked  diverse  crowd, appears to be pretty thin.Here s a post from Gibson s page proving that she s supporting Judge Roy Moore s Democrat opponent for US Senate:She even posted a video of Moore s opponent, Doug Jones to promote him to her friends on Facebook. The screenshot below shows the post on her page. Interestingly, when attacking Moore ally Steve Bannon for suggesting the Washington Post was politically motivated in its reporting, the newspaper implied that Gibson wasn t  down with Democratic propaganda,  a statement which seemingly conflicts with Gibson s political activism:That s not what the photos say The Washington Post reported: According to campaign reports, none of the women has donated to or worked for Moore s Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, or his rivals in the Republican primary But notice the precise wording; it s lawyer-speak. It might very well be true that Gibson didn t donate or work for Doug Jones, but according to her Facebook profile, she did actively campaign for him, which doesn t help her credibility and it should have been reported   yet the Washington Post conveniently left it out.",politics,"Nov 12, 2017"

Now the Army has exclusively shared photos of the new face of American chivalry with DailyMail.com.Meet Chief Warrant Officer 2 Bobby Zizelman, a helicopter test pilot who stepped in to warm Sanders up on the tarmac at U.S. Army Garrison Yongsan.Zizelman hails from Roanoke, Virginia and is stationed in Korea on a two-year deployment along with his wife and their two daughters.They came to Yongsan just a month ago from Fort Riley, Kansas.Katelyn Radack, a public affairs officer with the 2nd Combat Aviation Brigade, said Friday that Zizelman has been in the Army for 11 years, beginning as an  11B  infantryman in the 3rd Ranger Regiment and now serving as an aviator   a role he s had since 2011. Lt. Colonel Junel Jeffrey, a spokeswoman for the 2nd Infantry Division, said Zizelman s job is to fly Chinook helicopters on maintenance test missions for the General Support Aviation Battalion, part of the 3rd Battalion, 2nd Aviation Regiment.Zizelman, who was on-hand to certify the safety of the choppers scheduled to ferry Trump and his team to the Korean DMZ, stepped in on Wednesday when he saw the jacketless Sanders shivering in tarmac winds with temperatures in the 40s. One of our brave soldiers was nice enough to loan me his flight jacket,  Sanders told DailyMail.com,  because I was freezing.  The tough-girl Trump spokeswoman put the Army Combat Uniform coat on right over her dress and pearls.Trump s unscheduled attempt to visit the Korean DMZ was foiled by dense fog that forced the helicopter convoy to turn around when they were just 5 minutes from the landing zone.Military pilots couldn t see each other and decided to scrub the mission.Sanders said the president was disappointed, even as he waited gamely for nearly an hour in his limousine for the weather to clear.

However, Oprah s people have responded to his claims, clarifying that they hold absolutely no truth.The site reports that Weinstein told his team and friends on multiple occasions that Oprah called him earlier this week urging him to speak out and  defend himself,  and once he did that, she would come out and support him. While he claimed that several powerful figures in Hollywood have voiced their support of him, he repeatedly highlighted Oprah. WE DON T WANT ANY A HOLES AROUND US Oprah Winfrey doesn t want any sexual harassment problems on the sets of her OWN shows.When asked how she ensures her staff and actors are protected, Winfrey told People,  We don t want any a holes around us. She then went into detail sharing the process by which actors and crew are chosen to pluck out any unwanted folks. First of all, starting with all-female directors,  Winfrey, 63, said.  Ava DuVernay casts from the spirit of the person and looks for skill and talent. You re casting with the very idea of surrounding yourself and when you re looking at casting you re looking at  Does this guy fit with this woman? Does this little boy fit? Could those two people have had that boy? And how do we make this family? Winfrey adds it s a truly a combination of everything.  We re looking at those things and not just looking at who s gonna be the star and take the lead but looking at how does it all integrate so that we can evolve into something bigger,  she added.The media mogul s comments come on the heels of more than 50 women accusing Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault, harassment and rape.

So why aren t the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillary s crimes & Russia relations?

That includes all of the Russia-related investigations, which special counsel Robert Mueller is overseeing.In an interview last week with The New York Times, Trump said he wouldn t have hired Sessions if he knew he d recuse himself from the Russia investigation. So Jeff Sessions takes the job, gets into the job, recuses himself,  Trump said.  I then have   which, frankly, I think is very unfair to the president. How do you take a job and then recuse yourself? If he would have recused himself from the job, I would have said,  Thanks, Jeff, but I can t, you know, I m not going to take you.  It s extremely unfair, and that s a mild word, to the president. So he recuses himself. I then end up with a second man, who s a deputy. When Trump was first selecting his top cabinet officials after winning the November election, Giuliani insisted on being named the secretary of state. He reportedly was not interested in other top posts, including the attorney general. ",politics,"Nov 11, 2017"
"PRESIDENT TRUMP Makes Room Erupt in Laughter with Hilarious Story At State Banquet In Japan [Video]","President Trump spoke at the State Banquet during his visit to Japan. He told a hilarious story about first meeting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe after the election. This was just one example of many from the Asia trip where President Trump succeeded in diplomacy and becoming closer to world leaders he visited.

It also was an opportunity to display some nimble gymnastics, according to Japan s TV Tokyo. The television network flew a helicopter over the Kasumigaseki Country Club on Sunday to capture the highly anticipated informal game.HERE S WHAT HAPPENED:It broadcast a video showing a player identified as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe trying repeatedly to hit his ball out of a steep bunker. As he finally made the shot, Trump began walking away, and Abe ran up the side of the bunker to catch up. But just as the 63-year-old prime minister stepped onto the grass, he slipped, making a backward flip down into the sand. He quickly stood up and picked up his cap.Trump apparently never noticed the flip as he walked away, his back to Abe. An attendant raking the sand also continued his work.Tabloid magazines raised questions over whether the two leaders really talked during the game.

"WATCH: MITT ROMNEY DOESNT Think Roy Moore Deserves Fair Treatment In Questionable 40-Year-Old Sex Assault Allegations&Has Romney Already Forgotten What Harry Reids LIE Did To His Campaign?","Yesterday, former GOP Republican presidential candidate, Mitt Romney, came out with one of his most incredible statements to date. After months of silence, Mitt tweeted about the 36-40-year-old sexual misconduct allegations against Alabama s Republican candidate for Senator, Judge Roy Moore.In his tweet, Mitt told Americans that Judge Roy Moore was not entitled to a fair investigation and that Moore should  step aside . Romney tweeted:  Innocent until proven guilty is for criminal convictions, not elections. I believe Leigh Corfman. Her account is too serious to ignore. Moore is unfit for office and should step aside. Innocent until proven guilty is for criminal convictions, not elections. I believe Leigh Corfman. Her account is too serious to ignore. Moore is unfit for office and should step aside.  Mitt Romney (@MittRomney) November 10, 2017Mitt has remained mostly dormant since he went off on his anti-Trump rant just before the Presidential election.  The last time we saw Mitt, was when he was in Trump Towers, pandering to President-elect Trump for a job in his administration. It appears that, much like John McCain, the anti-conservative, bitter, former GOP presidential candidate just can t keep his disdain for Republicans, who are unafraid to openly fight for their convictions, to himself. Perhaps Mitt s nasty remarks were intended to help ingratiate himself with liberal voters in Utah, as he allegedly is preparing to run for the retiring Republican Senator Orin Hatch s seat. It s also quite possible that after the United States watched Mitt give up the race after he pummeled Barack Obama in their first presidential debate, that Mitt just doesn t  have the stomach for Republicans who actually fight back when they re being attacked by the left.Is it possible that Mitt has already forgotten the lie that Harry Reid pushed out to the voters only months before the election about Mitt not paying taxes for the past 1w years?On July 12, 2012, Senator Harry Reid stood before his comrades on the Senate floor and told a bald-faced lie about then-candidate Mitt Romney not paying his taxes for the past 12 years. Reid knowingly lied to Congress telling them Mitt Romney s father set the precedent for presidential candidates allowing the American public to view their taxes, but Mitt Romney can t do that because he s paid no taxes for 12 years. His father, George Romney, set the precedent that people running for president would file their tax returns, let everybody look at them. But Mitt Romney can t do that because he s basically paid no taxes in the prior 12 years. Watch:Two years later, Harry Reid was later questioned by CNN s Dana Bash about the lie he told to his fellow Senators. His response could not have been more arrogant or disrespectful to the American voters who based their votes for Barack Obama, based on a lie that Senator Harry Reid told only 4 months before the election.So, tell us again Mitt, how it doesn t matter if a political candidate is guilty of charges levied against him by the left, that their only response must be to  step down  if they re accused of wrongdoing.Yesterday, it was revealed that at least one of Judge Roy Moore s accusers was deeply involved in Democrat politics, is virulently anti-Trump, and has been openly pushing for Judge Roy Moore s Democrat opponent Doug Ross on her personal Facebook page.It was also revealed that Stephanie McCrummen, one of the co-writers of the Washington Post article that smeared Moore with 4 unproven allegations has a history of  faking  things to benefit herself (read more HERE). More and more details continue to emerge about Roy Moore s alleged  victims .Stay tuned, for those of us who are sick and tired of watching Republicans get kicked around and watching their careers being ruined, this isn t over yet ",politics,"Nov 11, 2017"
"OOPS! NEW EVIDENCE SHOWS WOMAN Who Accused Roy Moore of Sexual Misconduct Worked For Hillary Campaign&Supported His Democrat Opponent On Facebook","Infowars uncovered a bombshell when they discovered the Facebook page of one of Judge Roy Moore s accusers, Debbie Gibson, who came out in a Washington Post article to accuse him of sexual misconduct that allegedly took place 36 years ago.Debbie Wesson Gibson says that she was 17 in the spring of 1981 when Moore spoke to her Etowah High School civics class about serving as the assistant district attorney. She says that when he asked her out, she asked her mother what she would say if she wanted to date a 34-year-old man. Gibson says her mother asked her who the man was, and when Gibson said  Roy Moore,  her mother said,  I d say you were the luckiest girl in the world. Among locals in Gadsden, a town of about 47,000 back then, Moore  had this godlike, almost deity status   he was a hometown boy made good,  Gibson says,  West Point and so forth. Gibson says that they dated for two to three months, and that he took her to his house, read her poetry and played his guitar. She says he kissed her once in his bedroom and once by the pool at a local country club. Looking back, I m glad nothing bad happened,  says Gibson, who now lives in Florida.  As a mother of daughters, I realize that our age difference at that time made our dating inappropriate. Debbie Gibson hates Donald Trump, but that s not all, she s pretty fond of Judge Roy Moore s opponent, Doug Ross for US Senate In Alabama as well Here are a few anti-Trump posts that were found on Gibson s Facebook page: One of senatorial candidate Roy Moore s accusers is apparently a fervent Democrat who has worked for the DNC as a sign language interpreter for Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, a revelation which the Washington Post never included in its original report.The accuser, Debbie Gibson, had also publically supported Moore s opponent Doug Jones before the accusations came to light.Gibson openly bragged about signing for Hillary during a campaign appearance. On a side note, we re not sure who she s signing for. The crowd behind Hillary, that is usually packed with the Democrats hand-picked  diverse  crowd, appears to be pretty thin.Here s a post from Gibson s page proving that she s supporting Judge Roy Moore s Democrat opponent for US Senate:She even posted a video of Moore s opponent, Doug Jones to promote him to her friends on Facebook. The screenshot below shows the post on her page. Interestingly, when attacking Moore ally Steve Bannon for suggesting the Washington Post was politically motivated in its reporting, the newspaper implied that Gibson wasn t  down with Democratic propaganda,  a statement which seemingly conflicts with Gibson s political activism:That s not what the photos say The Washington Post reported: According to campaign reports, none of the women has donated to or worked for Moore s Democratic opponent, Doug Jones, or his rivals in the Republican primary But notice the precise wording; it s lawyer-speak. It might very well be true that Gibson didn t donate or work for Doug Jones, but according to her Facebook profile, she did actively campaign for him, which doesn t help her credibility and it should have been reported   yet the Washington Post conveniently left it out.",politics,"Nov 10, 2017"
"WOW! LIBERAL Fox News Host Geraldo Rivera SLAMS Hypocrisy of Left For Ignoring Sexual Assault Allegations Against Bill Clinton","Liberal FOX News host, Geraldo Rivera, took to Twitter to express his disgust over the hypocritical left and their selective outrage over sex harassment allegations based on the political party of the accused.Geraldo Rivera asked the left a very good question,  Why are so many who profess to be outraged &amp; repulsed by alleged sexual harassment by @realDonaldTrump unmoved by similar allegations vs. @BillClinton? so offended by alleged conduct in a Moscow hotel room, yet unfazed by admitted conduct in the #OvalOffice ? Why are so many who profess to be outraged & repulsed by alleged sexual harassment by @realDonaldTrump unmoved by similar allegations vs. @BillClinton ?  so offended by alleged conduct in a Moscow hotel room, yet unfazed by admitted conduct in the #OvalOffice ?  Geraldo Rivera (@GeraldoRivera) November 10, 2017While the media shark-tank surrounded Trump, hoping to prove the ALLEGED sexual harassment charges (Not surprisingly, after Trump won the election, all of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct have gone into hiding)  against him  were real, they refused to even consider the confessions of multiple women against Bill Clinton and his enabling wife during the campaign. The real difference, of course, is that the women accusing Bill Clinton of sexual assault, have been screaming from the rooftops for decades about the sexual abuse they endured by the former governor of Arkansas.Rivera brought up another great point in his tweet as it relates to the fake Trump-Russian dossier story that the left has been apoplectic about since the news broke in the liberal media several months ago. It appears, however, that the left has already forgotten the reason Bill Clinton was impeached after lying to a federal grand jury about having sexual encounters with a 19-year old intern in the Oval Office while serving as our nation s President.Meanwhile, it s also curious how many RINO s in Congress, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, have said that without any investigation or opportunity to prove that any of the allegations of sexual misconduct against 3 minors are untrue, that Republican candidate for US Senate, Judge Roy Moore (AL), should step down. Does anyone remember telling Hillary to  step down  because there should never be a geriatric pervert allowed to roam the halls of the White House putting visitors and the staff in potential danger of sexual assault? For that matter, does anyone remember telling Bill Clinton to  step down  when he was accused of sexual assault over and over again while he was running for the office of the President of the United States? The answer is  no , there was no such call for either Clinton to  step down  and give up their political ambitions.This isn t the first time Fox News host Geraldo Rivera, who is a self-described liberal, has spoken out against the hypocrisy of the left. In February 2017, Rivera resigned from a voluntary position at Yale University after the school decided to change the name of a residential college that honors a slavery supporter.Rivera said Sunday on Twitter that he resigned as an associate fellow of Calhoun College. He said the position was an honor  but intolerant insistence on political correctness is lame. ",politics,"Nov 10, 2017"

You can almost hear the leadership of the Chinese government laughing from China to America,  she continued. Maybe you can feel it coming through the ground because if you dig a hole here, you will reach China,  Pelosi said.What Pelosi did not mention is the president also noted, during his same remarks this week, that while he doesn t fault China for doing what is in its best interest, he does fault previous administrations for entering into bad trade deals.

"JUST IN: WaPo Reporter Who Broke News On Judge Roy Moore Story Has A Criminal History Of Faking","Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore is denying that he romantically pursued teenagers as young as 14 while he was in his 30s after a bombshell report. The women accusing Moore told the Washington Post that when they were between the ages of 14 and 18, he romantically pursued them.One woman, Leigh Corfman, told the Post that when she was 14 years old in 1979, a 32-year-old Moore  took off her shirt and pants and removed his clothes. Corfman told the Post that Moore  touched her over her bra and underpants, she says, and guided her hand to touch him over his underwear. The outspoken social conservative said in a statement the four women quoted by the Washington Post are lying. This garbage is the very definition of fake news and intentional defamation,  Moore said.Former White House adviser Stephen Bannon helped Moore trounce establishment favorite Luther Strange in a September Republican primary, over President Trump s warning that Moore was less electable.Moore currently is in a close race against Democrat Doug Jones ahead of a Dec. 12 election.   Washington ExaminerStephanie McCrummen, the reporters who co-wrote the Washington Post hit piece on Judge Roy Moore, apparently has a history of  faking  things like fake checks for instance According to the anti-Trump publication, Red State, McCrummen, who works for the Washington Post, (who many consider to be  fake news, after using mulitple  unnamed sources  in an attempt to tie President Trump to the Russians), has a criminal record that involves writing a FAKE check.Ms. McCrummen has a rather interesting criminal history herself, as public criminal records in multiple states stretching across 4 time zones have shown.Ms. McCrummen s criminal history began with North Carolina Case # 1992 CR 00654, a violation of the Article 19   False Pretenses and Cheats section of the North Carolina Criminal Code. Ms. McCrummen was convicted of a crime punishable by up to six months of imprisonment for writing a hot check that was deemed worthless.Ms. McCrummen s other offenses are all traffic related and in 2010, she was tracked down by the courts after she had escaped Arizona s jurisdiction to D.C., and her case was assigned to the Fines/Fees and Restitution Enforcement (FARE) Program established to collect delinquent court ordered restitution, fines, fees, and surcharges . After the FARE team tracked her down at her Washington D.C. apartment, they finally appeared to get her attention and on October 23, 2010 she paid the defaulted fine to the criminal court, almost two months after her conviction.

C.K. went on to say that he didn t really regret it, he just regretted  saying it , or in other words, he regrets that he was outed as a whiny, liberal, crybaby who can t control his emotions (our translation). One of the most interesting lines in the interview came after the Trump bashing where the outed sexual predator tells Colbert,  I wouldn t take it back. If you went back and fixed all the mistakes you made, you erase yourself. You know, there s just no point to that.  Good luck trying to  erase yourself  after you ve been outed creep Here s part of Louis C.K. s email to his fans: Please stop it with voting for Trump. It was funny for a little while.

I just think the government should reflect the people. And we are about 40 percent conservative and 40 percent liberal. When I was growing up and when I was a younger man, liberals and conservatives were friends with differences. They weren t enemies.

The two sources said Schiller s comments came in the context of him adamantly disputing the allegations made in the Trump dossier, written by a former British intelligence operative, which describes Trump having an encounter with prostitutes at the hotel during the pageant. Schiller described his reaction to that story as being,  Oh my God, that s bull -,  two sources said.The conversation with the Russian about the five women took place after a morning meeting about the pageant in Moscow broke up, two sources said.That night, two sources said, Schiller said he discussed the conversation with Trump as Trump was walking back to his hotel room, and Schiller said the two men laughed about it as Trump went to bed alone. Schiller testified that he stood outside Trump s hotel room for a time and then went to bed.One source noted that Schiller testified he eventually left Trump s hotel room door and could not say for sure what happened during the remainder of the night.Two other sources said Schiller testified he was confident nothing happened.Schiller said he and Trump were aware of the risk that hotel rooms in Moscow could be set up to capture hidden video, two sources said.Schiller was grilled about the Moscow trip as part of four hours of testimony before the House Intelligence Committee. The questioning around the Moscow trip took a significant amount of time, the sources said. Schiller was also asked about the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between Donald Trump Jr. and Russians, two of the sources said. He testified that he did not recall much about that day. A White House lawyer familiar with the matter said that the White House  and fair-minded people are pleased that Mr. Schiller was able to debunk yet another of the false claims in the fantasy dossier funded by the DNC and the Clinton campaign and prepared during a time its foreign author worked closely with paid Russian operatives. A Navy veteran, Schiller worked part-time as a bodyguard for Trump while still an NYPD officer. He began working for Trump full-time after his retirement from the force in 2002 and became his director of security in 2004.

"MICHIGAN Senate Approves Bill To Allow Concealed Carry In Gun Free Zones Or Mass Murderer Empowerment Zones","Should legal gun owners be allowed to freely carry anywhere in their state, including dorm rooms and school campuses?In the wake of mass shootings in Las Vegas and Texas that left dozens of people dead or injured, a Michigan Senate committee approved bills Tuesday that will allow gun owners to carry concealed weapons in gun-free zones such as schools, churches, day care centers, bars, dorms, and stadiums.The shooting at a Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Sunday, which left 26 people dead and 20 more injured, makes state Senate Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof, a Republican from West Olive, Mich., more certain that now is the time to take up the gun legislation. Some have said it s insensitive to bring up these issues now, but I feel quite the opposite,  he told a standing-room-only crowd in the Senate Government Operations Committee.  The recent events will allow us to look at how we can deter those who want to do harm. And responsible, well-trained, licensed concealed-pistol holders can be one of those deterrents. The bills taken up in the Senate Government Operations Committee passed on a party-line vote with Republicans supporting the three-bill package and Democrats opposing it. The bills also would close the open-carry loophole, effectively barring gun owners from openly carrying their weapons in gun-free zones.He gained support from gun rights groups, including the National Rifle Association and the Michigan Coalition for Responsible Gun Owners. The idea of having the ability to arm a well-qualified, well-trained individual is tantamount to setting out a scenario where we no longer set up a sheep for the wolf,  said Robert Rudowski of the gun owners group.Gun-free zones should be called  mass murderer empowerment zones,  said Steve Dulan, spokesman for the gun owners group.Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, vetoed similar legislation in 2012, just four days after a horrific shooting in Newtown, Conn., when a heavily armed man muscled his way into Sandy Hook Elementary School and killed 20 first-graders and six adults.Snyder said that bill had a fatal loophole that didn t allow for those institutions to opt out of the new legislation and prohibit weapons from their buildings. His spokeswoman, Anna Heaton, said Tuesday that Snyder hasn t seen the latest version of the concealed- carry bills and hadn t taken a position on them.Meekhof said he has talked with Snyder about the new legislation and that he s  not necessarily  on board with it.  USA Today Never-Trumper  Governor Rick Snyder (R), who some Republicans believe leans to the left on more than one important issue, like vetoing legislation that would require MI voters to have a valid ID in order to vote, is currently facing some serious allegations related to the Flint water crisis.WXYZ   Harvey Hollins, the man Gov. Snyder appointed to handle the Flint Water Crisis, recently testified that he told the governor about increasing lead in Flint water months before Snyder told Congress he learned about it.The testimony came during the preliminary hearing for Michigan Health and Human Services Director Nick Lyons, who is facing involuntary manslaughter and misconduct in office charges for his alleged role in the water crisis.Hollins testified that he told Snyder in July 2015 and August 2015 that there were concerns about increased lead levels in Flint s water.During congressional testimony in March 2016, Snyder testified that he didn t even learn about the dangerous levels of lead in Flint s water system until October 2015. I told the governor that we re hearing a lot more folks complaining about lead, copper, and TTHM (total trihalomethanes),  Hollins testified.We d love to hear what you think about legal gun owners being able to carry anywhere in their state?

Prepare for liberal heads to explode in 5 4 3 2 1According to a POLITICO/Morning Consult poll conducted on the eve of the first anniversary of Trump s historic election, 82 percent of those who say they supported Trump last year would vote for him again if they had to do it over. That s slightly more than those who say they would vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton again   78 percent   if they had the chance.Only 7 percent of Trump voters and 8 percent of Clinton voters say they would vote for a different candidate if they could complete their 2016 ballot again.Trump s supporters have largely rallied around the president, despite his poor overall approval ratings, the chaos of his first year in office and the ongoing investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.But there are worrying signs for Trump that voters are less inclined to give him a second term three years from now if he decides to run for reelection.Those red flags go beyond the natural, downward trajectory of most new presidents. Like Trump, Barack Obama and George W. Bush saw their parties lose governorships in both New Jersey and Virginia the year after their first elections as president. But both Obama and Bush had job-approval ratings over 50 percent at this point.While most Trump voters would back him in a 2016 do-over, some defect when asked whether they will vote for Trump or a generic, unnamed Democrat in 2020. About three-quarters of Trump voters, 76 percent, back Trump in the 2020 matchup, while 8 percent would support the Democrat.  Politico",politics,"Nov 9, 2017"

She asked Clinton to use some of the millions of dollars the campaign had in order to set up a reward fund to find his murderer. But Hillary said she  really had to go. I knew the campaign had over $3 million set aside in a legal fund. Could she help me get this lawsuit started? And don t forget the murder of Seth Rich, I told her.

The stock market is setting records, creating nearly $5 trillion in wealth for the pension, retirement and savings of the American people.

ISIS is on the run, and its caliphate is crumbling. This president reaffirmed the credibility of American power when he enforced a red line against chemical weapons in Syria. He put Iran on notice and made it clear that we cannot certify the Iran nuclear deal. And our administration has brought unprecedented economic and diplomatic pressure to bear on North Korea.It has been a year of accomplishments, and we re just getting started.

The latest example of fraud in this program comes out of the Somali Muslim state of Minnesota Yes, Minnesota is  overrun with Somali Muslims Four of those Muslims are going back to Somalia because of their fraud:Ahmed Mohamed Warsame aka Jama Solob Kayre, 54, a native of Somalia, using the fictitious identity of Jama Solob Kayre, applied for and received a beneficiary diversity visa as the fictitious spouse of Fosia Abdi Adan, the principal diversity visa immigrant of the fictitious family. Warsame unlawfully obtained his visa as the spouse of a diversity visa immigrant from the U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, Yemen, under the DV Program on Jan. 10, 2001. Warsame arrived and was admitted to the United States on May 30, 2001, on his diversity immigrant visa as a permanent resident.Throughout the diversity visa application process, Warsame fraudulently claimed that he was married to Adan and that he and Adan had three children together. Such children included Mohamed Jama Solob, the fictitious identity used by Mustaf Abdi Adan, and Mobarak Jama Solob, the fictitious identity used by Faysal Jama Mire. Adan and Warsame, who used the fictitious identity of Jama Solob Kayre, obtained a divorce in Minnesota for their fictitious marriage after Warsame was admitted as a permanent resident. Warsame continued to fraudulently represent his previous fictitious marriage and fraudulently represent his fictitious parentage of Mohamed Jama Solob and Mobarak Jama Solob, throughout the naturalization process. Warsame, using the fictitious name of Jama Solob Kayre, naturalized on Sept. 13, 2006. During his naturalization, he changed his name to Ahmed Mohamed Warsame.

"DREXEL PROFESSOR BLAMES Whiteness and Entitlement For Texas Church Shooting [Video]","The Drexel University professor who tweeted  all I want for Christmas is white genocide  recently blamed  whiteness  for the Texas massacre that killed 26 people. The outward hate for  whiteness  coming from this so-called professor is disturbing. It s no secret that he detests anyone white and wants to especially demonize white men. Disgusting!George Ciccariello-Maher, who is currently in exile from Drexel s campus and is only teaching online classes, argued in a Democracy Now! interview Monday that  whiteness  and white  entitlement  is the motivating factor behind mass-shootings.Although he noted that mental illness is a factor, Ciccariello-Maher argued that  we can t lose sight of these broader questions,  asking  what is happening with regard to not only white people, but white men, in particular? Ciccariello-Maher argued that there is an  institutional apparatus  that trains white men  in violence and that encourages them to feel as though they re on the losing side of history,  adding that many white males feel like  victims  of society.When white men feel like victims, he contended, they lash out. You know, Trump makes hay out of the fact that white men, in particular, feel as though they re the victims of this society, despite being in absolute control of it,  he said at the end of a lengthy statement regarding the Texas church shooting.  And this is something that is powerfully dangerous, and it s why we re not seeing only the rise in violent attacks, more generally, and the rise of far-right movements, but we re certainly seeing, you know, clearly, sort of some very serious incidents of mass violence, as well. TRANSCRIPT FROM INTERVIEW:AMY GOODMAN: But I wanted to bring George Ciccariello-Maher into this conversation, of Drexel University. You have been you wrote immediately after the Las Vegas massacre, where the 64-year-old white man named Paddock had opened fire on concertgoers below, killing 59 of them. After you wrote, you were banned from the Drexel campus, after questioning why mass shootings in the United States are almost always carried out by white men? Is that right?GEORGE CICCARIELLO MAHER: Yes. And to be clear, when I began to write about what had happened in Las Vegas, I was really writing about this broad question, right? And I think this is a question that we all need to grapple with: When you see these cases of sort of mass this shocking mass brutality, what is it that makes white men so prone to this kind of behavior? And what might be going on today in our country, in which people are stoking a sort of victim complex among white men? You know, what might be happening today to encourage this kind of behavior and to radicalize these kind of actions?And I was immediately subject to a torrent of sort of abuse and threats from, you know, right-wing media outlets. And, you know, we re talking about Breitbart, The Daily Caller and these kind of websites. And it was on the basis of those, and the purported threats that they represented, that I was excluded from campus. My classes were initially canceled, despite the fact that in my classes we had had conversations about this, despite the fact that my students are very knowledgeable and intuitively grasp what is going on in the world around them, and were open to having conversations about these difficult things.AMY GOODMAN: So, your response to what happened on Sunday?GEORGE CICCARIELLO MAHER: I mean, I think we re seeing these kinds of atrocities occurring, and we need to be really asking not only  What can we do?  I think these are important questions what kind of immediate institutional reforms, whether it s targeted you know, targeted gun control for domestic violence might be effective, but we also can t lose sight of these broader questions, and ask,  What is going on in our society today? What is happening with regard to not only white people, but white men, in particular? What is going on with regard to race and gender as they function together? And in this case, in particular, again, we don t know all the facts. We don t know all the details. But we re talking about institutions, that also serve as breeding grounds for violent behavior. We re talking about not only sexual assault in the military, but domestic abuse of those surrounding it and those outside of it. And we re talking about other institutions, as well, that you could bring into the picture, institutions like policing, in which domestic violence is absolutely rife and in which it s very difficult to keep weapons out of the hands of those domestic abusers.And so, we need to think very deeply, I think, about the structural role of what s going in the society. Trump is abroad selling weapons. And we ve got someone who, in this case, apparently, was trained, you know, trained to engage in violence abroad. And yet we act surprised when these people have breaks, when they fall into some kind of crisis, when they find maybe feelings of entitlement frustrated, that they then resort to violence, when we re talking about a structure and institutional apparatus that trains people in violence and that encourages them to feel as though they re on the losing side of history. You know, Trump makes hay out of the fact that white men, in particular, feel as though they re the victims of this society, despite being in absolute control of it. And this is something that is powerfully dangerous, and it s why we re not seeing only the rise in violent attacks, more generally, and the rise of far-right movements, but we re certainly seeing, you know, clearly, sort of some very serious incidents of mass violence, as well.AMY GOODMAN: You know, what s interesting, yesterday, for hour after hour, after this horror on television you know, it came out that there was this mass killing in Texas, and they said the worst church massacre in U.S. history, and they said the worst Texas massacre no one was saying anything about the killer, hour after hour. But clearly, people had seen him, right? Some had survived, people outside, the police. He was dead, whether it was self-inflicted or someone shot him. They clearly knew. And they were talking about, one, the tragedy and, two, not saying anything. And it only led us to believe it must be a white man who did this, because we would have known, I think, right away if the person was a person of color or, certainly, Muslim. We know that often before when it s a case where someone is a Muslim or person of color, that s what they say immediately. Now it was just left hanging, and so you knew that this would be the case.GEORGE CICCARIELLO MAHER: That s absolutely the case, I think. You know, whiteness is never seen as a cause, in and of itself, of these kinds of massacres, of other forms of violence, despite the fact that whiteness is a structure of privilege and it s a structure of power, and a structure that, when it feels threatened, you know, lashes out. And so, that s the kind of thing that we really need to think about, not only why is it and I think there s a lot of attention to the fact that we demonize often Muslims or, you know, other people of color when these attacks occur. The far right, of course, jumps on any violence by people of color and yet, you know, doesn t want to talk about the real deep structures of white supremacy in our society, and again, not just the fringe, not just the Nazi movements, but what people are going through every day and what it is that is driving people to these kinds of situations, where they feel so entitled to dominance that when that s questioned, they can explode in these very, very unpredictable ways AMY GOODMAN: And then GEORGE CICCARIELLO MAHER:  and on targets that, you know, are not you know, it s not a question of white supremacy playing a role simply because someone is targeting people of color. We re talking about people who are having, you know, mental clear mental issues. But again, the cause needs to be identified outside and beyond that, and we need to think much, much harder about what s going on in our society that makes it so sick.AMY GOODMAN: And very clearly, to clarify, so what is your status now at Drexel? And explain how other people have been treated in other situations. You cannot go on campus?GEORGE CICCARIELLO MAHER: Yes, that s that is the status at this point. I m currently teaching classes online. My students are protesting and mobilizing to have me returned to campus, because there s no reason, certainly, to exclude faculty from campus for having important public conversations and for teaching about hard questions. That s what we re there to do.But what you re seeing is a broad wave of aggression against faculty. You ve seen dozens of cases, whether it s, you know, Tommy Curry at Texas A&M, Keeanga-Yamahtta Taylor at Princeton, Johnny Eric Williams at Trinity College. You re seeing far-right websites creating, stoking outrage, attacking faculty members who dare to speak about white supremacy and racism. That s really the common thread of all these cases, is these are anti-racist faculty members, usually people of color, who are targeted, who are attacked, who are threatened, and really having their lives threatened, over being willing to talk about what s going on in the country today.AMY GOODMAN: Well, George Ciccariello-Maher, we want to thank you for being with us, political science professor at Drexel.

"IS CROOKED HILLARY Getting Ready To Compete With Creepy Joe Biden In 2020&As Both Career Politicians Fight For Credit Over Dem Seats Won In BLUE STATES Last Night","The Republican Party should be so fortunate, as to have three aging, white, career politicians like Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders running against each other while representing the future of the  diverse  Democrat Party LOL!Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden gave themselves a pat on the back for the gains made by Democrats in yesterday s off-year election. For Clinton it was that her political group, Onward Together, supported a number of new progressive grass roots groups that did a lot of work on the ground.  Last night was a great reminder of what s possible when we come together and fight for what we believe in,  Clinton tweeted Wednesday morning.  So I wanted to take a few minutes to celebrate the extraordinary successes of a few groups I   and Onward Together   proudly fight alongside. For Biden, who is keeping the door open to a 2020 presidential bid, it was his candidate picks.In a note, to supporters, Biden said Americans voted for a  different kind of leadership.   And last night, nearly every single candidate that I endorsed at your recommendation was elected,  he wrote.  Daily MailWhy were Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden both taking credit for wins in VA, a blue state that went for Hillary in 2016 and, in spite of constantly being referred to in the media as a  swing state , hasn t been a  red state  since 2004 (see chart below):New Jersey is and has been a blue state for decades, so all of the self-congratulations and patting themselves on their own backs seems rather odd unless of course, Hillary and Joe are setting themselves up for what would be the most entertaining ever Democrat presidential primary in 2020. Anyone who believes that Hillary isn t up for another fight doesn t know Hillary. Fingers crossed Hillary s great at taking credit for a win, but prefers to blame everyone but herself when she loses bigly : Hillary Clinton has blamed Russian hackers for her loss   along with many others.

"BRAZILES BOMBSHELL BOOK Exposes How The Media And Democrat Party Hid Hillarys Serious Illness","Silly, silly Donna Brazile. She s publishing a book detailing turmoil in the Democratic Party during the 2016 campaign, highlighted by her concern that Hillary Clinton was seriously ill and might need to be replaced by Joe Biden or Bernie Sanders.Was the Democrat Party setting up Joe Biden to replace Hillary when she accompanied him to his hometown in Scranton, PA? The media completely ignored Hillary s inability to walk or stand unassisted in front of, and inside Joe s childhood home, that was all caught on this incredible, but mostly hidden video. In the video below, Hillary can be seen using the arm of the homeowner for support while reaching for the railing next to the stairs to stabilize herself. She can be seen repeatedly grasping for the railing outside, and then later on, when Hillary s inside the home, she seems unable to stand on her own, as she grasps for the backs of chairs and the kitchen table.Watch:Earlier in the day, Vice President Joe Biden was forced to help the seriously ill Democrat presidential candidate Hillary Clinton down from the podium where she spoke at a small rally.What s the big deal? There s no news here because all this was well-known and covered at the time by the big national newspapers and networks, right?Wrong. If Brazile were rehashing things we knew, there would be no book and no bombshell headlines now.Instead, she has thrown open a new and very big window on 2016   and exposed yet again the consequences of the political biases of the Democratic media.The missed stories are not merely the result of mistakes or sloppy reporting. Brazile s book is a revelation in that it shows that many left-leaning journalists didn t so much cover Clinton as cover up for her.Put it this way: How is it possible that the leader of the Democratic Party was talking to colleagues about trying to replace its nominee during the general election because of health concerns, and none of the thousands of journalists covering the campaign got wind of it?It s not possible   if the media had been playing it down the middle and holding both candidates to the same standard of scrutiny. But big media missed a big story because so much campaign  news  coverage was tilted toward defeating Donald Trump and electing Clinton.Anything that could possibly suggest Trump was unfit for the Oval Office   bingo, front page, top of the broadcast.On the other hand, anything that could hurt Clinton was downplayed or ignored. Nothing to see here, move along.The coverage of Clinton s health was a prime example of the tilt. Her coughing fits, especially a long one on Labor Day, and a history of falling were pointed out by the popular Drudge Report, some Republicans and smaller, conservative-leaning sites to suggest she was not being honest about her health.But her campaign always denied anything was wrong   allergies, the candidate, and her flacks insisted, caused the persistent coughs, and major news organizations mostly nodded their heads and stayed mum, accepting the official denials without skepticism.The dam cracked a bit on Labor Day, when an NBC reporter filed a 91-word, four-paragraph story that said Clinton had been unable to finish her speech in Ohio because of a coughing fit.The truth was dangerous, so the Praetorian Guard sprang to Clinton s defense. The NBC reporter, Andrew Rafferty, was mocked and insulted, first by the campaign, and then by journalists, including some MSNBC commentators who turned on their colleague as if he had violated a secret oath.CNN joined the Clinton amen chorus, and at the Washington Post, political writer Chris Cillizza denounced the topic of Clinton s health as  a totally ridiculous issue  and declared it a  sure-fire loser  for Trump. It s hard to plausibly insist, based on the available data, that Clinton is ill,  insisted Cillizza, who is now at CNN.Five days later, Clinton was unable to walk on her own and collapsed at the 9/11 ceremony in Manhattan as she tried to get into a van. The campaign insisted she was just  dehydrated  until a short video of the incident aired, then admitted the candidate had been diagnosed with pneumonia days earlier.In other words, the claim of allergies was a big fat lie. That prompted Brazile to contemplate starting the process of replacing Clinton, writing in her book that the campaign also was  anemic  and had  the odor of failure.  She says she considered numerous tickets to replace Clinton and Sen. Tim Kane, and decided that Biden and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) would be the best.It s not clear how long she deliberated or how many people she talked to, but Brazile writes that Biden called her on Sept. 12. In the end, she says, she made no move because she couldn t disappoint Clinton s supporters.For entire story: NYP",politics,"Nov 8, 2017"
"THEY KNEW! Donna Brazile Blows DNC Secret Wide Open: Exposes Sickening Reason DNC Remained Silent After Russians Hacked Their Emails","Is there a more corrupt and power hungry group of people anywhere in the United States? Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and the entire DNC are the reason for Donald Trump s meteoric rise to the White House after never running for a political office in his lifetime. When the Democrats complain about Donald Trump, they only need to find a mirror, to help them understand why he is so wildly popular with Americans who are sick and tired of the Washington cesspool Donna Brazile says in her new book the Democratic National Committee (DNC) went against professional advice and sat idly for a month while Russians stole data because primaries were still underway in a number of states.In May, when CrowdStrike recommended that we take down our system and rebuild it, the DNC told them to wait a month, because the state primaries for the presidential election were still underway, and the party and the staff needed to be at their computers to manage these efforts,  Brazile wrote in her new book,  Hacks. For a whole month, CrowdStrike watched Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear operating. Cozy Bear was the hacking force that had been in the DNC system for nearly a year. Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear are cybersecurity firms that have reported ties with Russian hackers. Both groups are blamed for the hacks on the DNC in 2016. CrowdStrike is a private U.S. cybersecurity firm that oversaw the protection of the DNC s servers.The DNC was under the leadership of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida in May 2016 the time Brazile is describing in the passage. Shultz resigned in July, notably, over a series of leaked emails that showed DNC officials colluding to undermine Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont s campaign.Brazile s comments, if true, show that the DNC s privately contracted cybersecurity firm advised the Wasserman Schultz -led committee to break down and rebuild its cyber operation to protect against alleged threats. The DNC chose to go against the advice in order to see the Democratic primaries play out, which ended with Clinton becoming the Democrats  nominee.For entire story: Daily Caller",politics,"Nov 8, 2017"

Dobbs names several in the Obama administration who could have been involved in the set-up FUSION GPS LIED ABOUT KNOWING ABOUT MEETING:Fusion GPS responded in a statement:  Fusion GPS learned about this meeting from news reports and had no prior knowledge of it. Any claim that Fusion GPS arranged or facilitated this meeting in any way is false. BUSTED! MEETING BETWEEN FUSION GPS AND RUSSIAN LAWYER BEFORE AND AFTER:The co-founder of Fusion GPS, the firm behind the unverified Trump dossier, met with a Russian lawyer before and after a key meeting she had last year with Trump Jr. The contacts shed new light on how closely tied the firm was to Russian interests, at a time when it was financing research to discredit then-candidate Donald Trump.The opposition research firm has faced renewed scrutiny after litigation revealed that the DNC and Hillary Clinton s campaign paid for that research. Congressional Republicans have since questioned whether that politically financed research contributed to the FBI s investigation of Russian collusion with the Trump campaign   making Fusion s 2016 contacts with Russian interests all the more relevant.DNC MONEY FUNNELED THROUGH LAW FIRM TO FUSION GPS?The June 2016 Trump Tower meeting involving Donald Trump Jr. and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya occurred during a critical period. Bank records show Fusion GPS was paid by a law firm for work on behalf of a Kremlin-linked oligarch while paying a former British spy Christopher Steele to dig up dirt on Trump through his Russian contacts.But hours before the Trump Tower meeting on June 9, 2016, Fusion co-founder and ex-Wall Street Journal reporter Glenn Simpson was with Veselnitskaya in a Manhattan federal courtroom.

While President Trump tried to help Gillespie by using his enormous influence on social media, the truth is, Ed Gillespie didn t want Trump to campaign with him in a state that has been a blue state since 2004.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 8, 2017On Oct 7, 2017, the Washington Examiner reported that Virginia s Republican nominee for governor Ed Gillespie was keeping President Trump at arm s length, suggesting that he viewed him as a liability in his campaign against Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam.Trump, in an unexpected Thursday evening tweet, urged Virginians to vote for Gillespie on Nov. 7, while charging that Northam was soft on gang violence. Gillespie welcomed the president s get-tough-on-crime message, but didn t have much to say about Trump himself.That didn t go unnoticed by one big Trump supporter, John Fredericks, a talk radio host in Southern Virginia who asked Gillespie during a Friday conference call with reporters whether he wanted the president to campaign for him down the stretch.Fredericks told the Washington Examiner in a subsequent interview that Gillespie s hesitance to embrace Trump could cost him on Election Day. Ed failed to capitalize on a golden opportunity to amplify the president s enthusiastic endorsement of him,  said Fredericks, who served as the vice chairman of the Trump campaign in 2016. I was flabbergasted that the Gillespie campaign chose to downplay the president s tweet,  he added.  This is a game changer. If Ed can motivate Trump voters to show up on Nov. 7, he ll win this election. A simple re-tweet and thank you would have gone a long way in solidifying Trump voters  support for Gillespie.

It also appears that the Democratic candidate, Ralph Northam, coordinated with LVF to push that ad; LVF listed the ad as a $60,000+ in-kind media contribution. There s nothing wrong with that, but Northam said this ad was totally outside his campaign operation. Not true.Speaking with Meet the Press s Chuck Todd, Perez said that there s been a lot of dog whistling in this race and that Northam was trying to unite people. Right so, you do that by apparently coordinating with the LVF to push an ad that says white people are all racists, drive pickup trucks, love the Confederacy, and just cannot wait to run over nonwhites in the street? The Roanoke Times, which isn t a Republican-friendly paper, aptly noted that what this ad conveys is that Republicans are bad people, and if you support them you re a bad person.

"NEW FINDINGS SHOW TWO IMPORTANT Words Were Deleted From Cowardly Comeys Remarks About Hillary That Couldve Ended Her Presidential Bid","The word  crooked  doesn t only apply to Hillary. Sadly, America is finding out that there are very few people in positions of power who we can trust. Perhaps the reason President Trump has so many loyal supporters is that Americans believe he s the only person in Washington with the courage and ability to actually drain the cesspool of corrupt government agencies in Washington DC Early drafts of former FBI Director James Comey s remarks about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s use of a private email server acknowledged that there was evidence she had violated a federal statute prohibiting  gross negligence,  but that phrase was deleted, according to Sen. Chuck Grassley.Grassley, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, has been investigating the formulation of Comey s controversial July 2016 remarks in which he announced that the FBI would not seek criminal charges following its probe into Clinton s use of a private email server.The Iowa Republican on Monday said the FBI had recently turned over records relating to then-Director Comey s statement. The FBI included in those documents what Grassley said appears to be a May 2, 2016 draft of Comey s exoneration statement.The draft was written two months before Comey s July 5, 2016 press conference in which he said that he did not believe Clinton had broken any laws even though she had been  extremely careless  in her handling of sensitive, highly classified material.In the draft in question, Grassley said the Comey statement included the following sentence:  There is evidence to support a conclusion that Secretary Clinton, and others, used the private email server in a manner that was grossly negligent with respect to the handling of classified material. The same draft included the following sentence:  Similarly, the sheer volume of information that was properly classified as Secret at the time it was discussed on email (that is, excluding the  up classified  emails) support an inference that the participants were grossly negligent in their handling of that information. Despite this reference to  gross negligence,  Grassley said the same draft statement goes on to determine she should not be prosecuted for a crime.Grassley asked for more details about the documents, including copies of the drafts in their original format and all records relating to discussions about why the edits were made, in a letter sent to FBI Director Christopher Wray Monday. As you are aware, 18 U.S.C. 793(f) makes the mishandling of classified material through gross negligence a criminal act,  Grassley wrote.  Although Director Comey s original version of his statement acknowledged that Secretary Clinton had violated the statute prohibiting gross negligence in the handling of classified information, he nonetheless exonerated her in that early May 2nd draft statement anyway, arguing that this part of the statute should not be enforced. Grassley said later edits,  on or around about June 10  remove those two sentences and include the following sentence instead:  Although we did not find clear evidence that Secretary Clinton or her colleagues intended to violate laws governing the handling of classified information, there is evidence they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information. Comey had the opportunity to charge a woman, who has been accused of breaking the law numerous times, with a crime, and in doing so, would have proved to all of America that nobody, even if their last name is  Clinton , is above the law. Once again, however, Crooked Hillary managed to wriggle off the hook of justice Grassley and Sen. Lindsey Graham, (R., S.C.) said in late August that Comey began drafting a statement rejecting the idea of charging Clinton with a crime over the email issue two months before Clinton was interviewed in the FBI probe. The senators released partial transcripts of interviews the Judiciary Committee conducted with U.S. officials to back up the statement.For entire story: WFB ",politics,"Nov 7, 2017"

Over the weekend, the 56-year-old actor, liberal activist, and Harvey Weinstein bestie, George Clooney, told The Sunday Times Hollywood isn t a priority for him anymore. Look, I acted for a long time and, you know, I m 56,  explained Clooney.  I m not the guy that gets the girl anymore. I shouldn t be the guy that gets the girl. However, there s a more obvious reason why the father of 5-month-old twins has chosen to take a step back from acting. [But], look, if somebody s got Paul Newman in  The Verdict,  I d jump,  he said.  But there aren t that many like that. Acting used to be how I paid the rent, but I sold a tequila company for a billion f g dollars. I don t need money. Back in June, Clooney confirmed that he and his business partners   nightlife businessman Rande Gerber and real estate mogul Mike Meldeman   sold their tequila company Casamigos for $1 billion.  Fox NewsBut are the Clooney twins and George s enormous net worth really the reason he s  taking a break  from acting or could it have more to do with the fact that middle-America has lost their appetite for actors who fund and use their positions to propagandize for leftist causes and politicians?George Clooney s  Suburbicon  that debuted over the Halloween weekend, notched one of the most dismal wide-release debuts in recent years.Despite debuting on more than 2,000 screens,  Suburbicon  managed just $2.8 million, making it one of Paramount Pictures  worst performing wide-releases ever and marking a new box-office low for Clooney as a director and star Matt Damon.Perhaps one of  Clooney s biggest problems is that Americans aren t willing to support the leftist actor, after that little prediction he made about Donald Trump s chances of winning the presidential election in 2016:The arrogant Clooney, who according to Page Six was accused by Vanessa Marquez, a former  ER  actress, who claims she was sexually and racially harassed daily on set   and George Clooney helped  blacklist  her from Hollywood when she complained.George Clooney is also going to have some trouble shaking his association with accused rapist and serial sexual assaulter Harvey Weinstein, who was at one time, a close personal friend of the actor.  say if he s going to stay out of the limelight completely. He was quick to tell The Sunday Times that the current political climate has inspired him to possibly pursue politics. However, the Hollywood star stressed he s not ready to tackle that role.The Sunday Times   Clooney won t say if he s going to stay out of the limelight completely.

So many people since Trump was elected have really been pushing on me to get more involved in actual politics, specifically at the highest office,  he explained.  I don t have political aspirations. He added,  I have always been involved in politics. My father ran for Congress. It s been in our family forever. But, mostly, I can help in ways I actually know very well, like messaging [voters]. Our advice to Clooney would be to stick to the fake world of Hollywood because real Americans don t even want to see your movies, let alone see you making laws on our behalf ",politics,"Nov 7, 2017"

The most shocking information comes at the 4:20 mark when Wheeler says that a  high ranking official at the DNC  wanted to know why he was snooping around.Rod Wheeler:  Here s one other thing that is going to be startling I m just gonna say this right now. I reached out to the police department way back in March when the family first hired me right..to get involved. I didn t hear anything from the police department for 2-3 days.Guess what I learned yesterday from the family of Seth Rich? The police department did not call me back because someone, a high ranking official at the DNC check this out a high ranking official at the DNC when I called the police department, they got that information and called the Rich family wanting to know, why was I snooping around? Shorty after WND wrote a story that outed Donna Brazile as the  high ranking DNC representative who allegedly called the police to ask why a private investigator was  snooping  into Rich s death, Twitter SUSPENDED WND s account!Here s the title and an excerpt from the WND article:BOMBSHELL: DONNA BRAZILE WARNED OFF PRIVATE EYE ON SETH RICH MURDEREx-DNC chairwoman reportedly asked cops why investigator is  snooping  into mysterious case Alicia Powe and Liz Crokin wrote the story that was also posted to and deleted from the social media platform by Twitter: Former Democratic National Committee interim chairwoman Donna Brazile is the high-ranking DNC representative who allegedly called police and the family of murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich and demanded to know why a private investigator was  snooping  into Rich s death, the private eye revealed to WND Monday. The high-ranking DNC official that called the police after I inquired about Rich s case was Donna Brazile,  veteran homicide detective Rod Wheeler told WND.  Why shouldn t I reveal who it was? Brazile, who was also a CNN contributor and a Hillary for America donor at the time, was caught providing Democratic Party nominee Hillary Clinton with questions that would later be asked of Clinton at a televised CNN town hall. In an interview with Fox News before the election, Brazile denied leaking the questions to Clinton. But in a March 17, 2017, column for Time magazine, she finally admitted doing so, saying it was a  mistake I will forever regret. According to WND, their Twitter account was suspended because of this Seth Rich investigation bombshell.Daily Caller   But Brazile says she had a  spook,  with connections to the intelligence community, who told her after the killing that she needed protection for herself, including cameras, alarms and backup power at her house, and that she heeded his advice.I knew the campaign had over $3 million set aside in a legal fund. Could she help me get this lawsuit started? And don t forget the murder of Seth Rich, I told her. Did she want to contribute to Seth s reward fund? We still hadn t found the person responsible for the tragic murder of this bright young DNC staffer. You re right, she said. We re going to get to that. But she really had to go. She had made the call and checked it off her list, and I accepted after we said our goodbyes that I might never hear from her again.",politics,"Nov 7, 2017"
"HOW CAN ANYONE TRUST THEM? TWITTER Admits To Hiding ANTI-HILLARY and Negative DNC Tweets During Election","The move by a Twitter employee last week to ban President Trump from the social media platform for 11 minutes received a great deal of attention and offered people a glimpse into how easily someone at Twitter can stop the flow of information from a source he does not like.What did not get a great deal of attention, however, was the fact that Twitter s Acting General Counsel, Sean Edgett, admitted in a prepared statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee that the platform regularly blocked tweets offering information that could paint the Clinton Campaign and DNC in negative lights.Writing for NewsWars, Jerome Corsi notes:At a hearing of the Senate Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism on Tuesday, Sean Edgett, Acting General Counsel for Twitter, admitted in his prepared testimony that Twitter employed in the 2016 election algorithms that censored out hashtags critical (of) Hillary Clinton, including the hashtag #PodestaEmails and the hashtag #DNCLeaks. Is anyone surprised?Twitter execs long ago began showing their biases against conservatives to such an extent that even USA Today brought it up, noting that Twitter s behind-the-scenes team was quick to ban right-wingers like Milo Yiannopoulos for digs he made at the brilliant and ever-so-entertaining actress Leslie Jones.Yet, conservatives say, nothing happened to rapper Talib Kweli and his followers when they attacked black Breitbart reporter Jerome Hudson with racial slurs. When Breitbart contributor Kassy Dillon complained about a Twitter user who sent her harassing tweets and messages, Twitter made the perpetrator delete one tweet that suggested someone shoot Dillon in the head. Now, the big story that many in the pop media evidently don t want you to see is that Twitter actually admits to having censored tweets that might have spread real information injurious to HRC and the DNC during the 2016 election. The Twits claim that they were simply stopping  spambots  from filling their precious space with tweets from unreal people (one might ask how authentic most politicians seem to be in the first place, but that s a different matter), but hidden in their statements are some  tells  that indicate otherwise.For example, Dr. Corsi observes that in sworn testimony to the Judiciary Committee, Edgett stated:For example, our automated spam detection systems helped mitigate the impact of automated Tweets promoting the #PodestaEmails hashtag, which originated with Wikileaks  publication of thousands of emails from the Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta s Gmail account. The core of the hashtag was propagated by Wikileaks, whose account sent out a series of 118 original Tweets containing variants on the hashtag #PodestaEmails referencing the daily installments of the emails released on the Wikileaks website.So, automatically, what Mr. Edgett has admitted tells us that Twitter intentionally tried to stop the circulation of information offered by an authentic user, Wikileaks, offering authentic information that Wikileaks had published revealing real, confirmed e-mails sourced from John Podesta and the DNC. Those e-mails shed extremely important information about corruption within the DNC that worked against Bernie Sanders  campaign, and in favor of Mrs. Clinton s campaign, and later revealed extremely important information about what Mrs. Clinton knew about the attempted overthrow of Syria and the underlying, unconstitutional reasons for the overthrow of Qaddafi in Libya.Edgett also testified that Twitter hid 25% of the  #PodestaEmails  tweets, andAs described in greater detail below, our systems detected and hid just under half (48%) of the Tweets relating to variants of another notable hashtag, #DNCLeak, which concerned the disclosure of leaked emails from the Democratic National Committee. Those would be the e-mails that revealed towering corruption at the DNC and in many offices of pop media   things like new reporters working with the Clinton campaign to offer her easy questions, things like Donna Brazile, then an employee of CNN, feeding Hillary questions prior to a debate with the electrifying wildman, Bernie Sanders.These are issues that were real, and the more people knew about them, the more they disliked Mrs. Clinton   and the more she and the DNC hackmeisters pushed the spurious  Russia Hack  narrative to deflect from their own malfeasance.For entire story- MRCTV ",politics,"Nov 6, 2017"
"AIR FORCE ERROR Allowed Texas Church Gunman To Buy Guns","A CHECK AND BALANCE BETWEEN THE MILITARY AND THE NCIS NEEDS TO BE PUT IN PLACE!As more details come out on the motive behind the Texas church shooting, the Air Force came out and admitted they didn t file the criminal record and court-martial  into the federal database Horrible! The angry man has a history of aggression and violence. His former in-laws belonged to the church that was the scene of the massacre of innocent churchgoers:Kelly was on bad terms with his wife s mother, Michelle Shields (pictured below), who was a member of the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs where the massacre took place on Sunday. He had been sending threatening texts to her on the morning of the shooting. At an afternoon press conference, police revealed that Kelley had  expressed anger towards his mother-in-law  and sent her  threatening texts . She was not in the church but her mother was killed in the church.

We re with President Trump and believe that this man s mental health problem is the issue here .HOW WAS HE ABLE TO GET GUNS?A sporting goods store in San Antonio just reported they sold a weapon to Kelley. They obviously had none of the information they needed in the background check to refuse the sale of the gun.AIR FORCE MISHANDLING OF RECORDSA day after a gunman massacred parishioners in a small Texas church, the Air Force admitted on Monday that it had failed to enter the man s domestic violence court-martial into a federal database that could have blocked him from buying the rifle he used to kill 26 people.The conviction of the gunman, Devin P. Kelley, for domestic assault on his wife and infant stepson   he had cracked the child s skull   should have stopped Mr. Kelley from legally purchasing the military-style rifle and three other guns he bought in the last four years. But that information was never entered by the Air Force into the federal database for background checks on gun purchasers, the service said. The Air Force has launched a review of how the service handled the criminal records of former Airman Devin P. Kelley following his 2012 domestic violence conviction,  the Air Force said in a statement.  Federal law prohibited him from buying or possessing firearms after this conviction. The statement said that Heather Wilson, the Air Force secretary, and Gen. David Goldfein, the Air Force chief of staff, had ordered the Air Force inspector general to work with the Pentagon s inspector general to  conduct a complete review of the Kelley case and relevant policies and procedures. The Air Force also said that it was looking into whether other convictions had been improperly left unreported.  The service will also conduct a comprehensive review of Air Force databases to ensure records in other cases have been reported correctly,  the statement said.",politics,"Nov 6, 2017"

"WHY DID TEXAS SHOOTER Shave His Beard Only Days Before He Massacred 26 in Local Baptist Church?","At least 26 people have been killed inside a Texas church   including a two-year-old child   after a gunman dressed in full combat gear opened fire during the morning service before cops shot him dead.Confirmed reports are beginning to circulate that the shooter is a left-wing Antifa member, Devin Patrick Kelley (26), with military experience, acting out on behalf of the previously promoted November 4th Resistance via Antifa.  Kelley is a former U.S. Air Force member who served from 2010 to 2014. He was dishonorably discharged and court-martialed in May 2014, CBS News has learned. (Via CBS) [ ] Kelley is a former U.S. Air Force member who served from 2010 to 2014. Records confirm Kelley previously served in logistics readiness in New Mexico until his discharge in 2014, Air Force spokesperson Ann Stefanek said in a statement.Kelley was court-martialed in 2012 for two counts of assault on his spouse and assault on their child, Stefanek said. He received a bad conduct discharge and confinement for 12 months. He has a residence in New Braunfels, Texas, which is about a 35-mile drive from where the attack took place in Sutherland Springs.   Conservative TreehouseKelley showed off an image of a rifle on his Facebook page, calling it a  bad bitch :Although gun-control advocates will use Kelley as an example of why no American should be able to legally own a gun, it s worth pointing out that, given Kelley s dishonorable discharge from the Air Force, which is a felony, he would be banned from possessing a firearm in the U.S.:If Devin Kelley was dishonorably discharged from military it would mean he couldn t have legally bought a gun.

His profile picture showed two small children, which was a chilling juxtaposition next to the semi-automatic rifle that was his cover photo. According to The Daily Beast,  Kelley was married and Kelley s mother-in-law listed a P.O. box in Sutherland Springs as a mailing address. San Antonio police reportedly raided Kelley s home on Sunday evening he briefly taught at a summer Bible school.  He lived about 35 miles from the shooting scene.The shooter was described as a  white male in his 20s from outside San Antonio  by Mike Levine, a journalist for ABC News, who reported that law enforcement had uncovered a weapon photo on Kelley s Facebook page.  Authorities are now scrubbing his social media; on Facebook in recent days, he showed off an AR-15 style-looking gun,  Levine wrote. Authorities said the rifle used in the massacre was similar to the one Kelley posted on Facebook, but they could not confirm it was the same weapon.  HeavyKelley s Facebook page revealed that had recently shaved his beard. It s Kelley s response to a friend who asked him,  Don t you have a beard?  that s curious. Kelley s responded,  Not anymore. Long story. Although there is no evidence so far that indicates Kelley was radicalized by Islam, it s common knowledge, that before a Muslim commits jihad, they are to be cleanly shaven.Slate magazine explains why a terrorist shaves before blowing himself up:So he s clean when he enters heaven. Traditionally, Muslims purify corpses by washing the skin and nails and sometimes by shaving the pubic hair. But suicide attackers are deprived of a proper burial since there are usually no remains. To compensate, the attackers shear themselves ahead of time, both to guarantee some level of cleanliness at the time of instant incineration and to prove extreme devotion to personal purity. Some scholars offer an alternative explanation: They believe that suicide terrorists adopted the no-hair practice from the Pashtun tribesmen of Afghanistan, who shave their bodies before going into battle.Hair removal is mentioned in Islamic law as a method of maintaining personal hygiene. In addition to nail clipping, the sunnah instructs Muslim men and women to shave or trim pubic hair regularly and to remove underarm hair. Men must also clip their mustaches. In some circumstances, Muslims are encouraged to shave their heads. For example, Al-Bukhari, a ninth-century Muslim scholar who spent years collecting hadith, quotes the prophet as saying  May Allah bless those who shaved  during the Hajj (pilgrimage); and the Quran states that  ye shall enter the Sacred Mosque, if Allah wills, with minds secure, heads shaved, hair cut short, and without fear.

"WOW! DONNA BRAZILE Tells Critics Of Her Book On DNC To Go To Hell In Exclusive Interview [Video]","Donna Brazile might want to watch her back! She shot back at critics (the Hillary camp) of her new book that alleges proof of a rigged Democratic 2016 primary, saying they can  go to hell. This is a lesson of 2016,  Brazile said on ABC s This Week.   If I released it next year, they would say,  Donna, you re impacting our 2018 races For those who are telling me to shut up, they told Hillary that a couple of months ago. You know what I tell them? Go to hell. I m going to tell my story. In an exclusive interview with ABC s  Stephanopoulos, Brazile angrily defended her description of events in the book Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns that Put Donald Trump in the White House. In the book, she describes a dysfunctional, debt-ridden DNC she took over after the ouster of Debbie Wasserman Schultz.Brazile has sharp words for her and President Barack Obama for their financial mismanagement of the DNC, and she also rips the Clinton campaign for treating her poorly and having  stupid  and  stiff  messages.RUSSIAN PROPAGANDA?More than 100 Clinton staffers, including campaign manager Robby Mook and top aide Huma Abedin, signed a scathing letter about Brazile s book, accusing her of buying into Russian propaganda about Clinton s health and painting a picture of the campaign that wasn t true. If they don t like my book, don t buy it,  Brazile said of the letter. I ve gotten emails from Democrats, passionate Democrats, who say they feel betrayed by all of this. Any regrets?  Stephanopoulos asked. Do I regret taking on the job cleaning up everybody s mess?  Brazile asked.  Taking all of the incoming? Being unable to spend funds that I raised? Do I regret being on the road 100 percent of the time? Being hacked by the Russians? Being harassed? Getting death threats? Do I regret any of that? Brazile said this was  worse than Hurricane Katrina  in terms of the emotional toll for her.Brazile was asked if she mentioned dropping Clinton for Biden to top Clinton staffer Charlie Baker, Brazile snapped,  I kept my own counsel.

"JIM BEAM Fans Call For Boycott After Spokesperson and Liberal Actress Brags About Taunting VP Mike Pence For Defending Life","The decision of actress Mila Kunis to make monthly donations to abortion business Planned Parenthood in pro-life Vice President Mike Pence s name has generated a call for a boycott of Jim Beam on Twitter.Jim Beam global brand spokesperson Kunis told Conan O Brien Thursday that she donates to Planned Parenthood in Pence s name to protest his pro-life policies. O Brien asked Kunis to explain her  prank: I apologize if I m offending anybody. It s not so much a prank as much as I disagreed with some of the stuff that Pence was doing and was trying to do. And so as a reminder that there are women out there in the world that may or may not agree with his platform, I put him on a list of recurring donations that are made in his name to Planned Parenthood.Every month, to his office, he gets a little letter that says like,  An anonymous donation has been made in your name.  I don t look at it as a prank, this is like, I strongly disagree, and this is my little way of doing it. It s a peaceful protest.  Breitbart NewsThe new face of Jim Beam, the iconic bourbon brand, might not be quite what you expect. While a rough-around-the-edges cowboy or country rock star might seem to fit the bill Jim Beam has used Kid Rock at times in the past its newest spokesperson is the petite and beautiful Mila Kunis.The 30-year-old actress, who says she is a big fan of bourbon in general, is featured in two new 30-second Beam ads, as well as five other videos ranging in length from 15 seconds to more than three minutes.

"Former DNC Chair Felt Like A Slave& Wanted to Replace Hillary With One Of Two Options After Fainting Spell Gave Campaign Odor of Failure","Donna Brazile lets it rip on the Hillary Clinton campaign in her new book about the 2016 election. She s definitely not holding back in her scathing review of the Clinton operation during 2016. She says she felt like a slave and felt disrespected by the Clinton campaign members. What s the most interesting is that she had two people in mind when she was discussing replacing Hillary after the fainting spell on 9/11. She says she just couldn t do it because she didn t want to let women down LOL! Sure!SECRET DELIBERATIONS Donna Brazile held secret deliberations to discuss using her power as interim chair of the Democratic National Committee to replace Hillary Clinton as the party s nominee after the former first lady suffered a fainting spell on the campaign trail last September, she writes in her bombshell memoir.The Washington Post reports that Brazile reveals in her memoir that she considered replacing Clinton with then-Vice President Joe Biden or New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker because of the former secretary of state s  anemic  campaign.JOE BIDEN THE GROPERClinton s effort, which carried with it an  odor of failure,  was struggling to appeal to white working-class voters, writes Brazile in the book,  Hacks: The Inside Story of the Break-ins and Breakdowns That Put Donald Trump in the White House. The Post obtained an advance copy of the 288-page memoir, which will be released on Tuesday.REMEMBER THIS?Brazile, a longtime Democratic consultant who managed Al Gore s 2000 White House bid, says that she first became concerned about Clinton s health on Sept. 9, following an event in Manhattan.Brazile said that Clinton appeared  wobbly on her feet  with a  rattled cough,  according to The Post.As acting chairwoman of the DNC, Brazile had the power to replace the party s nominee if they became disabled. Brazile reminded the Clinton campaign of that authority, which was included in the DNC charter.Clinton s fainting spell triggered talk inside Democratic circles that Brazile could exercise that authority. She said that Biden s chief of staff contacted her a day after Clinton passed out. Gee, I wonder what he wanted to talk to me about?  she said to herself, she recalls in her book.Brazile writes that she heavily considered appointing Biden but could not pull the trigger to replace the first female nominee for president. Again and again I thought about Joe Biden,  Brazile writes, according to The Post. No matter my doubts and my fears about the election and Hillary as a candidate, I could not make good on that threat to replace her. I thought of Hillary, and all the women in the country who were so proud of and excited about her. I could not do this to them. I FELT LIKE A SLAVE As one of her party s most prominent black strategists, Brazile also recounts fiery disagreements with Clinton s staffers   including a conference call in which she told three senior campaign officials, Charlie Baker, Marlon Marshall and Dennis Cheng, that she was being treated like a slave. I m not Patsey the slave,  Brazile recalls telling them, a reference to the character played by Lupita Nyong o in the film,  12 Years a Slave.

"DID MILITARY JUDGE Give Army Deserter Bowe Bergdahl A Slap On The Wrist Because of President Trump?","Is this just one more case of an activist judge too blinded by his hate for Trump to deliver the justice he took an oath to uphold? It was announced yesterday that Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who walked away from his post in Afghanistan and triggered a search that left some of his comrades severely wounded, was spared a prison sentence by a military judge Friday in what President Donald Trump blasted as a  complete and total disgrace. The judge gave no explanation of how he arrived at his decision, but he reviewed evidence that included the five years Bergdahl was held captive by the Taliban and the wounds suffered by troops who searched for him, including one who now uses a wheelchair and cannot speak.  Chicago TribuneWhen candidate Donald Trump told a crowd that Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl should have been executed for leaving his post in Afghanistan, the crowd cheered We re tired of Sgt. Bergdahl, who s a traitor, a no-good traitor, who should have been executed,  Trump said to cheers at a rowdy rally inside a packed Las Vegas theater at the casino-hotel Treasure Island. Thirty years ago,  Trump added,  he would have been shot. Before everyone starts calling Trump  heartless  or an  idiot,  perhaps they should first familiarize themselves with our laws about Americans who commit treason:Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.(June 25, 1948, ch. 645, 62 Stat. 807; Pub. L. 103 322, title XXXIII,  330016(2)(J), Sept. 13, 1994, 108 Stat. 2148.)Immediately after the news broke about the slap on the wrist given to Bowe Bergdahl in his desertion case, President Trump tweeted about his disgust with the judge s decision:https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/926492915626663939President Trump s harsh criticism of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who walked off his Army post in Afghanistan in 2009 and was captured by the Taliban, will weigh in favor of a lighter sentence for the sergeant, a military judge said on Monday. I will consider the president s comments as mitigation evidence as I arrive at an appropriate sentence,  the judge, Col. Jeffery R. Nance of the Army, said during a hearing at Fort Bragg. The judge is expected to sentence Sergeant Bergdahl in the next few weeks.The judge rejected a request that he dismiss the case or cap the length of the sentence on the grounds that the president s comments had precluded a fair hearing. The judge said he had not been influenced by the remarks and that the public s confidence in the military justice system had not been undermined.Sergeant Bergdahl faces up to life imprisonment. He pleaded guilty on Oct. 16 to desertion and endangering the troops who were sent to search for him.He testified on Monday that he deeply regretted that people  suffered because of my bad choices. Colonel Nance will also consider aggravating factors presented by the prosecution, including injuries suffered by several service members during the search for Sergeant Bergdahl, as well as the negative impact they say the search had on the military s overall war effort in Afghanistan.Anger over the injuries has driven much of the testimony in the case so far, as service members vividly described a rescue operation that exposed them to enemy fire. Shannon Allen, the wife of Sgt. First Class Mark Allen, who was shot in the head took the stand on Monday.Sergeant Allen, a national guardsman from Georgia, had part of his brain removed during surgery, and is now unable to speak, walk, or take care of himself. His wife has said little publicly, but in a Facebook post after Sergeant Bergdahl was freed, she blamed him for causing her husband s incapacitation. Instead of being his wife, I have become his caregiver,  Ms. Allen testified on Monday.Last week, Staff Sgt. Jason Walters testified that his six-man team had only just arrived in Afghanistan when they were sent to search for Sergeant Bergdahl. They had little time to prepare for the rugged terrain of Paktika Province, and little intelligence to go on.On the second morning of the search,  an insane amount of fire came out of nowhere,  Sergeant Walters said. Militants had them surrounded. In minutes, half the team had been wounded. Sergeant Walters turned to see  a cloud of blood  spraying from the head of Sergeant Allen. I started treating his wounds, talking to him, telling him to hang on,  Sergeant Walters said.The battle subsided only after F-15 fighter jets and Apache helicopters arrived overhead.Only later would the troops learn that the battalion responsible for the area believed that 150 Taliban fighters were near the village where the soldiers were resting when they came under fire. My words can t take away what people have been through,  Sergeant Bergdahl told the court on Monday.  Offering condolences is not enough. People went through things they shouldn t have had to go through. I grieve for those who have suffered and their families. For entire story: NYT s ",politics,"Nov 4, 2017"

"OBAMA HID BIN LADEN PAPERS To Bury This Damning Evidence That Could Have Cost Him 2012 Election","The Obama administration s well guarded Osama bin Laden documents were released on Wednesday by CIA director Mike Pompeo. The documents were seized in a raid after U.S. SEAL Rob O Neill killed Osama bin Laden. The Obama administration basically politicized the intelligence agencies when they hand-picked just a few of the 470,000 documents to release. They hid damning evidence that could have hurt Obama s chance at reelection in 2012 .OBAMA RAN THE CLOCK OUT AL QAEDA WAS NOT  ON THE RUN :Steve Hayes of the Weekly Standard:  In a manner of speaking, Barack Obama wanted what al Qaeda already had: a mutually beneficial partnership with Tehran. Revealing to the American people the truth about Osama bin Laden s cozy working relationship with the Iranian government might have fatally undermined that diplomatic quest, just as the ongoing vitality of al Qaeda, amply testified to in the bin Laden documents, would have contradicted Obama s proud claims in 2012 that al Qaeda was  on the run.  So Obama, with the eager cooperation of some in the intelligence community, bottled up the bin Laden documents and ran out the clock.IRAN S CLOSE TIES TO AL QAEDA COULD HURT THE IRAN DEAL:Within the documents is an assessment by a senior jihadist with al Qaeda   Tehran ties: how Iran supplied  everything needed,  including  money, arms  and  training in Hezbollah camps in Lebanon,  including safe haven for other jihadis, the New York Post reported.The assessment is raising questions as to how much then-President Obama knew about Iran s ties to al Qaeda before making his controversial deal. And it points to the reason why the former administration might have kept the documents under lock and key.The Obama White House had this information for five years before making the nuclear deal that critics argued would ultimately make it easier for the terror state to build nuclear weapons. Bin Laden had called Iran a  main artery for funds, personnel and communication  for al Qaeda, the Post reported.That wasn t the only suspicious dealing Obama had with Iran. In August 2016, Republicans were furious over a reported deal Obama had made to release American hostages in Iran.The former administration denied paying $400 million in  ransom  for the hostages, arguing that it was part of a legal settlement in a long-standing case. However, it was only the first of three payments to the Iranians totaling $1.3 billion that took place after the hostage release, as the Wall Street Journal disclosed. And strikingly, much of the case came by way of plane-loads of cash in international currencies.But the revelations about bin Laden and the former administration don t end there.MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD CONNECTIONS TO BIN LADEN:In one of the 10,000 videos files contained within the newly released documents, bin Laden is asked to name is his influences. The terrorist leader didn t hesitate, The National reported. From a religious aspect, I was committed within the Muslim Brotherhood. Bin Laden also suggested the Muslim Brotherhood sponsored his first trip as a young jihadi. It was the first time I travelled to a country where I did not know the language,  he writes.  I carried a pistol and went. The Brotherhood, they had poor knowledge about things. If they knew, I would not have had to travel through Syria to Antakya 12 hours by bus to reach Istanbul. It was easier from Jeddah to Istanbul by plane. Three hours by plane. MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD CONNECTIONS TO CLINTONS:Critics of the Muslim Brotherhood have long warned of its terror affiliation and infiltration into the West.

Good for him A disabled Navy veteran said he declined to accept an award at a New Orleans Saints game due to the controversy over players protesting during the national anthem.The Saints organization was going to honor retired Cmdr.

Saints players have been seen kneeling before the anthem and some continue to do so during the national anthem. Although I am touched and honored to be selected for such an award, the ongoing controversy with NFL players  disrespect for the national flag forces me to decline to participate in the presentation,  Wells said.  I am unable, in good conscience, to enter an NFL stadium while this discourtesy prevails. Since this award is tainted with the dishonorable actions of the NFL and its players, I cannot accept it. Wells served in the Navy from 1972 to 1994 and afterward became an attorney concentrating in military and veterans law, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune.

"McCain Associate Who Handled Trump Dossier Is Accused Of Dodging Subpoena In BuzzFeed Lawsuit","Lawyers for a Russian tech executive suing BuzzFeed for publishing the Steele dossier say that a longtime associate of Arizona Sen. John McCain and two major news outlets are resisting subpoenas seeking their depositions for the case.In a brief filed in federal court late Wednesday, lawyers for the executive, Aleksej Gubarev, claim that David Kramer (pictured below), a former State Department official and McCain associate,  has been seemingly avoiding service  of a deposition subpoena for weeks.Please see the very curious input Reason.com put out just this July regarding Kramer s involvement in the Steele dossier getting into the hands of the press. And The New York Times and Wall Street Journal are challenging deposition subpoenas they have been served as part of the case.Gubarev s lawyers are attempting to find out who gave BuzzFeed the salacious dossier, which the website published to much controversy on Jan. 10.The dossier, written by former British spy Christopher Steele, alleges that Gubarev and his companies, XBT Holdings and Webzilla, used spam, viruses and porn bots to hack into DNC computer systems. Gubarev vehemently denies the allegations.Gubarev s attorneys say that identifying BuzzFeed s source could shed light on whether the news outlet was warned that information in the dossier could be false. They argue that publishing the dossier despite such warnings would show  reckless disregard for the truth or falsity of the information published. BuzzFeed has defended its decision to publish the dossier, which was financed by the Clinton campaign and DNC and commissioned by opposition research firm Fusion GPS. It is also resisting demands from Gubarev s team to identify its dossier source on the grounds that it would violate its First Amendment protections as a news-gathering organization.Via: Daily CallerReason had this to say on July 16th on the mystery surrounding how the fake dossier got into the hands of Buzzed:Did John McCain and a controversial D.C. lobbying group conspire to get the infamous  pee dossier  into the hands of the press?A lawsuit making its way through court in the UK hopes to determine just what role the senator and his associates had in making the lurid dossier public.New filings in the lawsuit, obtained by McClatchy, detail how David Kramer employed by the nonprofit and purportedly non-political McCain Institute acted as a representative of McCain in the Arizona senator s dealings on sensitive intelligence measures:According to a new court document in the British lawsuit, counsel for defendants Steele and Orbis repeatedly point to McCain, R-Ariz., a vocal Trump critic, and a former State Department official as two in a handful of people known to have had copies of the full document before it circulated among journalists and was published by BuzzFeed.

"APOLOGY ISSUED After LA TIMES and NY TIMES Columnists Go After #SarahSanders: Mock Her Weight And Southern Accent","Wow! What a couple of hypocrites and haters! We ve included contact info for the two male liberal columnists below so you can let them know how tacky and disgraceful they are for mocking Sarah Sanders.UPDATE: HORSEY ISSUED AN APOLOGY AFTER BACKLASH BUT HIS CARTOON IS STILL IN THE ARTICLE! I want to apologize to Times readers   and to Sarah Huckabee Sanders   for a description that was insensitive and failed to meet the standards of our newspaper. It also failed to meet the expectations I have for myself. It surely won t be my last mistake, but this particular error will be scrupulously avoided in my future commentaries. I ve removed the offending description.   David HorseySHE MUST BE GETTING UNDER THEIR SKIN:Two male, liberal columnists this week launched personal attacks against White House press secretary Sarah Sanders.DAVID HORSEY OF LA TIMES:Los Angeles Times columnist David Horsey mocked Sanders  appearance (he later deleted this part), saying she  looks more like a slightly chunky soccer mom who organizes snacks for the kids  games. Rather than the fake eyelashes and formal dresses she puts on for news briefings, Sanders seems as if she d be more comfortable in sweats and running shoes,  Horsey wrote on Wednesday.  Yet, even if Trump privately wishes he had a supermodel for a press secretary, he is lucky to have Sanders. He s also a cartoonist. This horrible cartoon of Sanders is with the article:  BIG MOTHER ???Please contact Horsey on twitter to let him know what a total jerk he is to mock a woman like this: David Horsey TwitterNY TIMES BASHES SANDERS TOO:Another columnist, the New York Times  Frank Bruni, similarly went out of his way on Friday to bash Sanders for her personal characteristics, in this case her way of speaking.Bruni wrote that Sanders is serving a function other than communication, which turns out not to be her forte. To listen to her pronounce  priorities  is akin to hearing the air seep out of a flat tire, and she leaves half of the consonants on the curb,  Bruni added parenthetically, mocking Sanders for her Southern accent.Bruni calls Sanders a phony:  She s a bogus message to Middle America that Trump s White House is really a homespun, family-values kind of places. Please contact Bruni on twitter: Frank Bruni TwitterNice try, but Sanders is as real as they come. THAT S what bothers these two so-called journalists who just did a hit piece on a woman for her looks and her Southern accent NOT for the job she s doing as press secretary. Is this all they ve got? Nice try boys, we re even bigger fans now of this imperfect (who is perfect?) but incredible woman who stepped in and is hitting a home run for the Trump team Go Sarah!

[VIDEO]","If you haven t discovered Austen Fletcher yet, please check him out on twitter and YouTube He goes in and opens up lefty brains with shocking facts He s awesome!Communist calls Trump supporting high school students 'white supremacists'. Hilarity ensues! #FleccasTalkshttps://t.co/M7VCVpmEUV pic.twitter.com/JHpygavsZw  Austen Fletcher (@fleccas) November 2, 2017The entire video is below:Students at Cal State Fullerton attempted to shut down Milo Yiannopoulis  right to free speech. They end up looking like idiots!Townhall covered the idiocy:Halloween Night at Cal State Fullerton, I got to engage the crowd of students who would be protesting free speech absolutist and conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos. I didn t want to hear him. I wanted to meet the students, see the force of outrage against his presence on the campus, and start changing some minds.In the beginning, I noticed that some protesters were wearing masks. Law enforcement surrounded and arrested one of them. Later that night, another Antifa thug got taken down after pepper-spraying others. Perhaps it s time for local law enforcement to deputize the law-abiding citizens to arrest those who wear masks and menace peace-loving protesters.Like many others in the student quad, I came in my own custom: Arthur, i.e. Arthur Reed the cartoon anteater (or Aardvark). It works, don t you think? Other costumes included Hugh Hefner, a pirate wrapped in rainbow feather boas, and a snowflake liberal. The last one was a young man wearing bubble wrap all over his body. Funny stuff!As soon as I arrived at the square, reporters and student journalists rushed towards me. One guy asked me which was worse, feminism or cancer. I said  both . Other students wanted to know why I was there, including the mainstream media reporters. I want free speech restored and respected on college campuses, and I want to debunk the lies and mythologies about President Trump.Within minutes, a crazed black woman later identified as Keyanna Celina roared at me:  White Supremacist! Get out of here!  My friend Genevieve Peters tried to calm the situation. Instead, Celina swiped at her, then beat her around the head multiple times before someone in the crowd fired pepper spray to stop Celina.Right on cue, the anti-Milo, anti-free speech fascists started chanting  Fascists go home! Fascists go home!  Instead of running away, I stood right in front of their protest, turned the cameras on them and shouted with them:  Fascists go home!  Trick or treat!Full disclosure: I am no Milo fan. But so what? He has every right to speak at a college, and no one should prevent him! Besides, I was more interested in listening to students, to find out why they were protesting, to get their views on key issues, and to stump for President Trump. Some students accused me of starting fights. I soon realized they were merely trying to silence me. After deftly casting accusations aside, I began to realize why abject liberalism had taken hold on many of these young people. Obviously, they don t hear other points of view, and thus anyone with a difference of opinion is wrong. As I feared, most students are told what to think, not how to think. Another problem was the sloppy misuse of terms. One man claimed that 75% of the businesses in socialist dystopia Venezuela are privately owned. Uh   Nope! Why would he believe this? Because he didn t see the clear synonym between nationalization and socialization.",politics,"Nov 3, 2017"

The entire video is so full of reports on  scandal after scandal but the one towards the end is most disturbing. Here s the one that is most important as it relates to Obama:Please go to the 23:55 point for the information on the uranium sale:HANNITY:  Barack Obama purposely manipulated the process to allow this trucking company to be the conduit by which they got the uranium out of the country. Tell us what you found. JOHN SOLOMON HAD THIS SHOCKING REVELATION:SOLOMON:  Yeah, there wasn t just one decision, we look at Uranium One and say we let them buy the mine and 20% of the ore that was being mined at that time under there control. But there was a series of decisions made by the Obama administration time and time again, between 2010 and 2012 that are incredibly favorable to Russia s ROSATOM, the state owned nuclear energy industry, time and again these decisions are being made while the FBI knowns that there criminality going on by that company s executives HANNITY:  The bribery, exhortation, money laundering, the racketeering, and so on. SOLOMON:  Yeah, Kickbacks. And theres a second thing that I m just starting to report on now.

"MARK LEVIN: AL QAEDA and ISIS Actively Using Schumers Diversity Visa Program To Put Sleepers In Our Country [VIDEO]","Two nights ago, Mark Levin dropped a bombshell on his show about the Muslim terrorist who killed 9 people in Manhattan and injured dozens. The Diversity VISA immigration program that allowed the Muslim terrorist, and 23 people who were tied to his lottery draw from Uzbekistan to live in the United States, was given the brainchild of none other than New York s own Democrat senator, Chuck Schumer.Mark Levin; NYC muslim terrorist came to US under  Diversity VISA Program    a bizarre lottery to shove more foreigners down our throats  Deplorable MD   (@MDDeplorable) October 31, 2017Numbers USA breaks down Senator Chuck Schumer s Diversity Visa immigration program: The Irish Immigration Reform Movement (IIRM) began working directly with Rep. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and his staff to draft a diversity program that differed significantly from those considered up to that point. The Schumer proposal would have set aside 75,000 visas each year for a new category of  diversity immigrants. 112 Under this proposal, the world would be separated into  high-admission regions  and  low-admission regions,  within which would be  high-admission states  and  low-admission states.  High-admission states would be those from which at least 25,000 immigrants had come to the United States within the most recent five-year period. While no state would be allocated more than seven percent of available visas, the bulk of visas would go to low-admission states in low-admission regions, with a much smaller number allotted to low-admission states in high-admission regions. Any visas not used by the state to which they were allocated would go to the remaining eligible states.Last night, nationally syndicated radio talk show host Mark Levin slammed the Diversity Immigrant Visa (green card lottery) program in an interview with Sean Hannity on FOX News Tuesday night. He said a lottery is no way to run an immigration system. Levin said a caller, a counter-intelligence veteran, told him al Qaeda and ISIS are  actively  using the program to install sleeper cells in the U.S It took effect in 1995,  Levin said of the bill.  People go online and they apply. They apply online. It s a lottery system. That is no way to run immigration system. I had a caller on my radio program tonight and he said, he used to work counterintelligence. Al Qaeda and ISIS have actively been working to use this program to put sleepers in our country. Levin said we have forgotten what the purpose of immigration is. Immigration is supposed to benefit the United States, not to ensure diversity from the foreigners coming into this country. Immigration is supposed to improve the United States it has nothing to do with improving other countries and so forth,  he said. This mass killer has claimed an association with ISIS, hasn t he? This diversity visa program should be gutted. We don t need a diversity visa program with 50,000 people a year come into this country through a lottery system, because we want diversity from different countries,  Levin declared.Levin said after 9/11, you would have thought people would take the issue of immigration more seriously. Immigration is about national security,  the broadcaster said.  Once people get into the country it becomes far more complicated. So you want to stop them at the border. And when the President of the United States said, as he did when he first came into office, we can t vet these people. Some of these governments are effective war with us and some of them don t exist. Some of them are involved in civil war. You know, we can t call Yemen and say, hey, can you check this guy out on your computer system? There is no computer system. There is no effective government. What the President is saying is  you can t bring people in from these countries until we figure out what s going on.   Real Clear Politics",politics,"Nov 2, 2017"

"LIZ WARREN Admits To Jake Tapper 2016 Primary Election Was Rigged [Video]","Liz Warren flips She just told Jake Tapper in an interview that the Dem Primary was rigged. We all knew this it s pretty huge for her to say it DONNA BRAZILE ALSO SPILLED THE BEANS WITH HER NEW BOOK: After months of lying about passing debate questions to Hillary before the presidential debate that was hosted by her employer, CNN, the former DNC Chair Donna Brazile, finally came clean. During an interview with Trevor Noah of the Daily Show, Brazile arrogantly excused her dishonest behavior by telling Noah: Well, first of all, I didn t have my hands in the cookie jar. I m an operative, I m a strategist, and part of what my role was, in addition to being a  political pundit,  was to help advance the cause of justice and equality Today s a new day, however, and Donna Brazile has decided to emerge from the shadows to promote her new bombshell, tell-all book that is sure to ruffle a few feathers in the Democrat Party Her book is about the chaos at the DNC during the 2016 campaign. On Thursday, she revealed a section of it at Politico. What emerges from the excerpt is a picture of Brazile as a heroine (of course), Hillary Clinton as the villainess, Debbie Wasserman Schultz as incompetent and lazy, and Barack Obama as the unnamed cancer that ate away at the center of the party.Ouch.In Brazile s book, she claims that Obama cleaned out the Party. Brazile writes that by the time she took over, the Democratic Party was  broke and $2 million in debt.  According to Brazile, Obama  left the party $24 million in debt    hey, sort of like the country!   and his campaign wouldn t pay off that debt until election year. Furthermore, Wasserman Schultz had grown staff and allowed the DNC to pick up the check for Obama consultants.Brazile also claims that Hillary ran the Party. Hillary used that debt to pick up power   they pledged to fill in the funding gap for the DNC so long as they got to run operations. Gary Gensler, CFO of the Hillary campaign, apparently  described the party as fully under the control of Hillary s campaign, which seemed to confirm the suspicions of the Bernie camp. The campaign had the DNC on life support, giving it money every month to meet its basic expenses, while the campaign was using the party as a fund-raising clearinghouse. Hillary Essentially Laundered Campaign Money Through The DNC. Hillary raised an enormous amount of money for the DNC, but virtually all that money went to Hillary s campaign. Less than half of 1 percent of all money Hillary raised from her fundraisers went to the states. Brazile explains:When the Politico story described this arrangement as  essentially   money laundering  for the Clinton campaign, Hillary s people were outraged at being accused of doing something shady. Bernie s people were angry for their own reasons, saying this was part of a calculated strategy to throw the nomination to Hillary.The party ran as an adjunct to the Hillary campaign long before the primaries, meaning that Bernie was at a severe disadvantage. Brazile admits as much:The funding arrangement with HFA and the victory fund agreement was not illegal, but it sure looked unethical. If the fight had been fair, one campaign would not have control of the party before the voters had decided which one they wanted to lead.For entire story: Daily Wire",politics,"Nov 2, 2017"
"VIOLENT ENVIRONMENTAL LUNATICS Cost Taxpayers MILLIONS To Protect Trumps EPA Director After Receiving Unprecedented Number of Credible Death Threats","Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt has received an unprecedented amount of death threats, requiring a 24-hour security detail, according to an editorial published in the Wall Street Journal.The paper revealed the EPA has received more than 70  credible threats against EPA staffers, with a disproportionate number menacing Administrator Scott Pruitt and his family,  since President Donald Trump took office.Credible threats from liberal opponents have resulted in the EPA s inspector general s office recommending 24/7 security detail for Pruitt, which is costing taxpayers $2 million per year. Mr. Pruitt has received more than five times as many threats as his predecessor, Gina McCarthy,  the editorial explained.  These include explicit death threats. Some have referenced Mr. Pruitt s home address. Federal law enforcement has determined that some of those threatening Mr. Pruitt are likely capable of carrying out acts of violence. Democratic lawmakers have complained that the security detail is a waste of money, claiming  there is no apparent security threat against the administrator to justify such a security detail or expenditures. EPA security has already caught suspects prowling around the Administrator s neighborhood,  the Journal reported.Liberals have justified the death threats. Last week, a San Francisco columnist argued death threats against Pruitt were justified because he is a  banally evil, milquetoast, science-denying government administrator.  The death threats  make a warped sort of sense,  wrote liberal columnist Mark Morford. Mr. Pruitt didn t invent these threats, and Cabinet members shouldn t have to fear violence as a price of public service,  the WSJ editorial board said.For entire story: WFB",politics,"Nov 2, 2017"
"NAMES REVEALED Of TOP DONOR And Popular ACTRESS Behind Disgusting Leftist Latino TV Ad Depicting White Man Running Down Minority Kids With Truck","When a disgusting ad appeared on TV showing a white man in a pick-up truck with a confederate flag in the back, and an Ed Gillespie for Governor bumper sticker on the gate, that was chasing down a group of minority kids in their neighborhood, Americans from every political party were disgusted. Many were asking who in the world was behind the Latino Victory Fund that sponsored the disgusting ad? Well, Washington Free Beacon did some digging, and as it turns out, the same person who funds violent riots, Antifa anti-free speech uprisings, or violent anti-Trump protests is also behind the funding of this horrible and divisive group whose co-founder is a well-known leftist actress. Liberal billionaire George Soros is a major funder of a Latino activist group that produced an ad in Virginia depicting a supporter of Republican gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie running down minority children in a truck, which was pulled following the New York City terror attack that left eight people dead.The group was part of Soros-backed efforts against Trump and Republicans during the 2016 election cycle, and its leadership includes individuals who previously worked directly with Soros at his foundation.The Latino Victory Fund, a group that carries a mission of  growing Latino political power by increasing Latino representation at every level of government,  released the advertisement showing a man driving a pickup truck with a Gillespie campaign bumper sticker chasing minority children down streets and alleyways.  Is this what Donald Trump and Ed Gillespie mean by  the American dream?'  the voiceover says in the ad.Crist bal J. Alex, the president of the Latino Victory, said the ad was produced to show how Gillespie has  eagerly embraced racism and xenophobia  during the campaign. The group pulled the ad following the terror attack in New York City on Tuesday and issued a non-apology when announcing the move. We knew our ad would ruffle feathers,  Alex said in a statement late Tuesday night.  We held a mirror up to the Republican Party, and they don t like what they see. We have decided to pull our ad at this time. Given recent events, we will be placing other powerful ads into rotation that highlight the reasons we need to elect progressive leaders in Virginia. Here s the disgusting ad:Latino Victory was co-founded by actress Eva Longoria and San Antonio-based businessman Henry R. Mu oz III, who has chaired the DNC s finance committee since 2013. Longoria and Mu oz previously operated the Futuro Fund, which raised $32 million for Barack Obama s reelection efforts.Soros is the top individual donor to the Latino Victory Fund this year and has given $150,000 to the group, Federal Election Commission filings show. The Congressional Hispanic Caucus (CHC) BOLD PAC, the fundraising arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, also gave $150,000 to the Latino Victory Fund.Soros produced funding for a campaign last year that involved the group.Numerous immigration activist groups, including Latino Victory, the Center for Community Change, and America s Voice, launched  Families Fight Back  during the 2016 election cycle.The Washington Free Beacon recently obtained unredacted tax documents revealing donors for the Center for Community Change, which does not disclose their contributors. Soros gave millions in funding to the group. It also received funding from the likes of the Ford Foundation, which was first created by members of the Ford Motor Company, but is no longer connected to the company.Three others who work at Latino Victory came from the failed presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.

"FAMILY FEUD? Why President Trump Is Reportedly Blaming Jared Kushner For Mueller Indictments","Is the last man standing in the West Wing about to be packing his bags?

Somehow, Jared Kushner has managed to stay put:Breitbart   Donald Trump reportedly blames his son-in-law, White House Senior Adviser Jared Kushner, for his role in the decision to appoint special counsel Robert Mueller, according to Vanity Fair s Gabriel Sherman.On a phone call Tuesday with Breitbart News Executive Chairman and former White House Chief Strategist Stephen K. Bannon,  Trump blamed Jared Kushner for his role in decisions, specifically the firings of [former National Security Adviser] Mike Flynn and [former FBI Director] James Comey, that led to Mueller s appointment,  according to a source who was briefed on the call.On Monday, Mueller indicted Trump s former campaign chair Paul Manafort on 12 counts   ranging from making false statements to  conspiracy against the United States    as part of the ongoing, so-called  Russia Investigation.  Richard Gates, Manafort s deputy, was also charged.The New York Times reported that Kushner, along with his wife Ivanka Trump, also pushed Trump to hire Manafort, who was needed to fill the spot of Trump s initial campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, after Ivanka reportedly gave her father an ultimatum to fire him.While Mueller s charges bear no immediate connection to Trump or his campaign, Sherman reports that everyone in the West Wing  is freaking out,  with advisers  on edge,   doing whatever they can not to be ensnared. One person close to Dina Powell and Gary Cohn said they re making sure to leave rooms if the subject of Russia comes up. Regarding Kushner, though, there is particular concern. Here s what Manafort s indictment tells me,  says former Trump campaign aide Sam Nunberg,  Mueller is going to go over every financial dealing of Jared Kushner and the Trump Organization.   Trump is at 33 percent in Gallup. You can t go any lower. He s f*cked,  he adds.Kushner s finances are already under scrutiny. Breitbart News  Adam Shaw reports:Kushner Companies has reportedly become a topic of interest for Mueller as he investigates alleged Russian interference, and the company was subpoenaed for its use of an immigration-for-investment scheme and for promoting the scheme to Chinese investors.Just this week, Maryland s attorney general announced an investigation into Kushner s family business  over allegations of abusive debt collection and disgusting living conditions at several properties,  reports Shaw.Kushner, who was tasked with a massive portfolio by Trump that includes solving America s opioid crisis, tackling criminal justice reform, and bringing peace to the Middle East   despite having no experience in any of these areas and achieving virtually no accomplishments in his time in the West Wing   is now reportedly shrinking his role, along with Ivanka, following their repeated terrible advice to the president and  periodic confusion and resentment  caused by their presence. Jared is the worst political adviser in the White House in modern history,  Nunberg tells Sherman.  I m only saying publicly what everyone says behind the scenes at Fox News, in conservative media, and the Senate and Congress. ",politics,"Nov 2, 2017"

She s trying to say that it s a forgone conclusion that Trump colluded with Russia. Clinton said the dossier was simply  opposition research  and pointed to the fact that it was not public knowledge during the election MORE BS! THE DOSSIER WAS PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE DURING THE ELECTION: The NYT even states that,  The document, a dossier prepared by a former British intelligence officer hired by Mr. Trump s political opponents, had been circulating among high-ranking politicians and some journalists since last fall. Mother Jones, a left-leaning publication, published an article in late October about the existence of the information. Newsweek also  published some of the allegations.It s what she doesn t say that s more important Tonight at 11/10c, Trevor and Hillary Clinton discuss the Steele dossier and Trump's ties to Russia. pic.twitter.com/dxJoAPTj8D  The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) November 1, 2017What she didn t talk about is the fact that this dossier is totally fabricated and was never confirmed to be true but they shopped it around to the media anyway! She funneled millions into the payment for this dossier instead of using it for  legal services . She faces an investigation from the Federal elections commission for misusing funds.Clinton said:  It was research that started by a Republican donor during the primary, and then when Trump got the nomination for the Republican Party, the people doing it came to my campaign lawyer and said,  would you like us to continue it? He said yes. He s an experienced lawyer, he knows what the law is, he knows what opposition research is.DIRTY DOSSIER:The dossier circulated in Washington last year and was turned over to the FBI for its review. It contends that Russia was engaged in a long-standing effort to aid Trump and had amassed compromising information about the Republican.Among its wild claims was that Russian officials have videos of the president cavorting with prostitutes, filmed during Trump s 2013 visit to a luxury Moscow hotel for the Miss Universe contest It also contains a highly unusual and unsubstantiated report that the call girls performed a  golden shower  routine that involved them urinating on a hotel bed as a sign of disgust for then-president Barack Obama.It is claimed that Barack Obama s campaign organization, Obama For America, paid Perkins Coie almost $1million to fund the research.

"JUST IN: Former DNC Chair Donna Brazile Accuses Hillary of CHEATING To Win Election, Laundering Money Through DNC&Drops Major BOMBSHELL About CANCER Barack Obama","After months of lying about passing debate questions to Hillary before the presidential debate that was hosted by her employer, CNN, the former DNC Chair Donna Brazile, finally came clean. During an interview with Trevor Noah of the Daily Show, Brazile arrogantly excused her dishonest behavior by telling Noah: Well, first of all, I didn t have my hands in the cookie jar. I m an operative, I m a strategist, and part of what my role was, in addition to being a  political pundit,  was to help advance the cause of justice and equality Today s a new day, however, and Donna Brazile has decided to emerge from the shadows to promote her new bombshell, tell-all book that is sure to ruffle a few feathers in the Democrat Party Her book is about the chaos at the DNC during the 2016 campaign. On Thursday, she revealed a section of it at Politico. What emerges from the excerpt is a picture of Brazile as a heroine (of course), Hillary Clinton as the villainess, Debbie Wasserman Schultz as incompetent and lazy, and Barack Obama as the unnamed cancer that ate away at the center of the party.Ouch.In Brazile s book, she claims that Obama cleaned out the Party. Brazile writes that by the time she took over, the Democratic Party was  broke and $2 million in debt.  According to Brazile, Obama  left the party $24 million in debt    hey, sort of like the country!   and his campaign wouldn t pay off that debt until election year. Furthermore, Wasserman Schultz had grown staff and allowed the DNC to pick up the check for Obama consultants.Brazile also claims that Hillary ran the Party. Hillary used that debt to pick up power   they pledged to fill in the funding gap for the DNC so long as they got to run operations. Gary Gensler, CFO of the Hillary campaign, apparently  described the party as fully under the control of Hillary s campaign, which seemed to confirm the suspicions of the Bernie camp. The campaign had the DNC on life support, giving it money every month to meet its basic expenses, while the campaign was using the party as a fund-raising clearinghouse. Hillary Essentially Laundered Campaign Money Through The DNC. Hillary raised an enormous amount of money for the DNC, but virtually all that money went to Hillary s campaign. Less than half of 1 percent of all money Hillary raised from her fundraisers went to the states. Brazile explains:When the Politico story described this arrangement as  essentially   money laundering  for the Clinton campaign, Hillary s people were outraged at being accused of doing something shady. Bernie s people were angry for their own reasons, saying this was part of a calculated strategy to throw the nomination to Hillary.The party ran as an adjunct to the Hillary campaign long before the primaries, meaning that Bernie was at a severe disadvantage. Brazile admits as much:The funding arrangement with HFA and the victory fund agreement was not illegal, but it sure looked unethical. If the fight had been fair, one campaign would not have control of the party before the voters had decided which one they wanted to lead.For entire story: Daily Wire ",politics,"Nov 2, 2017"
"FORMER NPR CEO DITCHES AND SWITCHES: How A Liberal Learned to Love the Right [Video]","The former NPR CEO Ken Stern ditches and switches after getting out of the Liberal Bubble He recently spoke with Tucker Carlson about his escape from the  liberal bubble . We give him huge credit for ditching the left to come over to the RIGHT side:STERN RECENTLY SPOKE WITH BREITBART S ALEX MARLOW:Stern described himself as a  lifelong Democrat  who  spent time in Democratic politics, ran NPR,  and  lived in a 93 percent Democratic ward in a 100 percent Democratic household.  Concern for the increasing political polarization of the country led him on a journey into red-state America to take a clear look at the other side of the political divide.He said his  a-ha!  moment was the latest version of a pledge recited annually by children at a block party in his D.C. neighborhood:  All are welcome here on Hobart Street, man or woman, gay or straight, white or black   everyone but Republicans. It was a joke, but it wasn t a joke,  he said.  It really signified, I think, how people are starting to feel about side. For me it said, you know what, something s got to change, at least for me. I live in a Democratic bubble. I need to get out there and meet the other half of America and see if they are  deplorables,  or if they are Americans like me. That s really what this year is about. Stern said NPR is  different from other media organizations  because its staff lives across the entire country, rather than being concentrated in a few media and political hubs. The New York Times, based in New York, 90 percent of their staff will be in New York. NPR is actually a membership organization with stations across the country. So it is actually unusual in the sense that it does have representation across the country,  he explained. I think the challenge, and I sort of challenged this week in the New York Post, is that even though they are geographically distributed, they   like most mainstream journalist organizations   draw from a pool of largely liberal people,  he continued.  When that happens you risk groupthink, you risk thinking about what stories are important that really don t represent the rest of the country as a whole. Stern contended that  bubbling  has become a bipartisan phenomenon,  because we are so politically vulcanized   Democrats hang out with Democrats, Republicans hang out with Republicans   it is easy to engage in the most vicious stick-figure cartoonish depiction of the other side. The Washington Post did a poll last year, I think, where they asked Democrats,  give me one word to describe Republicans,  and they did the same for Republicans. The words that came out from both sides were ridiculous. I mean, if you re a Republican you re a  bigot,  if you re a Democrat you re a  traitor.  I forget the exact words, but all of the words that came out were really cartoons of the other side,  he recalled. I think when Hillary Clinton said that she thought half the people that supported Trump were from the  basket of deplorables,  and then apologized for it, I think it does reflect how many people think about conservatives,  he said.  Truthfully, I think it goes both ways. That s a shame because we don t know the other side. Stern s journey to the flip side of politics took him  pig hunting in Texas  and  going to small Assembly of God churches  to meet people with different viewpoints. It meant hanging out in Pikeville, Kentucky, sort of a declining coal mining community. It meant going to Youngstown, Ohio. It meant tons of things,  he said.  The subtitle of the book is  How I Left the Liberal Bubble and Learned to Love the Right.  It didn t mean that I agreed with everyone I met, but it meant I met hundreds of people who I admired, and were doing great things in their community, and who in no way reflected the cartoon figure of what Middle America looks like. Stern said he took issues he was positive he was right about   including  climate change, poverty programs, and guns    and challenged himself by talking with people like gun-control skeptic John Lott. Jr. I went hunting. I went to gun shows. I talked to experts. I did my own research. And I really came away with a very different perspective, because I tried to look at it from other people s points of view. When you do that, you re going to change,  he said.He recalled pig hunting in George as an especially memorable experience for someone from an urban gun-control political environment, as he was tutored in gun safety by an eight-year-old, and found himself hunting with a diverse group that bore little resemblance to coastal caricatures of rural white men. I m an agnostic Jew from Washington, DC. I don t have a lot of experiences with evangelicals, so what I knew was from  Footloose  and from Jerry Falwell, who had been dead for ten years by the time I did this,  Stern said of his foray into church life, culminating in a visit to the Urbana Conference with some 15,000 evangelical youths. I thought they would be like you see in the movies. But these kids were there, they were talking about refugees   how to help them, not how to turn them away. They were talking about diversity on campus. They were talking about how to dedicate their lives to feeding the poor and housing the homeless. It was a really admirable group of people I saw. It taught me that, look, there are 50 million evangelicals, which means there are 50 million stories. You just can t bucket everyone in simple ways,  he said.Stern said that media people tend to  cluster in groups and reinforce their own stereotypes, their own confirmation bias, their own groupthink. That s a challenge that s really hard to acknowledge, but hard to deal with. And that s, I think, a fundamental challenge for the CNNs and others of the world,  he said.  But I think in the age of Trump they ve also found, if we can be direct about it, conflict is good for business. President Trump   it s actually sort of a self-reinforcing circle   challenges the  failing New York Times  and the New York Times responds, and it s great for business for both of them. And that s a problem. ",politics,"Nov 2, 2017"

She s one tough cookie!Pamela Geller: He hates me more than the terrorists so I can t take much of what he says seriously.Fox is imploding right now. Pam Geller is attacking Geraldo Rivera for saying he needs to take a shower after she appears on the network.   pic.twitter.com/tYTvvSX5z8  Thomas Bishop (@bishopk0s) November 2, 2017Remember that Geraldo insulted Geller when she was almost killed by two jihadists in Texas Geller has long been a target of radical Islamists. Her life has been threatened but she keeps up the fight:Pam Geller has been spot on when speaking about the truth of jihadists. She spoke with The Hollywood Reporter about how she feels Hollywood is  in the pocket  of jihadis. Very interesting read and lots to learn from this very brave lady:Pamela Geller has been on a rampage against radical Islam for years, beginning notably in 2010 by spearheading of the opposition to what she called the  Ground Zero Mega Mosque  near the site of the destroyed World Trade Center. Her most recent controversy was the organization of a  Draw the Prophet Muhammad  contest in Texas.At the event, two self-described jihadists shot a security guard before police killed them. Then, on June 2, police killed a knife-wielding Muslim man in Boston whose goal was allegedly to behead Geller in retaliation for the contest. Even though the contest was a major news story, few media outlets published the winning cartoon. Geller s group, American Freedom Defense Initiative, put the image on billboards, 100 of which debuted in St. Louis on Monday with the tagline  Support Free Speech.  She spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about how the (largely hostile) media is portraying these events.Why are you being overly provocative, purposely insulting Muslims?I am not being overly provocative or purposely insulting Muslims. Islamic jihadists, not I, made Muhammad cartoons the flash point for the defense of the freedom of speech when they began killing over them. If we don t stand against them on that point, the only alternative is surrender and submission. I did not make the cartoons a flash point, the jihadis did.But if you just don t insult their prophet, they ll leave you alone, no?No. The death penalty for insulting Muhammad is just one aspect of Sharia. There is much, much more of infidel behavior that violates Sharia. If we refrain from drawing Muhammad, more demands to adhere to other aspects of Sharia will follow. Millions are suffering or have been slaughtered under Islamic Sharia law in Muslim countries. Islamic supremacists mean to impose it in the West.There is no hate speech exception to the First Amendment.  Hate speech  is a subjective judgment. If it were outlawed, the authority with the power to decide what constitutes it would have the power to control the public debate.  If a group will not bear being offended without resorting to violence, that group will rule unopposed while everyone else lives in fear, while other groups curtail their activities to appease the violent group. This results in the violent group being able to tyrannize the others. Cartoons have been used as satire since the beginning of satire   especially in our country   and no one gets a pass. Not the Pope of Rome, president of the United States or Hollywood s biggest movie stars.  If you don t like it, don t look at it, boycott the network that airs it, don t buy the publication, make counter-images, make a million, fine, but you have to adjust to us, not we to you, and if that s too much, don t come here. Threaten violence? Commit violence? The consequences are yours to bear.It seems many media pundits who claim allegiance to the First Amendment aren t persuaded by your arguments.They are afraid of being killed by Islamic jihadists and camouflage their fear and cowardice as  respect  for Islam and Muslims.Are there any TV hosts who have been particularly hostile to you during interviews?Yes. Martha MacCallum, Erin Burnett, Alisyn Camerota, Chris Cuomo   although he let me speak and make my case.How about behind your back?Yes. Bill O Reilly and Laura Ingraham. They said I was insulting the entire religion, one held by our moderate allies such as Egypt and Qatar. They are wrong in assuming that we must submit to Sharia to placate moderates, rather than that moderates need to accept the freedom of speech. Roman Catholics don t like their religion mocked or the mockery of other religions, but Roman Catholics don t kill when their religion is mocked   and so no one talks about  provoking  them or  respecting  them. In any pluralistic society, we have to put up with being offended and even with our core beliefs being mocked. Roman Catholics have learned that. Mormons and others have learned that   look at The Book of Mormon on Broadway. Why must we condescend to Muslims and think they cannot learn that? It s the low expectation of soft bigotry.So this isn t entirely a partisan issue where conservatives stand by you and liberals don t?No. Chris Hayes stuck up for me on MSNBC. This is not a left/right split, it is a free person/slave split.Did any TV host say something that struck you as particularly wrongheaded?They all say I have the right to draw Muhammad but shouldn t out of respect. They don t seem to realize that any surrender on this point will only be seen by the jihadists as a victory and embolden them to make more demands. CNN s Erin Burnett said I relished being the target of a beheading. It s madness. Who self-promotes to get killed?So you re not purposely courting danger, as Burnett and others have insinuated?Of course not. I love life. But I will not live as a slave.Are there any TV hosts you d like to face off with but who won t have you on?Bill O Reilly. I expect he knows he would be shown up.We know about the man arrested who intended to behead you. Any other threats you can share?I have received many threats. The FBI and NYPD are aware of them and on the case.Anyone in Hollywood reach out to you to offer support?No.Should Hollywood care about threats against you?They may think they re exempt, but they aren t. Islamic supremacists will be demanding they adhere to Sharia as well. Of course, most producers already are careful not to show anything that might offend Muslims, including accurate representations of jihad plotting and activity, so Hollywood is mostly already in their pocket. But this is their issue, and the entertainment industry should be on the front lines in the information battle space. The jihadists aren t just coming for me, they are coming for all of us that believe in freedom.So why do you think Hollywood, which routinely claims to push the envelope in its art, hasn t supported you?They re afraid of being ostracized.Your  Draw Muhammad  event certainly got a lot of news coverage. Should mainstream media outlets have published the winning cartoon?Every media outlet should publish the Muhammad cartoons. They can t kill us all. By kowtowing to violent intimidation, they are inviting more of it. Instead, they should be showing that we will all stand together for free speech. If the media had published the Danish cartoons back in 2005, this would never have become an issue. The submission by media, entertainment and academic elites empowered the savages.The Southern Poverty Law Center included you on their list of  hate groups.  Are they right?Of course not. They re the hate group, using that label to demonize and stigmatize all who don t share their hard-left agenda. The SPLC smear machine does not profile jihad groups, but they target and libel patriots, veterans, Tea Party organizations and other groups that work in defense of freedom. They named [Republican presidential contender] Ben Carson as a hate group. That should tell you everything you need to know about them. Their [sympathizers] have violently attacked family groups, and one tried to assassinate Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council.

Yesterday, it was discovered that the Islamic extremist who killed 9 people and injured dozens of others, when he rammed his truck into them on a busy bike path in New York City, entered our country on a  Diversity visa  that was the brainchild of none other than the Democrat Senator from NY, Chuck (I always put diversity before our nation s security) Schumer An Indian athlete who overcame a visa denial with the help of U.S. lawmakers and a local mayor to attend the World Snowshoe Championship in New York has been arrested on charges of the abuse of a minor.It was a long journey for Indian snowshoe champion Hussain and his coach to the World Snowshoe Championships in Saranac Lake, New York last weekend.The pair were initially denied visas to travel to the U.S. in the chaotic days following the Trump administration s travel ban, but with the help of Saranac s mayor and   according to Mir   the office of Democratic Sen. Chuck Schemer, the American Embassy in New Delhi reversed their decision Feb. 17 and allowed them to travel to the competition.Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer, an outspoken opponent of President Trump s attempts to more carefully vet refugees and visa holder s coming into the United States, bragged about getting around Trump s temporary travel restrictions on his Facebook page:Hussain hails from the Indian side of the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, which is predominantly Muslim. Although India is not one of the seven countries that were part of the initial travel ban, Hussain and Khan had alleged they were victims of it when their first attempt at procuring visas to travel to the United States was turned down in late January, the first business day after Trump s travel ban was put in place.Khan told the BBC that an employee at the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi told them they were being rejected because of  current policy. U.S. officials said at the time that the denial was not connected to the travel ban. An embassy spokesman said they were preparing a statement for release later in the day.  National PostThe reckless and irresponsible acts of Democrat legislators like Senator Chuck Schumer, perfectly illustrates why Trump was right about demanding that we put additional vetting measures in place for immigrants. Hussain and team manager Abid Khan arrived Feb. 23 in the bucolic Adirondacks town, which had been following their visa ordeal and extended them a hero s welcome. Locals offered congratulations and free lodgings at an inn that in the snow looked like a  fairy tale scene from a movie,  Khan said in a Facebook post.The  fairy tale  was shattered Wednesday, when Hussain, 24, was arrested and charged with felony sexual abuse and child welfare endangerment, police said.The parents of the 12-year-old girl allegedly involved said the incident happened Monday, after the end of the three-day snowshoe competition, and reported it to local authorities.Chief Charles A. Potthast Jr. of the Saranac Lake Village police force said the girl was playing pool Monday afternoon with other young people at the inn where Hussain was staying. There was a moment when the two were alone, and that s when the incident occurred,  Potthast said. The girl told police there was a  passionate kiss  and that Hussain touched her in an intimate area on top of her clothing.Hussain remains jailed on $10,000 bond. Khan said the athlete told him he had done nothing wrong.A spokesman for Schumer said the senator helped with the visa process at the request of Saranac Lake and described the charges against Hussain as  extremely troubling. A spokesman for Gillibrand said the senator thinks the charges are  extremely serious. During their time in Saranac Lake, Hussein and his coach were honored with a special reception by the mayor and gave a talk about Kashmir at Saranac Lake Middle School, where students had waged a letter-writing campaign on their behalf.  Pack your bags. Next year you are coming to Kashmir,  Hussain told them, according to one of Khan s Facebook posts. Washington PostThe athlete s coach said he is innocent. Mir had said that the visa would not have been issued without the  personal efforts  of Schumer and New York s other Democratic senator, Kirsten Gillibrand. On Saturday, Schumer celebrated Hussain s  rock star  welcome in a Facebook post, saying that the United States is  still a country that welcome athletes from across the globe to compete in our stadiums, our snow-covered fields and everywhere in between.

"WATCH: How The Crooked Clinton Foundation HID Over $145 Million In Donations From URANIUM ONE Shareholders","While the mainstream media was salivating over the indictment of Paul Manafort by dirty cop Robert Mueller, for crimes he allegedly committed years before he worked on Trump s campaign, a bombshell was being dropped by the author of  Clinton Cash , Peter Schweitzer about Hillary Clinton and how her dirty dealings while acting as Obama s Secretary of State have compromised our national security.Watch:Hillary's Clinton Foundation took in 145 MILLION frm 9 different Share holders frm Russian Uranium Co. and did NOT report it. Podesta  pic.twitter.com/rsp09SPylt   STOCK MONSTER  (@StockMonsterUSA) October 19, 2017The National Review recently published a great article explaining how the Clinton crime family laundered money through their crooked foundation while putting our national security at risk: The FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion, and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin s atomic energy business inside the United States,  The Hill s John Solomon and Alison Spann report. They add that an eyewitness, with corroborating documents, indicates that, starting in 2009,  Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow. Even after this skullduggery was discovered, the federal Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States   on which Hillary sat   decided that Rosatom, the Russian government s atomic-energy company, could capture 20 percent of America s uranium supply, by purchasing a mining company called Uranium One. Rosatom announced its acquisition plans on June 8, 2010. While Hillary weighed this deal, Bill scored $500,000 for his address that June 29 to Renaissance Capital, a Kremlin-tied bank that endorsed Rosatom s move. Before, during, and after CFIUS s deliberations, nine Uranium One investors gave the Clinton Foundation some $145 million. Ultimately, CFIUS approved the Kremlin s transaction, on October 23, 2010.Even worse, despite lacking an export license, Uranium One reportedly shipped uranium out of America. Destination: Unknown. Remember: Uranium is a main ingredient in atomic bombs. Why would the Obama-Clinton administration let Russia have even a firecracker s worth of American uranium? This is the $145 million question.  I was unaware of this criminal probe concerning bribery,  says Peter Schweizer, who first uncovered Uranium One in Clinton Cash, his best-seller on America s most powerful crime family.For entire story: National Review ",politics,"Nov 1, 2017"
"LAWYER FOR FBI INFORMANT Knows of Russian Bribery and Info That Involves the Clintons [Video]","DC lawyer Victoria Toensing is one smart cookie. She s representing a former FBI informant who has evidence on kickbacks and bribery involving the transportation of uranium in the US. She recently told Sean Hannity her client will brief Congress about Russian involvement in the U.S. uranium market. This includes widespread bribery and actions that involved the Clintons I m not going into detail,  attorney Victoria Toensing said on the Oct. 24 Hannity.  You know that, Sean. But the informant will give an overview and specific conversations that he had with Russians in what they were thinking about the money that they were spending. I mean, let me just be that general and it involves the Clintons. The director of the FBI at that time was Robert Mueller, and he is now the special counsel investigating alleged Russian collusion with the 2016 Trump campaign. The undercover investigation involving Toensing s client occurred between 2009 and 2014, and the senior attorney on the case was Rod Rosenstein, who is now the deputy attorney general of the United States and the official who appointed Mueller as special counsel.Further, all this information indicates that many senior Obama administration officials knew about instances of bribery and money laundering involving at least one Russian official, at a time when Russia wanted to expand its uranium market in the United States, and when the administration through a special committee had to approve or deny the sale of a company, Vancouver-based Uranium One, to Rosatom. (Rosatom is the Russian State Atomic Energy Corporation.)Some of the people on that Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States included then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Attorney General Eric Holder, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napalitano, and Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner.The committee approved the sale of Uranium One to Rosatom in October 2010. That sale gave Russia, and President Vladimir Putin, control over 20% of U.S. uranium production. (At least nine investors in Uranium One   prior to, during, and after that sale   donated $145 million to the Clinton Foundation.) So, Mueller, [Rod] Rosenstein, maybe even [James] Comey at the time, and the president of the United States   certainly Eric Holder was the head of the DOJ   they all knew that they had all this evidence that the Russians had infiltrated with the purpose of a criminal enterprise to corner the market on uranium, the foundational material of nuclear weapons?  asked Hannity.Toensing said,  That is correct.

"WOW! POPULAR IMAM WARNED NYC Mayor DeBlasio Of Terror Threats: De Blasio spent all his energy and resources in trying to bring down President Trump and not Islamic Extremists","Imam Tawhidi is an outspoken voice in the Muslim community, who is unafraid to openly condemn Islamic extremists. After the terror attack today on the streets of New York City by a radical Muslim who was allegedly here on a  diversity visa , Imam Tawidi took off the gloves on Twitter and told the world that he warned Mayor DeBlasio, but was  Ignored! Tawhidi regularly tweets about the evils of extreme Islam:Extremists cannot force us into their paradise. In fact, I don t want to be in paradise if they re going to be there as well.  Imam Tawhidi (@Imamofpeace) October 31, 2017The Australian Imam is young, well presented and articulate. He is charming, has successfully utilized social media and has a strong following amongst the Australian public. Perhaps most importantly to a government that yearns for unity amongst its electorate, Tawhidi is an immigrant who champions the integration of fellow expats into the Australian community. The complete package, as it were.He isn t shy about calling out Islamic extremists and the people who suffer under Islamic extremist rule. Yesterday, Imam Tawhidi tweeted about his friend who was beaten to death by the Basij Militia of Iran over his anti-terrorist views:My friend Ali Yazdanshenas has passed away yesterday after being beaten to death by the Basij militia of Iran for his anti-terrorist views. pic.twitter.com/E04FJFcPyX  Imam Tawhidi (@Imamofpeace) October 30, 2017However, there is a barrier preventing Australian elites from supporting this maverick cleric, and that is that he does not follow the liberal narrative. Instead of simply condemning obscene teachings associated with his religion, Tawhidi demands modification. Rather than apologize for shortcomings within the immigrant community, the Imam has called for immediate action, encouraging a ban on Islamic schools and Islamist organizations like Hizb ut Tahrir. Through this, Tawhidi has even received the endorsement of none other than Ayaan Hirsi Ali   perhaps the most famous anti-Islamist (and Islamic) activist in the world   who has suggested that Tawhidi should be  elevated  to sit amongst and give counsel to politicians and leaders.Tawhidi is, therefore, one of those rare public figures: a reformer who not only denounces elements of Islam but actually seeks to restructure its teachings and interpretations. However, in the current global environment, the courage to promote such ideas inevitably leads to danger; the threat of violence is so present that Tawhidi has been forced to implement constant security measures in both his professional and private life.  The Spectator One might believe that a courageous person like Imam Tawhidi would be a valuable ally to America in their efforts to defeat radical Islam in the United States.  Based on the Imam s tweets, following the terror attack by a  diversity visa  holder in NYC, it appears that Mayor DeBlasio didn t find his warnings to be useful.Imam Tawhidi claims he personally sent letters to Mayor DeBlasio, and that he  did nothing. About #NYC terrorist attack, I personally sent letters to Mayor De Blasio online & in person about terrorist breeding in NYC.He did nothing.  Imam Tawhidi (@Imamofpeace) October 31, 2017Tawidi then tweeted that after warning DeBlasio about  hot radical centers  in NYC, he was  Ignored! In 2016, I told Mayor De Blasio that I was in NYC and noticed some hot radical centres. I was willing to point out serious cases. Ignored!  Imam Tawhidi (@Imamofpeace) October 31, 2017Imam Tawhidi explained that he s not some crackpot Imam trying to get attention, he actually holds a certificate in counter-terrorism.Not only am I a Muslim Imam who understands the threat of Islamic Extremism, I also hold a certificate in counter-terrorism. Now what!?  Imam Tawhidi (@Imamofpeace) October 31, 2017Tawhidi really blasted DeBlasio and all of the wasted energy he expends on trying to bring down President Trump and not Islamic Extremists.Fact: In the last two years, De Blasio spent all his energy and resources in trying to bring down President Trump and not Islamic Extremists  Imam Tawhidi (@Imamofpeace) October 31, 2017Imam Tawhidi went on to slam the Mayor DeBlasio of NYC and Mayor Sadiq Kahn of London who offered NYC his condolences after the terror attack:London stands in grief and solidarity with the great city of New York tonight. pic.twitter.com/ojrxSDnZos  Sadiq Khan (@SadiqKhan) October 31, 2017Here is Tawhidi s reply:De Blasio griefs about London and you grief about NYC. How about you both swap positions since you don t really care about your own people!? https://t.co/0yqTprAbdw  Imam Tawhidi (@Imamofpeace) October 31, 2017Spectator   It was during this overseas study, in 2014, that Tawhidi saw it as his duty to speak out against the questionable elements enshrined in his religion. On a sunny day in the Iraqi city of Karbala, Tawhidi was standing outside a mosque when, within earshot, a bomb exploded. As crowds ran from the scene and emergency crews rushed to help the survivors, the speakers of the mosque announced to the street below that Islamic State forces had invaded Mosul. If ever there was a time to speak out against Islamist terrorism, it was then.However, Tawhidi s campaigning has attracted many critics within the Islamic community itself. Calling for the closure of Islamic schools is bound to court controversy, but it is his contention that Islamic teachings are the causal link to Islamist terrorist acts that seems to really rile community leaders. Following the Manchester bombing, Tawhidi appeared in a fiery TV exchange with Dr. Jamal Rifi, imploring his fellow guest to acknowledge that the Islamic holy scripture  teach(es) the beheading of people .Perhaps Tawhidi is just the kind of person America, and the know-it-all liberals in European nations, who are being overrun by Islamic extremists posing as immigrants, need to be listening to, and perhaps next time, they might want to consider taking his warnings seriously ",politics,"Oct 31, 2017"
"JUST IN: NYC TERRORIST Allegedly Entered U.S. On NY Democrat Senator Chuck Schumers DIVERSITY VISA Program","Mark Levin dropped a bombshell on his show tonight about the Muslim terrorist who killed 9 people in Manhattan and injured dozens.  The Diversity VISA program was given the green light by none other than New York Democrat Senator Chuck Schumer... Mark Levin; NYC muslim terrorist came to US under  Diversity VISA Program    a bizarre lottery to shove more foreigners down our throats  Deplorable MD   (@MDDeplorable) October 31, 2017According to ABC 7:Authorities say he came to the United States seven years ago from Uzbekistan under what is called the Diversity Visa Program, which offers a lottery for people from countries with few immigrants in America.DIVERSITY LOTTERYOn May 1, 2017, the Washington Post wrote an article designed to criticize President Trump, as millions were concerned that this could be the last year of the  Diversity Lottery .According to the Washington Post, the lottery s premise is simple. Each year, the Diversity Visa Lottery, as it is officially known, provides up to 50,000 randomly selected foreigners   fewer than 1 percent of those who enter the drawing   with permanent residency in the United States.It s not connected to employment or family members in the United States. The only requirement is that entrants be adults with a high school diploma or two years of work experience. Winners can bring spouses and children. Citizens of countries that have sent 50,000 people to the United States in the past five years   such as Canada, China, India, Nigeria and Mexico   are ineligible to participate.The current lottery coincides with an intense debate over immigration and comes amid policy changes that have made the country less welcoming to new arrivals. President Trump has cracked down on illegal immigration and pressed forward with plans to build a wall along the border with Mexico. He has issued executive orders targeting foreign workers, refugees and travelers from certain majority-Muslim countries.But he hasn t said a word about the green-card lottery.Its days may be numbered, nonetheless. The lottery appears to conflict with the president s call for a  merit-based  immigration system. And at least two bills in the Republican-controlled Congress seek to eliminate the program. The Diversity Lottery is plagued with fraud, advances no economic or humanitarian interest, and does not even deliver the diversity of its namesake,  according to a news release from Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.), a co-sponsor of one of the bills.The program   operated from a consular center in Williamsburg, Ky.   has been on the chopping block before. It came under attack in 2002 after an Egyptian terrorist who killed two people in Los Angeles was found to be in the United States through his wife s diversity visa. Mohamed Atta, another Egyptian and one of the 9/11 suicide pilots, had entered the lottery twice before entering the United States on a different visa to study aviation. If you re a terrorist organization and you can get a few hundred people to apply to this from several countries . . . odds are you d get one or two of them picked,  Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.) told The Washington Post in 2011 after introducing an ill-fated bill to kill the program.State Department officials insist that lottery winners are vetted just as thoroughly as other potential immigrants to the United States.Here s how the  Diversity  Immigrant VISA program works:Twitter responded to the idiocy of the  diversity  visa program:Muslim terrorist slaughters 8 in NYC today.

He s also been unable to get much traction on his plans to overhaul a beleaguered flood insurance program. I HAVE ALREADY STAYED FAR LONGER THAN I HAD ORIGINALLY PLANNED Today I am announcing that I will not seek reelection to the US Congress in 2018.

The bill cleared the committee with Republican votes in 2013, but failed to advance in the House thanks to finance industry skepticism.Notably, it would have dissolved the bailed-out mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In their stead, it would have created a privately-run utility to facilitate the creation of mortgage-backed securities and support a secondary market for home loans.The bill would have removed government backing for mortgage-backed utilities, though. At the time, many industry groups, including the Mortgage Bankers Association, argued eliminating the government backstop for mortgage-backed securities would make 30-year fixed-rate loans unavailable.READ MORE: DALLAS NEWS",politics,"Oct 31, 2017"

It s hard to say if the whole security guard entrance was a set-up for comedic purposes, but in any event, Kimmel did make the point that he was standing up for Ivanka, and refused to sit back and watch Andy Dick make uncomfortable and unwanted advances on her.Watch:Kimmel was, of course, quick to defend Trump s daughter on his show. But that was during the pre-Obama era of 2007 when Jimmy Kimmel and all of Hollywood loved Donald Trump. Who could ve possibly imagined that only 9 years later, Trump would betray the liberal Democrat cesspool of Hollywood, and put his passion for defending the forgotten man, or the everyday American before the false idols of liberal Hollywood?As Hollywood continues its implosion  it looks like Andy Dick s chickens are finally coming home to roost.Hollywood Reporter   Though the 51-year-old actor denies he groped anyone, he does admit to other inappropriate behavior:  I might have kissed somebody on the cheek to say goodbye and then licked them. That s my thing.  Andy Dick has been dropped from the independent feature film Raising Buchanan following accusations of sexual harassment and misconduct on set.The Hollywood Reporter was not able to reach any of the alleged victims, however, two sources detailed Dick s inappropriate behavior, which included groping people s genitals, unwanted kissing/licking and sexual propositions of at least four members of the production. It s unclear if those involved were actors or crew.Late Monday, THR spoke to Dick, who confirmed he was let go from his small role in the film. Though he vehemently denied groping claims, he said it s possible that he licked people and he confirmed that he did make advances on others.To anyone who has followed Dick s legal troubles, his well-documented history of outlandish comedy and often intentionally offensive behavior, his dismissal may not come as a surprise. But the claims can be seen as more unsettling in today s cultural climate in the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal. (Or ousted figures like Bill O Reilly, Amazon Studios  Roy Price, political journalist Mark Halperin, The Loud House creator Chris Savino, and the list goes on.)Dick said he s aware of his reputation. At first, he made light of the situation, joking that  my middle name is  misconduct.  They know what they signed up for.  However, he followed up with a denial that he ever groped anyone on set. I don t grope people anymore. I don t expose myself anymore,  he said by telephone. (Also well-documented is his history of exposing his genitals in public and on stage.)  I do understand that the temperature in the world right now is delicate. Kimmel recently claimed that he would  go easy  on the accused rapist and serial sexual predator Hollywood kingpin Harvey Weinstein while hosting the Academy Awards show in 2018. FOX News   Jimmy Kimmel intends to deliver some sly wisecracks about disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein when he hosts next year s Oscars   but he ll tread warily given that victims of the accused sexual predator may be vying for the gold-plated awards. It s not really a laughing matter,  the  Jimmy Kimmel Live!  host says about the rape and sexual assault allegations pouring out against Weinstein in New York magazine out Monday.Hollywood.com caught up with Kimmel after Dick was dragged off the stage by security with Kimmel s assistance. Here s what Kimmel had to say:Talk-show host Jimmy Kimmel has spoken out about his decision to carry unruly guest Andy Dick off his show on Friday night, confessing the wacky funnyman always makes him  uncomfortable. Kimmel called security and helped them physically remove Dick from his show sofa after the comic started making unwanted advances toward fellow guest Ivanka Trump.The host says,  Andy did a segment, he was a little out of it. (When) she (Ivanka) came out, he wanted a big, wet kiss. It was time for Andy to go, so I escorted him out by his feet. But Kimmel has spoken to Dick since the Jimmy Kimmel Live incident, and he insists the comic is far from upset about his rude exit.Kimmel adds,  He s Andy. He s not upset. He s not apologetic. He s just nutty. ",politics,"Oct 31, 2017"
"WHY PAUL MANAFORT Indictment Is Bad News For Dirty Cop Robert Mueller","This summarization by Peter Flaherty, President of the National Legal and Policy Center, of why the indictment of Paul Manafort actually exposes the truth about the dirty dealings of special prosecutor Robert Mueller, is brilliant and is a must-read for anyone who cares to see what s really going on behind the curtain.Daily Caller   More than anything else, the indictments of Paul Manafort and his partner Rick Gates demonstrate the fraudulent nature of Special Counsel Robert Mueller s investigation. The probe has little to do with Russian interference in last year s election. Instead, it is calculated to protect Mueller and a cabal within the FBI and Justice Department who covered up crimes by Hillary Clinton because they believed it was likely that she would be elected president.And once Mueller and then his friend and successor James Comey covered for Hillary, they had to keep covering. There was a reason that Mueller was so available when he was so swiftly appointed Special Counsel in May by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. The Comey firing threatened to expose all that these same officials had swept under the rug. Yes, Rosenstein bit the bullet and drafted the memo that was the legal basis for firing Comey, but it would be followed by appointing Mueller.In July, Comey preemptively exonerated Hillary despite her maintenance of a private email server and mishandling of classified material. By accusing her of being  extremely careless,  he purposely distracted attention from the context of the emails. Hillary and Bill Clinton operated an aggressive shakedown operation of domestic and foreign interests, many of which are unsavory and criminal. Concealing the true nature of the operation was at least part of the Clintons  motivation for the private server.The outlines of the Uranium One deal were not a secret. Media outlets like the New York Times reported on the U.S. government approval of a partial sale of the Canadian mining company to Rosatom, a Russian firm, while those who benefitted donated to the Clinton Foundation and paid Bill Clinton $500,000 for a single speech in Moscow.Then came more detailed reports about how the FBI cracked the case of a major Russian effort to penetrate the North American uranium industry through a host of illegal activities, but somehow the whole matter was slow-walked and kept from U.S. government officials who had to approve the Uranium One deal. Mueller and Comey ultimately supervised the probe.Meanwhile, the FBI s email investigation was supervised by now-FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who has significant connections to the Clintons through his wife Jill McCabe. Hillary headlined a fundraiser for a group supporting Jill McCabe s campaign for the Virginia state senate, as first reported in the Wall Street Journal. The National Legal and Policy Center subsequently exposed more Clintonista support, including from then-Clinton Foundation operative Doug Band who wrote a personal check for $50,000.The plot thickened last week when the bombshell hit that it was Hillary s campaign and the Democratic National Committee that paid for the Fusion GPS dossier. Reporters were chagrined to realize that they had been lied to repeatedly for months and months. Hillary now claims that the first she heard of it was when the dossier memo was printed by BuzzFeed in January, a likely lie. As long as this  what did Hillary know and when did Hillary know it  question is of no interest to Mueller, his investigation has no credibility whatsoever. But therein lies the dilemma for Mueller. A real probe of Hillary would mean a review of his own actions and those of his colleagues. He s cornered.Mueller s strategy is clear. He has to rescue himself, Comey, McCabe, Rosenstein and others from their complicity in Hillary s dealings with the Russians. Mueller is creating a diversion by going after Manafort, the lowest of low-hanging fruit. Just about any inquiry into Manafort s dealings over the years was sure to yield results.The left and the leftist media are apoplectic over the possibility that they finally have Trump in their crosshairs. The problem is after the media smoke has cleared, the truth is revealed about the Manafort indictment, and the facts point to President Trump having nothing to do with it. Democrats would love nothing more than to see President Trump fire special prosecutor Robert Mueller, as it would prove that he was guilty of the Trump-Russian narrative the Democrats and their allies in the media have been pushing since the night he soundly defeated Hillary Clinton in the election upset of the century. Watch Jay Sekulow explain to rabid CNN host Wolf Blitzer that Trump has nothing to do with either the announcement of the  indictments of Paul Manafort or campaign volunteer George Papadopoulos: ",politics,"Oct 31, 2017"

"FORMER SPEAKER JOHN BOEHNER Goes Low&Calls Two Republicans Aholes","What s gotten into John Boehner? He gave a strange interview to left-leaning Politico and unloaded on former colleagues. During the interview he claimed he held no grudges against his former colleagues yet he called a few of them  a holes . Was he drunk? He also got into it on twitter with Sean Hannity and Hannity shot back questioning whether Boehner had been drinking Perhaps Hannity is on to something.John were you sober when you said this? That conversation never happened.

He went really crazy right and got a big audience, and he dragged Hannity to the dark side. He dragged Rush to the dark side. And these guys   I used to talk to them all the time. And suddenly they re beating the living s  out of me. TRUE COLORS?Why is John Boehner suddenly attacking his fellow Republicans? Jordan is a valued member of Congress and isn t a RINO so maybe Boehner has it out for him.Former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said in a new profile from Politico on Sunday that Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and former Rep. Jason Chaffetz(R-Utah) are  a holes. The former speaker made the comment while discussing Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) likely becoming the chair of the House Oversight Committee, a position Gowdy eventually earned.Chaffetz, the previous chair, had recently announced his resignation from Congress at the time of the interview. Jordan, who was also on the committee, was reportedly considering going out for the chairmanship. Gowdy   that s my guy, even though he doesn t know how to dress,  John Boehner told Politico.  F  Jordan. F  Chaffetz. They re both a holes. Boehner also called Chaffetz a  total phony  who was obsessed with promoting himself while in Congress. With Chaffetz it s always about Chaffetz,  Boehner told Politico.Chaffetz resigned from Congress in June and joined Fox News as a contributor.Boehner also criticized Jordan, who helped found the House s Freedom Caucus, which was part of the movement to push Boehner out as speaker: Jordan was a terrorist as a legislator going back to his days in the Ohio House and Senate,  Boehner told Politico.  A terrorist. A legislative terrorist. Last July, Boehner also spoke out against Jordan:Former House Speaker John Boehner assailed GOP House arch conservatives led by Rep. Jim Jordan as the  knucklehead caucus,  calling them  anarchists  who are  for nothing. In a speech from a private gathering in Las Vegas casino/resort, the West Chester Republican took aim at the conservatives who pushed him from office at the end of 2015. Among those was Jordan, R-Urbana, who revolted against Boehner, even though he was the first speaker from Ohio since Republican Nicholas Longworth in 1931.Boehner was asked to explain why House Republicans did not support House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., to succeed Boehner as speaker. The knucklehead caucus decided they weren t going to vote for him,  Boehner said.  Now these are the guys in the Republican Party you could call right of right. They are anarachists. They re for nothing. The video of Boehner was obtained by The Washington Post. Although he did not mention Jordan by name, it was clear Boehner was referring to him.Read more: The Hill",politics,"Oct 30, 2017"

Bill Clinton took at least 26 trips on the Lolita Express, a luxury jet fitted out with beds where prominent elitists allegedly had sex with young girls, ditching his Secret Service detail for 5 of those trips.Clinton chose to continue his association with Epstein even after, according to the Alliance to Rescue Victims of Trafficking,  everyone within his inner circles knew was a pedophile.

According to the Times, his name appeared on documents linked to companies that Manafort s firm created in Cyprus to receive payments from politicians and businesspeople in Eastern Europe.Mr. Manafort had been under investigation for violations of federal tax law, money laundering and whether he appropriately disclosed his foreign lobbying. Mr. Manafort has expected charges since this summer, when F.B.I. agents raided his home and prosecutors warned him that they planned to indict him. That warning raised speculation that Mr. Manafort might try to cut a deal to avoid prosecution.Mr. Trump s lawyer, Ty Cobb, said there were no concerns that Mr. Manafort would offer damaging information about the president in exchange for a deal.Some close to Mr. Manafort, including his former business partner Roger J. Stone Jr., have said he had nothing to offer that would help prosecutors build a case against Mr. Trump. He s not going to lie,  Mr. Stone said in September.Mr. Manafort, a veteran Republican strategist, joined the Trump campaign in March 2016 to help keep delegates from breaking with Mr. Trump in favor of establishment Republican candidates. Mr. Trump soon promoted him to chairman and chief strategist, a job that gave him control over day-to-day operations of the campaign.But Mr. Trump fired Mr. Manafort just months later, after reports that he received more than $12 million in undisclosed payments from Viktor F. Yanukovych, the former Ukrainian president and a pro-Russia politician. Mr. Manafort spent years as a political consultant for Mr. Yanukovych. ",politics,"Oct 30, 2017"

"REPUBLICANS CALL FOR ANSWERS: Did Wasserman-Schultz and Podesta Just Get Caught In A Big Lie?","Busted! Even moderate Republican Susan Collins of Maine said it best when she questioned how Wasserman-Schultz wouldn t know of the payment to Fusion GPS: It s difficult to imagine that a campaign chairman, that the head of the DNC would not know of an expenditure of this magnitude and significance. She and John Podesta testified last month that they knew nothing of the payment for a dossier on Trump Oops! Now, Republicans want answers:Congressional Republicans on Sunday called for Democrats John Podesta and Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz to provide further answers about their party paying for a dossier on President Trump s alleged ties to Russia, after telling Senate investigators last month that they had no knowledge of such payments.Wasserman Schultz is the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and Podesta was the chairman of Hillary Clinton s 2016 presidential campaign. Both groups purportedly paid millions for research that led to the dossier, The Washington Post reported last week.Trey Gowdy, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, suggested on  Fox News Sunday  that the DNC paying a law firm for so-called opposition research connected to the dossier was tantamount to money laundering. I m not an election law expert, but the good news is you don t have to be, to understand the absurdity of believing that you can launder all of your campaign money by just hiring a law firm,  said Gowdy, a former federal prosecutor.  So I m interested in that. He also seemed to question Podesta and Wasserman Schultz telling the Senate Intelligence Committee last month that they didn t know who paid for the dossier. I am also interested in sharing some memory tricks with folks at the DNC because no one can remember who paid $10 million to a law firm to do oppo research,  Gowdy said.  I find that stunning. $10 million and no one can remember who authorized it, who approved it, who said,  This is a really good idea. When questioned about the issue by Fox News last week on Capitol Hill, Wasserman Schultz said only:  I wasn t aware of the arrangement at all.

"JUST IN: DALLAS COWBOYS OWNER Jerry Jones Is Leading Effort To Oust NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell","Make no mistake about it, the NFL needs to show their fans that their players are serious about playing football, or the owners are going to continue to face catastrophic financial losses. The owners didn t hire Goodell to be their social justice director Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones led a conference call with 17 NFL owners on Thursday to discuss the possibility of halting commissioner Roger Goodell s pending contract extension.The owners on Thursday s conference call are unhappy with Goodell and the NFL s front office for a variety of reasons, including the player protests staged during the national anthem, issues regarding the relocation of teams to Los Angeles and the league s handling of the Ray Rice domestic violence case, sources told ESPN. You don t get to have this many messes over the years like Roger has had and survive it,  one owner said during the call.Sources have previously said that Jones has tried to stand in the way of any extension for Goodell.Last month, ESPN reported that Jones was impeding the progress of contract negotiations aimed at an extension for Goodell.  If not for Jerry,  one owner said last month in regard to the contract negotiations,  this deal would be done. The tension between Jones and Goodell is in part credited to the commissioner giving Cowboys running back Ezekiel Elliott a six-game suspension, which is currently being disputed in court.Another factor in the frustration with Goodell is the controversy surrounding players kneeling during the national anthem.Goodell won t mandate the players stand while Jones is threatening Cowboys onto their feet.Earlier this month, Jones said that any of his players who  disrespect  the flag won t be allowed to play. I know this, we cannot in the NFL in any way give the implication that we tolerate disrespecting the flag,  Jones, also the team s general manager, said after a 35-31 loss to the Green Bay Packers on October 8.The previous week, Jones knelt along with head coach Jason Garrett and all their players in the middle of the field on September 26 in a show of unity before they all stood for the anthem before their 28-17 win over the Arizona Cardinals. Spoke to Jerry Jones of the Dallas Cowboys yesterday. Jerry is a winner who knows how to get things done. Players will stand for Country!  President Trump tweeted.On the other side of the debate, Goodell strongly backed the players and criticized Trump for  an unfortunate lack of respect for the NFL.

Judge Jeanine started out her segment with Chaffetz talking about how Hillary Clinton and friends keep lying and obfuscating the law. She asked Chaffetz what he could tell her about what s being done, and asked Chaffetz,  What can you do? Chaffetz replied to Judge Jeanine:   Yeah, it s been more than a year now, and the State Department is holding tens of thousands of documents on a case that they claim is closed! And when I met with Attorney General Sessions much like Ron DeSantis did, I basically got a stiff arm. I got an Attorney General that said he would not comply, he wasn t going to do any sort of prosecutions and it s, it s  such a huge difference. When he was a Senator he would have never put up with that. But the deep state is very real. They re pushing back, and we need to do an investigation on this. Judge Jeanine asked if Attorney General Jeff Sessions was  afraid of them? She then went on to ask Chaffetz,  What does a president have to do to get Sessions to do his job?

"TREY GOWDY SLAMS Mueller Teams Over Leaks About Charges in Trump-Russia Investigation [Video]","Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, the leader of the House s top investigative committee, slammed special counsel Robert Mueller on Sunday for allowing the news media to learn that he and his legal team now have charges in their Russia investigation. In the only conversation I ve had with Robert Mueller, I stressed to him the importance of cutting out the leaks,  Gowdy, chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, told  Fox News Sunday.   It s kind of ironic that the people charged with investigating the law and the violations of the law would violate the law. Mueller and his team have for roughly the past five months been leading a Justice Department investigation into whether anybody associated with the President Trump s 2016 White House campaign colluded with Russia to influence the election outcome. On Friday night, CNN reported that Mueller s team has filed the first charges in the case with a federal grand jury.IN THE MEAN TIME, TRUMP S LAWYER SAYS THERE S NO WORRY: Donald Trump s lawyer says President Trump is not worried about what his former campaign chairman Paul Manafort or former national security adviser Mike Flynn told special counsel Robert Mueller in his investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.Ty Cobb told the New York Times Trump is confident neither Manafort nor Flynn has incriminating information about the president. The president has no concerns in terms of any impact, as to what happens to them, on his campaign or on the White House,  Cobb said.Prosecutors on Mueller s team reportedly warned Manafort to expect an indictment when they raided his Virginia home in July.CNN reported late Friday the first charges have been filed in the Russia investigation and anyone charged could be taken into custody as soon as Monday. It is not known who is being charged in the case. Trump likes and respects Mr. Manafort and appreciates the work he did for him during the three months he was with the campaign. He likes General Flynn personally, but understands that they have their own path with the special counsel,  Cobb said.  I think he would be sad for them, as a friend and a former colleague, if the process results in punishment or indictments. But to the extent that that happens, that s beyond his control.

"JUST IN: Obama Campaign Secretly Paid $972,000 To Fund Creation Of Fake Trump Dossier","Well, well, well As a famous  reverend  once said, Obama s  chickens have come home too roost OR AS MIKE HUCKABEE SAID:.@GovMikeHuckabee: I think it's easier to find Bigfoot and Amelia Earhart than it is to find collusion between the Russians and Donald Trump pic.twitter.com/RA68QqD9kG  Fox News (@FoxNews) October 29, 2017Obama for America (OFA), the former president s political organization, has directed nearly a million dollars to the very same law firm that funneled money to Fusion GPS, the firm behind the infamous Steele dossier.Since April of 2016, Obama For America (OFA) has paid over $972,000 to Perkins Coie, records filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) show.The Washington Post reported last week that Perkins Coie, an international law firm, was directed by both the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Hillary Clinton s campaign to retain Fusion GPS in April of 2016 to dig up dirt on then-candidate Donald Trump. Fusion GPS then hired Christopher Steele, a former British spy, to compile a dossier of allegations that Trump and his campaign actively colluded with the Russian government during the 2016 election. Though many of the claims in the dossier have been directly refuted, none of the dossier s allegations of collusion have been independently verified. Lawyers for Steele admitted in court filings last April that his work was not verified and was never meant to be made public.FEC records as well as federal court records show that Marc Elias, the Perkins Coie lawyer whom the Washington Post reported was responsible for the payments to Fusion GPS on behalf of Clinton s campaign and the DNC, also previously served as a counsel for OFA. In Shamblin v. Obama for America, a 2013 case in federal court in Florida, federal court records list Elias as simultaneously serving as lead attorney for both OFA and the DNC.OFA, which managed Obama s successful re-election campaign in 2012, retooled after that campaign to focus on enacting the president s agenda during his final term in office. The group reorganized again after the 2016 election and planned to use its staff and resources to oppose President Donald Trump. During the entire 2016 campaign cycle, the group spent only $4.5 million, according to FEC records.Federal records show that Hillary Clinton s official campaign organization, Hillary For America, paid just under $5.1 million to Perkins Coie in 2016. The DNC paid nearly $5.4 million to the law firm in 2016.The timing and nature of the payments to Perkins Coie by Obama s official campaign arm raise significant questions about whether OFA was funding Fusion GPS, how much Obama and his team knew about the contents and provenance of the dossier long before its contents were made public, and whether the president or his government lieutenants knowingly used a partisan political document to justify official government actions targeting the president s political opponents named in the dossier. According to the Washington Post, Fusion GPS was first retained by Perkins Coie on behalf of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign in April of 2016.At the same time that Hillary s campaign, Obama s campaign organization, and the DNC were simultaneously paying Perkins Coie, the spouse of one of Fusion GPS s key employees was working directly for Obama in the West Wing. Shailagh Murray, a former Washington Post reporter-turned-political operative, was serving as a top communications adviser to Obama while the Obama administration was reportedly using information from the dossier to justify secret surveillance of Trump campaign staff. Murray is married to Neil King, a former Wall Street Journal reporter who was hired by Fusion GPS in December of 2016. While at the Wall Street Journal, King worked alongside Fusion GPS s core team, even sharing bylines with Glenn Simpson, the Fusion GPS executive who personally hired Steele to probe Trump s alleged Russia connections.As you might suspect,  Neil King was a thick as thieves with CNN, the WSJ and the Washington Post. The lines between investigating the truth and fake news were blurred in a big way when King and Catan jumped from the WSJ to Fusion GPS. As the Daily Caller reported:CNN s reporting on the Trump-Russia dossier has left out at least one crucial fact: the close ties between the network and the opposition research firm at the center of the dossier controversy.CNN s reporting on the dossier, led by justice correspondent Evan Perez, has been favorable to the firm, Fusion GPS, and hyped the dossier s credibility. Left out of Perez s reporting, which has relied largely on unnamed sources, is his personal closeness to Fusion GPS  operatives. Fusion has repeatedly been described in Senate testimonies as a smear-for-hire operation that manufactures misleading or false media narratives for its clients. Another Fusion founder, Tom Catan, worked as a reporter for the Journal at the same time as Perez and Simpson. The third Fusion co-founder, Peter Fritsch, worked above Perez and Simpson as the senior national security editor.KING (FUSION GPS) ON THE RIGHT -Photo posted on Facebook by Perez (CNN)Simpson and Fritsch left the WSJ in 2011 to launch Fusion. Perez jumped from the paper to CNN in 2013. Another longtime Journal reporter, Neil King, left the paper to join Fusion in December 2016.PEREZ ( LEFT) AND ALL OF FUSION The importance of the fake dossier and how it was shopped around to the press comes into focus when you realize that Obama, Clinton and the DNC had Fusion GPS create this smear campaign on Trump. This also opened the door for the phony Russia collusion investigation whereby the Trump campaign and family members were spied on because of something fake.Read more: The Federalist ",politics,"Oct 29, 2017"
"BREAKING: ONLY MLB Player To Kneel During National Anthem ARRESTED For Pulling Gun On Delivery Woman","When Oakland Athletics catcher Bruce Maxwell took a knee during the national anthem before their game against the Texas Rangers, the Oakland Athletics immediately tweeeted out their support for him. To date, Maxwell is the only MLB player who has chosen to disrespect our flag as a way to help BLM push an anti-cop movement.Here is the Oakland A s response to Bruce Maxwell kneeling during our nation s national anthem:pic.twitter.com/EHXwg8Zpax  A's, But Spooky   (@Athletics) September 24, 2017Last week, Maxwell was caught lying about being denied service at a local restaurant after kneeling for the anthem.FOX News   Oakland A s catcher Bruce Maxwell, 26, claimed this week that a waiter in his Alabama hometown of Huntsville refused him service after identifying him as the MLB player who took the knee during  The Star Spangled Banner  last month   only the waiter has a very different version of events and he told Fox News that was far from what went down. He is outright lying. This is really upsetting as he was given full service, I didn t even know who Bruce Maxwell was,  Matt Henry, a 42-year-old waiter at Keegan s Public House, told Fox News.  This all started because I carded his friend who wanted to order a beer. According to Henry, an Alabama native, Maxwell was dining with local Democratic councilman Devyn Keith and another friend who produced an expired ID, and the server refused to serve him a drink   which upset the friend, who followed him into the kitchen. He asked me,  Don t you know who Bruce Maxwell is? , and told me I was making everyone feel uncomfortable. Nobody was even paying attention to them,  Henry claimed. I didn t know anything about him or the kneeling. All I know is a friend of mine 15 years ago lost his job for serving someone a drink who happened to be underage, so if anyone looks under 30, I m going to card them. The waiter said that the councilman then complained to the restaurant s manager about Maxwell being uncomfortable, and the manager simply swapped me to another table, and that it was  no big deal. The restaurant manager on duty that day, Anne Whalen   who requested the restaurant name not be used without permission from the owner   also told Fox News that Maxwell s story being portrayed in the media could not be further from the truth. Matt came to me and told me that a guy wanted a beer but his ID was not valid and I told him he absolutely could not give it to him, we can go to jail for that in the state of Alabama,  the manager said. It was his friend causing all the fuss, none of us even knew who this baseball player was. I told him I had no idea who he was going on about,  she said.  Eventually Matt just asked if we could put another server on the table so I did.   I can t believe the story. Today, it was announced that Maxwell was arrested in Arizona after a food delivery person told authorities that he pointed a gun at her.TMZ  Scottsdale PD tells us Maxwell, 26, was arrested Saturday at 6:08 PM at his Scottsdale, AZ home. Cops say the alleged victim was a female food delivery driver who told them Maxwell pointed a gun at her.It s unclear what led up to the incident.SPD says Maxwell was booked on charges of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and disorderly conduct.Cops say he is in custody and awaiting his initial appearance in front of a judge.

When you think about racial equality and civil rights, which political party comes to mind, the Republican s or the Democrat s? Most people would probably say the Democrats. But that answer isn t correct.Since its founding in 1829, the Democratic Party has fought against every major civil rights initiative, and has a long history of discrimination. The Democratic Party defended slavery, started the Civil War, opposed reconstruction, founded the Ku Klux Klan, imposed segregation, perpetrated lynching and fought against the Civil Rights Acts of the 1950 s and 1960 s. In contrast, the Republican Party was founded in 1854 as an anti-slavery party. Its mission was to stop the spread of slavery into the new western territory with the aim of abolishing it entirely.

"NEW STUDY Shows Why Atheists and People Who Agree With Immigrants That Bash Their Country Use LESS BRAIN POWER","It s not at all surprising that at least 28% of Democrats consider themselves to be atheists. Fascinating This has to be embarrassing . . . if you re an atheist. A new study performed at the University of York used targeted magnetism to shut down part of the brain. The result: belief in God disappeared among more than 30 percent of participants.That in itself may not seem so embarrassing, but consider that the specific part of the brain they frazzled was the posterior medial frontal cortex the part associated with detecting and solving problems, i.e., reasoning and logic.In other words, when you shut down the part of the brain most associated with logic and reasoning, greater levels of atheism result.You ve heard the phrase,  I don t have enough faith to be an atheist ? Apparently, we can now also say,  I have too many brains to be an atheist.   The American VisionDaily Mail  The study was carried out by Dr Keise Izuma from the University of York and Colin Holbrook from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA).They recruited 38 participants with an average age of 21, to take part in the study.Each of these participants said they held significant religious beliefs, and the majority held moderate to extremely conservative political beliefs.Political views were important because it suggested they were more likely to have stronger viewpoints on immigration.Half of these participants formed part of a control group and received a low-level  sham  procedure that did not affect their brains.The other half received enough energy through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to lower activity in the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC).This part of the brain, located near the surface and roughly a few inches up from the forehead, is associated with detecting problems and triggering responses that address them.Following the treatment, all the participants were first asked to think about death before being asked questions about their religious beliefs and their feelings about immigrants.The death task including writing brief responses on the subject of their own death.To address their levels of prejudice, participants were asked to read two essays   one critical and one positive   written by an immigrant from Latin America about the US.After reading each essay, participants rated how much they liked the person who wrote the essay and how much they agreed with their views.Religious belief was measured using a version of the Supernatural Belief Scale.Items were presented in random order and rated according to the same scale used in the immigrant ratings.Questions included:  There exists an all-powerful, all-knowing, loving God ,  There exist good personal spiritual beings, whom we might call angels  and  There exists an evil personal spiritual being, whom we might call the Devil. Circa   So how do Democrats and Republicans stack up when it comes to having faith vs. athesists?According to the Pew Research Center,  nones    people who don t identify with any religion   make up 23 percent of American adults.In the Democratic Party, that number is even bigger. 28 percent of Democrats are non-religious, Pew s research shows.Conversely, people who identify as non-religious are much more likely to vote Democratic. 70 percent of self-identifying atheists, for example, voted for President Obama in 2012, according to Pew.One of those atheists is James White, a Texas delegate for Hillary Clinton at this year s DNC. At the convention on Monday, White was wearing a shirt that read,  I m actually an atheist. White said he still feels it s necessary to publicly broadcast his beliefs to promote acceptance of atheism within the party. When we make it safe for people to realize that a nearly 60-year-old Texas middle-aged white guy is an atheist and a Democrat, those things make it easier for others to come forward too,  he said. There has been some progress, White said. Earlier this year, the Texas Democratic Party adopted three secular resolutions into its official policy platform.The investigators additionally found that the magnetic stimulation had the greatest effect on reactions to the critical author in the essay test. We think that hearing criticisms of your group s values, perhaps especially from a person you perceive as an outsider, is processed as an ideological sort of threat,  said Dr Izuma. One way to respond to such threats is to  double down  on your group values, increasing your investment in them, and reacting more negatively to the critic,  he continued. When we disrupted the brain region that usually helps detect and respond to threats, we saw a less negative, less ideologically motivated reaction to the critical author and his opinions.

If you want to take a deeper dive on this issue, read the book  Clinton Cash,  by Peter Schweizer, president of the Government Accountability Institute. But here are the basics.A decade ago, a long-time Clinton Foundation donor, Frank Giustra, sold his uranium company to another firm, Uranium One. With that deal, Uranium One now owned uranium mines in the western U.S., including Wyoming, with about 20 percent of U.S. uranium production capacity, and about ten percent of the actual uranium mined in the U.S.In 2009, Rosatom, Russia s nuclear agency, took a 17-percent position in Uranium One. A year later, in the summer of 2010, Rosatom bought majority control of the Uranium One, effectively giving the Russian government-controlled entity proprietary access to one-fifth of the U.S. uranium supply.And then there s that whole phony Trump-Russian dossier story Watch, as Paul Joseph Watson DESTROYS the liberal media for force-feeding their viewers with  24/7 phony Trump-Russian coverage, without having so much as ONE actual identifiable or legitimate source to back up their assertions.

Calls A Pie Chart A Pie Crust&Doesnt Know Difference Between 1.4 Billion Dollars 1.4 Trillion Dollars","Is Representative Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) the member of Congress who s receiving Alzheimer s drugs from the D.C. pharmacist who revealed a dirty little Washington secret about the drugs he delivers to Congress members only 2 weeks ago? Nancy s even more bizarre than usual behavior has led a lot of Americans to question her mental capacity and wonder if she s one of the members who s receiving the medications to treat  serious health problems ?Something is clearly wrong with Nancy Pelosi. Why is everyone in Washington DC and in the media ignoring her bizarre and incoherent interviews that leave viewers wondering how in the world she is fit to serve. American Mirror   During her recent weekly press conference, the House Minority Leader was seen stumbling over words, uttering gibberish, staring blankly at reporters, and on at least two occasions, suffering from face spasms. What an event-filled morning has been,  Pelosi began, botching her opening line.It went downhill from there. Really one that, uh, marks a transf  for  she said, before staring at reporters barely 10 seconds into the appearance, and finally saying,  transformative moment Moments later, she confused  trillions  and  billions. When President Bush left office the deficit was 1.4 trillion,  she said as she suffered an apparent facial spasm,  uh, trillion dollars. So you re talking about an enormous amount of money. The national debt increased by an enormous amount   the debt was 1.4 billion in terms of the deficit. Watch her incoherent interview here:A Washington D.C. pharmacy revealed on Wednesday that they deliver medications that treat  serious health problems  to members of Congress, including medications to treat Alzheimer s disease.Pharmacy owner, Dr. Mike Kim, said that he has  gotten used to  knowing highly sensitive information about some of the most powerful people in Washington, STAT reported. At first it s cool, and then you realize, I m filling some drugs that are for some pretty serious health problems as well. And these are the people that are running the country,  Kim said, listing treatments for conditions like diabetes and Alzheimer s.Kim expressed concern over some of the serious health problems that members of Congress have because the diseases could severely limit their ability to serve in their elected positions. It makes you kind of sit back and say,  Wow, they re making the highest laws of the land and they might not even remember what happened yesterday.   Daily Wire ",politics,"Oct 27, 2017"
"HOUSTON TEXAN PLAYERS THREATEN Owner For Telling NFL Team Owners We cant have the inmates running the prison During Private Meeting","The NYP reported that the players whom Bob McNair employs were not happy about his comments at a recent NFL owners meeting.McNair sparked the outrage by saying,  We can t have the inmates running the prison,  during an NFL owners meeting one day after he and 10 other NFL representatives met with current and former players to discuss the issues behind the national anthem protests. McNair has apologized for the racially insensitive analogy, but count outspoken Seahawks star Richard Sherman   who will play against the Texans this weekend   among those who don t believe the apology was sincere.The Texans nearly staged a team-wide walkout Friday, a few hours after McNair apologized for comparing NFL players to  inmates  in a prison, ESPN reported.Texans players wanted to walkout today in response to owner Bob McNair s comments, per @sarahbarshop. Had to be persuaded to stay.  Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) October 27, 2017Houston s best offensive player, wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins, skipped practice for  personal reasons,  but ESPN later confirmed it was in response to McNair s comments. Head coach Bill O Brien said he is  100 percent  with his players.Texans offensive lineman Duane Brown said McNair s comments  sickened  him and were  horrible,  according to the Houston Chronicle. Brown also said he wasn t surprised by the comments, and that Houston players are not done dealing with the issue.Brown s wife also spoke out on the issue. My husband has put his BODY & MIND on the line for your team for 10 YRS & to you he is an  inmate,  Devi Brown wrote.  You owe these players RESPECT & support. ESPN reported the Texans will  do something  before the game Sunday but have not decided what yet.Texans rookie Treston Decoud tweeted,  I don t believe he is the only owner that feel that way   smh. NFL players may not be happy with the Houston Texan team owner s choice of words when he told other team owners in a private meeting that,  We can t have the inmates running the prison , but how far off base was Texan s owner Bob McNair when he used the commonly used phrase?While the Houston Texans may only have 13 players who ve been arrested for crimes, they re not exactly a group of choir boys either. Here are just a few examples of  NFL teams and the number of players who ve been arrested on those teams since 2000. Keep in mind that each NFL team has 53 players.Minnesota Vikings Number of arrests: 49 Perhaps the most notable of the Vikings  arrests was the  Love Boat  scandal, during which Fred Smoot, Daunte Culpepper, Bryant McKinnie and Moe Williams were all arrested. Adrian Peterson s child abuse case along with 18 DUI cases were also among the Vikings  arrests over the years.Denver Broncos Number of arrests: 47 Brandon Marshall accounted for four of these arrests while he was with the team, including two instances of domestic violence and one domestic dispute. The Broncos have had 12 instances of domestic violence since 2000, as well as 12 DUIsCincinnati Bengals Number of arrests: 44 The Bengals currently employ Adam Jones, who has the most arrests of any NFL player since 2000 (10) and was even arrested earlier this year for poking a security guard in the eye. They also employed the player with the third most arrests since 2000, Chris Henry (6), who passed away in 2009. Overall, the Bengals have had nine assaults, nine DUIs and six domestic violence cases over the past 17 years.Tennessee Titans Number of arrests: 36 Kenny Britt, who has the second-most individual arrests since 2000 (seven times), was arrested six times within a span of two years with Tennessee. In total, the Titans have had 10 DUIs, four assaults and four domestic violence cases over that span.Tampa Bay Buccaneers Number of arrests: 36 The Buccaneers have had 11 DUIs since 2000, as well as four drug charges and four instances of domestic violence. Former Patriots cornerback Aqib Talib was arrested on gun and assault charges while with Tampa Bay.Jacksonville Jaguars Number of arrests: 35 The Jaguars have had four gun charges and five drug charges to go with their seven DUIs. Among those drug charges was wide receiver Matt Jones, who was spotted cutting up cocaine in his car by police in 2008.Cleveland Browns Number of arrests: 33 Johnny Manziel recently made the list after he was accused of domestic violence in early 2016. Meanwhile, Dont  Stallworth was charged with a DUI manslaughter in 2009, while Ausar Walcott was charged with attempted murder in 2013. The Browns also have six drug charges and five gun charges.Chicago Bears Number of arrests: 32 The Bears have had seven assaults and 10 DUIs since 2000. Among those arrests was Lance Briggs, who crashed his Lamborghini into a pole and left the scene of the accident   a crime that he pled guilty to.Kansas City Chiefs Number of arrests: 32 The Chiefs employed Jovan Belcher, who fatally shot his girlfriend 10 times before going to the team s facility and shooting himself in the head with a gun. They also employed Larry Johnson, who was arrested four times   including twice for domestic disputes. Kansas City has 10 DUI cases and four cases of theft/burglary since 2000.Miami Dolphins Number of arrests: 31 The Dolphins have seven domestic violence cases and seven assault and battery cases to go with their eight DUI arrests. They also had Ricky Williams, who was charged with reckless driving after going 126 mph on the highway once.Baltimore Ravens Number of arrests: 27 The Ravens have several high-profile arrests since 2000, including Ray Rice s domestic violence case and Ray Lewis  murder charge. They also had Terrence Cody, who was indicted on charges of animal cruelty after one of his dogs died. Cody also illegally owned an alligator. Seattle Seahawks Number of arrests: 27 Lofa Tatupu, who was arrested for a DUI during which he had a .155 blood alcohol content, was one of 11 Seahawks players to be charged with a DUI. Seattle has also had six domestic violence instances over that span.Carolina Panthers Number of arrests: 22 Panthers players have had six DUIs, four assaults, three gun charges, three domestic violence cases and three drug cases since 2000. One of the more prominent cases involved defensive end Greg Hardy, who threw his victim onto a couch covered in guns among other instances of domestic violence.Black Lives Matter posterchild for disrespecting our flag, former 49 ers QB Colin Kaepernick s team is in the middle of the pack for team members with most criminal arrests and convictions:San Francisco 49ers Number of arrests: 25 The 49ers have 13 DUI charges since 2000 along with three domestic violence cases. One of those cases involved former fullback Bruce Miller, who later was charged with assault after allegedly assaulting his 70-year-old father in a hotel in San FranciscoWhile the Houston Texans team doesn t land in the top of the list for players with most criminal convictions on their team, they certainly have their fair share. Sadly, only having 13 arrests on their team makes them look good compared to the other teams with more arrests for criminal activity. Houston Texans Number of arrests: 13 The Texans were founded in 2002, and have overall been pretty good about staying out of trouble compared to the rest of the league. Houston has four DUI charges, including one to Jacoby Jones that he pleaded guilty to.Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman sounded off on McNair s comments, as he attempted to throw gasoline on the fire:I can appreciate ppl being candid. Don t apologize! You meant what you said. Showing true colors allows ppl to see you for who you are.  Richard Sherman (@RSherman_25) October 27, 2017Sherman isn t shy about his hate for cops. His big mouth and unnecessary disrespect for a law-enforcement officer didn t end up well for him, as he was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct towards a police officer in 2014.Empire Sports   Sherman is known for his cockiness on the field and a vocabulary that can only be described as  trash-talk.  His passion on the field often carries over to the after-game interviews, and he is the type of player Seahawks fans either love or love to hate.Despite his reputation for attitude within the NFL, witnesses to Sherman s altercation with a Seattle police officer were shocked by his behavior. It was like he just picked off Peyton in the Super Bowl, and ran it back for a touchdown or something. His cockiness was at an all-time high!  Said Curt Johnson, a bystander to the incident.Sherman s problems arose when a police officer witnessed him jaywalking, and gave him a warning not to do it again. The officer later admitted that he wasn t so much worried about the jaywalking law in Seattle, but the fact that it was a busy street and Sherman could have been hurt, as several pedestrians have been hit by cars in the same area over the last few months. He asked me if I knew who he was, and I said, of course, I m a huge fan.  Said Patrolman Mike Stephens.  [Sherman] then continued to say,  Then you know that I own [expletive] Seattle, and any [expletive] street I want to cross I can, no matter where I decide to [expletive] cross it. Stephens apparently tried to apologize, and explain to Sherman that he was just doing his job and that Sherman s celebrity status in the city did not give him the right to curse anyone. He told me that I was a terrible police officer, and said I should just go eat some [expletive] donuts.  Said Officer Stephens.  He went off on me about how he was doing better in life than I was, and said that I shouldn t even watch a Seattle game again because I didn t deserve to witness the  greatness  that was him on a football field. Sherman was arrested and charged with jaywalking and disorderly conduct towards a police officer in the course of his duty.",politics,"Oct 27, 2017"

"INVESTIGATION LAUNCHED: SECOND TRESPASSER May Have Been Near President Trump In U.S. Capitol [Video]","The news that a second man was able to sneak into the press gaggle inside the Capitol building earlier this week is a huge red flag. With all of the hate and leftist extremists out there, the security should be very tight. It s not Check out the news below that a second man bragged about being able to sneak into the press area:Congressional security officials Thursday were investigating a report of a second man who may have passed through security to join a press gaggle inside the U.S. Capitol building earlier this week awaiting President Trump, sources said.News of a possible second intruder came after another protester managed to infiltrate a group of reporters waiting for Trump, who had been meeting with lawmakers on Capitol Hill, the source told Fox News.The second person was described as a middle-aged man who stood about 6 feet, 3 inches tall and was dressed in a gray suit and bow tie. When asked by reporters who he worked for, the man replied,  I m a tourist,  and bragged about being able to sneak inside the Ohio Clock Corridor in the Capitol building. Via: FOX 5INVESTIGATION LAUNCHED INTO TRESPASSER WHO WAS ALREADY ON WATCH LIST:The liberal protester who earlier this week infiltrated a group of reporters in a secure area of the Capitol, tossed mini-Russian flags and shouted  treason  at President Trump had been on a watch list before Tuesday s incident, Fox News has learned.The protester was identified as Ryan Clayton, an activist from an anti-Trump group who was later arrested and charged with unlawful conduct.The U.S. Capitol Police Board is conducting an internal investigation into how someone without a press credential   and on a watch list   was able to slip into the secure area and get so close to the president. This was a monumental f up,  a senior congressional security source told Fox News.Clayton has been on a  watch list  kept by the Capitol Police, a source said, and was denied entry to the complex earlier that day when an officer recognized him at the Russell Senate Office Building.But later on, officers in a tunnel leading to the Capitol did not check his ID to see if he had a pass or badge, the source said. He used an outdated visitor s pass to enter the Capitol through a tunnel connecting the Rayburn House Office building. After clearing the security checkpoint, he made his way outside the Senate chamber, where he blended in with credentialed congressional reporters and stood just feet away from Trump.A source also said Clayton was in possession of a four-day old pass for the location of the House Sensitive Compartmentalized Information Facility, which is home to the House Intelligence Committee. Fox News is told there is no evidence so far that Clayton attempted to access that facility.PROTESTER ON WATCH LIST MAKES HIS WAY INTO PRESS GROUP TO THROW RUSSIAN FLAGS AT POTUS:As we previously reported: A protester on Tuesday shouted  Treason!  at President Trump and threw mini Russian flags at him as he arrived for a meeting with Senate Republicans: The unhinged left is at it again They only make themselves look like lunatics when they pull stunts like this:A protester threw Russian flags at President Trump on Tuesday as he entered the GOP policy lunch.The protester could be heard shouting  Trump is treason  as the president walked by.Random guy threw Russian flags at Trump and shouted  Trump is treason  pic.twitter.com/stVfDOtMAB  a da ch vez (@aidachavez_) October 24, 2017 Why are you talking about tax cuts when you should be talking about treason?  the man could be heard shouting in videos.He was later identified as Americans Take Action s Ryan Clayton.Clayton is known for expressing his anti-Trump views by tossing Russia flags.

"SICK OF HOLLYWOOD LIBERALS and PERVERTS? Heres Your Chance To Support Hollywood CONSERVATIVES In NEW Movie Let There Be Light That President Trump Just Tweeted About [VIDEO]","Actor Kevin Sorbo and his wife, actress Sam Sorbo, are an anomaly in Hollywood. Both of them are committed conservatives who are dedicated to raising their children with values and morals, and most importantly, they put their faith first in all aspects of their lives. Kevin and Sam Sorbo are the real deal. If you re sick and tired of reading about the rampant sexual abuse that appears to be the norm in Hollywood, and watching leftist actors and comedians using severed heads of President Trump to get a laugh, perhaps their new movie  Let Their Be Light , that opens in theaters tomorrow, is the movie you ve been waiting for. At a time when Harvey Weinstein and other Hollywood elites face growing accusations of sexual impropriety, Sean Hannity has emerged as a film producer eager to see more family-friendly films that don t shy from upholding Judeo-Christian values. In fact, for Mr. Hannity, the timing couldn t be better. I think the old paradigm of Hollywood is crumbling right in front of our eyes,  Mr. Hannity said during a phone interview with The Washington Times.  We re on the cutting edge of getting ahead of this because the demand has been there, and [producers] have had no desire to fulfill it. That is, except for most independent filmmakers like Mr. Hannity, who agreed to become an executive producer and fund most of the $3 million budget for  Let There Be Light,  a faith-based drama opening in theaters Thursday that stars Kevin Sorbo, known for  Hercules: The Legendary Journeys. He s the best executive producer anybody could ever ask for,  Mr. Sorbo said of Mr. Hannity.  He said,  Here s the money. Go make the movie and show me when you re done.In the film, which Mr. Sorbo also directed, he plays Dr. Sol Harkens, a famous book-writing atheist who, while living for the crowd s roars of approval while skewering Christians in packed debates, also struggles with loneliness, the death of his young son and the leery attitudes of his two remaining sons, who are being raised by his Christian ex-wife, Katy, who is portrayed by Mr. Sorbo s own wife, Sam Sorbo.The executive producer of the  Let Their Be Light  movie, Sean Hannity tweeted about the Sorbo s movie: Let There Be Light  opens THIS FRIDAY! Locations listed at https://t.co/9hkyEX1UVi https://t.co/NxlxjswYJG  Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 26, 2017President Trump retweeted Sean Hannity s tweet about the  Let Their Be Light  movie, and said that Hannity s movie will be  another Sean success! Will be another Sean success! https://t.co/SlNTENvJLA  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 26, 2017The couple s two sons also feature in  Let There Be Light. Sean Hannity interviewed the very talented Sorbo family recently, and asked them what it was like for their family to work together to make the movie:After Miss Sorbo first came up with the idea for the film, she approached veteran screenwriter Dan Gordon ( The Hurricane,   Wyatt Earp ), who agreed to co-write the script with her. A random contact from Mr. Hannity led to his immediately bankrolling the film. Sean Hannity, kind of out of the blue, called my husband and said,  I want to do a faith-based movie, and I want to work with you,  Miss Sorbo recalled.Not long after, Mr. Hannity, who juggles two full-time jobs in radio and TV, found himself in a pitch meeting in New York with the Sorbos and Mr. Gordon. Twenty minutes later, he cut them a check.Here s a sneak peek at the movie  Let There Be Light : It s better than I ever dreamed it could be in terms of the quality, the acting and the cinematic value,  Mr. Hannity said.  I think with all that s happening out in Hollywood, there might be an opportunity here to make more of these independent films that people will go see, and that s why I wanted to lend my name to it.   For entire story: Washington Times Sam Sorbo is an awesome actress, a loving wife, an amazing mom who homeschools her children and we re proud to call her our friend.

Oh   and it s a 13-year-old boy who s got feelings for the main character s crush.Of course, the character s coming out as gay doesn t to do with moving the plotline forward so much as it pushes the pro-LBGT agenda the media are determined to cram down your throat   or, if that fails, your kid s. Andi Mack is a story about  tweens  figuring out who they are,  said Disney Channel in a statement.  (Creator) Terri Minsky, the cast and everyone involved in the show takes great care in ensuring that it s appropriate for all audiences and sends a powerful message about inclusion and respect for humanity. Producers say the  coming out  scene will have the barely-a-teenager telling a friend about his feelings for a boy at school. His friend will tell him it s A-O.K. and perfectly natural for guys to like guys, because Disney s all about creating a brainwashing  supportive  atmosphere. The company added they consulted with several outside advocacy groups to make sure the scene was  age-appropriate  and sufficiently inclusive, including gay activist groups GLAAD and PFLAG, along with the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy and Common Sense Media.Groups that would ve likely had a different opinion about teaching pre-pubescent elementary school kids the importance of being gay didn t make the list.According to ratings data, the median age of Andi Mack s viewers is 10. In fact, the show is the Disney channel s No. 1-rated program among kids six-14. Because nothing says  inclusivity  like teaching six-year-olds about being gay, whether their parents like it or not.

The man just lied about President Trump and called for his impeachment! All Pelosi can say is great? She goes on to dance around the topic of impeachment. When Reid brings up Mueller, Pelosi calls him  mother Reid then asked Pelosi:  If you become Speaker of the House in January 2019, will you push for the impeachment of this president? WORD SALAD FROM PELOSI:Pelosi responded:  You know, I ve served a long time on the intel ethics committee in the Congress. It s one of the dues that I ve paid to the caucus and it s only about the facts and the law. If he s broken the law, you would think there would be a bipartisan move to do that. But because we don t like his policy and we don t like his attitude well, don t let me go into all the things we don t like about the president on a Sunday morning. Uh, uh, that s, you know, if people have the facts  that s why I would like us to have an independent, uh, commission. We have an investigation within the Justice Department. We have an investigation within the Congress. We should have an outside investigation to what, as to what happened. Reid shot back trying to bait Pelosi:  If Robert Mueller comes back with a report saying that there is evidence of collusion between Donald Trump s campaign and Russia, do you believe he should be impeached?

"DNC CHAIR PEREZ Says Trump Didnt Win&Decides To Rewrite Constitution Without Electoral College&","DNC chairman Tom Perez decided to create his own reality during a speech on Tuesday. This is such a Democrat thing they love to make up a false narrative and push it over and over to the sheeple who follow them. It s really pitiful that after so many months that all the Democrats have is this lie The electoral college is a brilliant creation because it gives balance to voters Would you want California and New York deciding our elections? That s what would happen without the electoral college. We bet that Perez already knows this but is counting on the uneducated voters to buy into it .Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez incorrectly stated  the Electoral College is not a creation of the Constitution  during a Tuesday night speech.(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = 'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.10';  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));DNC Chair Tom Perez incorrectly claims  the Electoral College is not a creation of the Constitution Posted by Fox & Friends on Friday, October 27, 2017 The Electoral College is not a creation of the Constitution,  Perez said during a lecture at Indiana University Law School.  It doesn t have to be there. The Electoral College, a mechanism for indirect election of the president created by the Founding Fathers as a compromise between smaller states and larger states, is clearly laid out in Article II of the Constitution:  Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress. Perez has previously stated that President Donald Trump  didn t win  last November s election because Hillary Clinton won the popular vote:Following his comment, Perez went on to explain his hopes that states agree to a  national popular vote compact,  in which states agree to give their allocated electoral votes to the winner of the national popular vote. There s a national popular vote compact in which a number of states have passed a bill that says, we will allocate our vote, our electoral votes, to the person who wins the national popular vote once other states totaling 170 electoral votes do the same,  Perez said.  I m frankly proud to tell you that the first state to pass such a law was Maryland. The main supporters of the plan put forward by Perez seem to understand it is a plan to circumvent the system created by the Constitution, not an argument that the system doesn t exist.The comment from Perez came during a lecture honoring former Indiana Democratic Sen. Birch Bayh, who was accused last year of sexual assault by a writer who said Bayh groped her in the backseat of a limousine. VIA: WFBOUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE ELECTORAL COLLEGE:PLEASE SHARE THIS WITH THE CLUELESS LEFT!   If the president were elected by unfiltered national vote, small and rural states would become irrelevant, and campaigns would spend their time in large, populous districts.   The Electoral College remains in place over two centuries after the framers of the Constitution empowered it to select presidents. Though occasionally maligned, this system of electing a chief executive has been incredibly successful for the American people.The Founding Fathers created the Electoral College after much debate and compromise, but it has provided stability to the process of picking presidents. Though the winner of the national popular vote typically takes the presidency, that vote failed to determine the winner in four elections: 1824, 1876, 1888, and 2000.Some see the Electoral College as a peculiar and mystifying institution that ensures only a few, select individuals will ever cast a direct vote for president in the United States. Others complain that the system rewards smaller states with more proportional power than the large ones.Every four years, around election time, there are murmurs about revamping the system and moving toward a direct, national popular vote.The Founders  CollegeAs one of The Heritage Foundations legal experts, Hans von Spakovsky, noted in a paper on the Electoral College:  In creating the basic architecture of the American government, the Founders struggled to satisfy each state s demand for greater representation while attempting to balance popular sovereignty against the risk posed to the minority from majoritarian rule. Some elements of the Electoral College, such as the indirect vote through intermediaries, were hotly debated at the 1787 Constitutional Convention. It was eventually justified in part as a stopgap to potentially reverse the vote if the people elected a criminal, traitor, or similar kind of heinous person. The Founders wanted to empower democratic elements in the American system, but they feared a kind of pure, unrestrained democracy that had brought down great republics of the past.The product of the Founders  compromise has been well balanced and enduring, and we would be wise to leave it intact.Alexander Hamilton defended the Electoral College in Federalist 68. He argued that it was important for the people as a whole to have a great deal of power in choosing their president, but it was also  desirable  that  the immediate election should be made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station, and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice. Hamilton also wrote that this system of intermediaries would produce a greater amount of stability, and that an     intermediate body of electors will be much less apt to convulse the community with any extraordinary or violent movements, than the choice of one who was himself to be the final object of the public wishes. As students of ancient history, the Founders feared the destructive passions of direct democracy, and as recent subjects of an overreaching monarch, they equally feared the rule of an elite unresponsive to the will of the people. The Electoral College was a compromise, neither fully democratic nor aristocratic.The Constitution states:Each state shall appoint, in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct, a number of electors, equal to the whole number of senators and representatives to which the state may be entitled in the Congress.In addition to balancing the protection of individual rights and majority rule, the Founding Fathers attempted to create a  federalist  system that would keep most of policymaking power reserved to states and localities. America s presidential election system also was designed to empower the states, not just the American people as an undifferentiated mass.The total number of electors and thus electoral votes across all states and the District of Columbia included after the passage of the 23rd Amendment adds up to 538. The winner must receive a majority, or 270, of these votes to become president.The system empowers states, especially smaller ones, because it incentivizes presidential candidates to appeal to places that may be far away from population centers. Farmers in Iowa may have very different concerns than bankers in New York. A more federalist system of electing presidents takes that into account.The states are free to select the method in which they choose their electors. In the early days of the republic, most states chose to have their legislatures pick electors, rather than the people. But, over time, the states shifted to choosing electors via the state s popular vote instead. Every state has opted for popular election at least since the Civil War.Calls to AbolishModern opponents of the Electoral College argue against what they call antidemocratic aspects of the institution, criticizing both the intermediary electors and the state-by-state system of voting.Calls to fundamentally change the Electoral College reached a peak after Republican George W. Bush defeated Democrat Al Gore in the tightly contested 2000 election. Gore narrowly won the national popular vote, and many of his supporters howled that the system even without the Supreme Court stepping in was unfair.One organization, National Popular Vote, has worked toward eliminating the Electoral College through an amendment to the Constitution or a state compact. National Popular Vote argues that the current system encourages presidential candidates to spend most of their time in  swing states  rather than campaigning for votes across the entire country.This plan for a national popular vote has received a moderate level of support, but Heritage s von Spakovsky has called it bad policy, based on mistaken assumptions. Swing states, he wrote,  can change from election to election, and many states that are today considered to be reliably  blue  or  red  in the presidential race were recently unpredictable. Many states have signed on to a bill that essentially would tie a state s electoral votes to the national popular vote. Those states will pledge to swing all of their electoral votes to the winner of the national vote.But this is because the incentives would be to appeal only to the biggest population centers. Swing states change over time, and the 2016 election could be a prime example of swing-state unpredictability and erosion of the traditional partisan political map.Additionally, if the president were elected by unfiltered national vote, small and rural states would become irrelevant, and campaigns would spend their time in large, populous districts.FINALLY ARE THE DEMOCRATS PROUD OF THIS DISGUSTING MAN WHO CURSES AND LIES?Read more: Daily Signal",politics,"Oct 26, 2017"

"BREAKING: BROTHER Of Las Vegas Massacre Suspect Has Been ARRESTED In California","By now, most of America has seen the crazy video of the Las Vegas mass shooter s brother Eric Paddock. Stephen Paddock s brother Eric, defended his brother, by arguing that he was wealthy and that somehow because he was generous to him and his mother, (which he bragged about ad nauseam) that people should consider looking at his brother in a different light.Watch this compilation of Stephen Paddock s brother Eric Paddock s strangest moments during the interview:The family of the alleged mass murderer Stephen Paddock is very interesting, to say the least. Stephen s father was listed on the FBI s  Most Wanted  list, and now, it appears, there s another alleged criminal in the Paddock family.A brother of Las Vegas mass shooter Stephen Paddock was arrested in Los Angeles on Wednesday on suspicion of possessing hundreds of images of child pornography, according to authorities.Bruce Douglas Paddock, 58, was taken into custody at a nursing facility in the 5300 block of Laurel Canyon Boulevard, in the Valley Village neighborhood, and booked at 8 a.m. Television news footage showed Paddock in a wheelchair being loaded into the back of a van by Los Angeles Police Department officers.Documents filed Tuesday in Los Angeles County Superior Court outlined 20 criminal charges against Paddock, all related to possession of child pornography or the sexual exploitation of children. The felony complaint for the arrest warrant accused Paddock of having more than 600 pornographic images of children or youths, including 10 or more images showing a child younger than 12.The investigation of Paddock began after evidence was found in a Sun Valley business where he had been squatting, the LAPD said in a statement. The evidence was found after Paddock was evicted, police said.Paddock was homeless at the time and couldn t be found, the LAPD said, adding that investigations  recently  tracked him to the North Hollywood facility where he was arrested Wednesday.The LAPD released a photo of Paddock  in case there may be victims of unreported incidents,  who might see it and contact authorities, the department said.Josh Rubenstein, an LAPD spokesman, said Paddock s arrest was the result of an independent investigation by the LAPD and not related to the deadly shooting rampage in Las Vegas. The LAPD s case began before the shooting, he added. There s no connection,  he said.On the night of Oct. 1, 64-year-old Stephen Paddock fired on the crowd at a country music festival from his hotel room in Las Vegas. Paddock killed 58 people in the meticulously planned attack and wounded hundreds more before he shot and killed himself. His motivation remains a mystery, authorities say.On Wednesday, Sandra Breault, a spokeswoman for the FBI in Las Vegas, declined to comment on Bruce Paddock s arrest.Bruce Paddock was apprehended at a nursing home that offers patients long- and short-term medical care. A spokeswoman for the facility confirmed the police activity occurred there, but declined to comment on Paddock, citing patient privacy laws.The suspect is one of four brothers. Their father, Benjamin Hoskins Paddock, was a convicted bank robber who was once placed on the FBI s Most Wanted list.Bruce Paddock has had numerous run-ins with local law enforcement over the last 25 years, according to Los Angeles County criminal records.

"MAD MAXINE Doubles Down On Threats Against Trump: His Supporters Are The KKK [Video]","U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters attacked President Trump about 27 seconds into her speech to  homeless LGBTQ youth  at the Ali Forney Center in New York City earlier this month.She began her speech with:  Wow, what a moving evening this is. I m sitting here listening, watching, absorbing, thinking about Ali even though I never met him. And with this kind of inspiration, I will go and take Trump out tonight,  she said, pumping her fist as the crowd roared with approval.On Monday, Waters offered no apologies for her promise to  take out  Trump during an interview with CNN s  New Day,  and instead doubled down on her commitment to impeach the president. Those words have been interpreted as an attempt on the president s life,  CNN s Chris Cuomo told Waters.  How did you intend them? That s absolutely ridiculous, nobody believes that,  Waters said.  A 79-year-old grandmother who is a congresswoman and who has been in Congress and politics for all these years talking about doing any harm. The only harm I may be doing to the president is I want him impeached,  Waters said.She alleged the folks who oppose her efforts to unseat the president, and the people who want her out of office, are racists. And those people who are so opposed to my leadership on impeachment are organizing the right wing, the white nationals, the KKK, they have organized an effort to try and, of course, defeat me in my election coming up and to discredit me,  Waters said. Everybody knows that I m on the front lines not talking about any physical harm to anybody, but I am talking about impeachment and I m not going to stop. She then went on to name all the reasons she hates Trump, though none of them include a legal justification for removing the president. I believe this president is not worthy,  she said.  I believe this president should not be representing our country. He has alienated our allies. He continues to lie, day in and day out. He creates controversy. He can t get along with the members of Congress. He needs to be impeached. I want him impeached. And I m going to continue my efforts to call for his impeachment. Cuomo pointed out that Waters  comments represent  ugly talk,  and questioned whether those who oppose Trump should  be the change that you want to see and have   a high level of decency in how you discuss those whom you want to criticize, especially when it s the president of the United States. Waters alleged she s been  extremely responsible in laying out the case for why this president should be impeached. The problem is racists, she said. I know that the right wing, the white nationalists, all of those who have organized around this president, do not like this. And people are not accustomed to a woman, in particular an African American woman, taking this kind of leadership,  she said.  How dare me challenge the president of the United States, but we have never witnessed a president who has been as irresponsible and as dangerous as this president. And I think that we need to step up to the plate and tell the truth and speak truth to power and that s what I m doing and that s what I m going to continue to do. Waters has used every platform available to her to continue her crusade against President Trump It s only making her look totally unhinged.",politics,"Oct 25, 2017"
"ABC NEWS REPORTS: Las Vegas Massacre Suspects Hard Drive Is MISSING From His Laptop","The investigation into the Las Vegas massacre Stephen Paddock just keeps getting more and more strange. Since the shooting massacre that took the lives of 59, and injured hundreds of others in Las Vegas at the Rt. 91 country music festival, we ve seen several timeline changes, a lockdown of the Las Vegas coroner s office, a very strange protection around the  security guard  at the Mandalay Bay Casino and Resort, including an armed guard and a scripted appearance on the Ellen Show. And now like some of the most well-known mass shooters before him, Stephen Paddock s hard drive is missing ?ABC News  A laptop computer recovered from the Las Vegas hotel room where Stephen Paddock launched the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history was missing its hard drive, depriving investigators of a potential key source of information on why he killed and maimed so many people, ABC News has learned.Paddock is believed to have removed the hard drive before fatally shooting himself, and the missing device has not yet been recovered, sources told ABC News.Investigators digging into Paddock s background also learned he purchased software designed to erase files from a hard drive, but without the hard drive to examine it is impossible to know if he ever used the software, one source said.The absence of substantial digital clues has left investigators struggling to piece together what triggered Paddock to kill 58 innocent concertgoers and injure more than 500 others on Oct. 1.Did Paddock remove the hard drive or is there something more to this story? Is there some connection to evidence being removed from laptops or cell phones from suspects of 3 of the most well-known mass shooting cases in America?According to ABC News (who dismisses this curious evidence as a casual coincidence):In 2007, Virginia Tech shooter Cho Seung Huiremoved the hard drive of his computer and disposed of his cell phone shortly before the massacre. Authorities even searched a pond for the missing digital media, but the devices were never recovered.The 2008 Northern Illinois shooter, Steven Kazmierczak, removed the SIM card from his phone and the hard drive from his laptop, and neither was recovered.In 2012, Sandy Hook shooter Adam Lanza had removed the hard drive from his computer and smashed it with a hammer or screwdriver.

"GUESS WHOS TRYING To Tie Amnesty For Nearly 800,000 ILLEGALS To End-of-Year Spending Deal? TWO HINTS: Its Not A Democrat and He Has A Huge Wall Around His Home","Hey, Paul do you hear that huge sucking sound? That s the sound of arrogant elected officials sprinting from Washington DC, like US Senators Jeff Flake (R-AZ) and Bob Corker (R-TN), as they watch polling numbers confirm their worst fears that they have no chance of being re-elected.  Americans are no longer willing to wait around for you to do the right thing.  We re holding every member of Congress accountable. If you re not working in the best interests of America and the American worker, you ll be drained from the swamp Breitbart   House Speaker Paul Ryan s closed-door announcement of slipping amnesty for nearly 800,000 illegal aliens covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program into an end-of-the-year spending deal comes less than a month after a DACA recipient has been accused of murder.Ryan, according to members of the Republican Study Committee (RSC), is planning to put together a spending deal that includes giving amnesty to the DACA illegal aliens, as Breitbart News reported. He did talk about the fact that that would be good if we could get ahead of that as opposed to being reactionary,  RSC Chairman Mark Walker (R-NC) told the HuffPost following the meeting with Ryan.Two House Republicans confirmed to the HuffPost that Ryan mentioned at the gathering slipping DACA amnesty into the spending deal.Ryan s leaking of a secret plan to attach amnesty to a spending bill comes less than a month after Breitbart News confirmed that a DACA recipient allegedly murdered a high school student in South Carolina.Voters need to ask Ryan why he s so determined to allow nearly 800,000 illegal aliens who are protected by DACA, many of whom were not children when they illegally crossed our borders, and are in fact, members of  violent gangs like MS-13, or who have a criminal history in the U.S. but are protected by sanctuary cities or counties. Paul Ryan has a huge wall around his personal residence in Wisconsin however, to keep the  bad hombres  out.As Breitbart News s photographic documentation reveals, Ryan s home is surrounded by a tall border fence reinforced by equally high bushes  ensuring both privacy and security. Moreover, the fence is manned by an on-duty agent who guards his property s perimeter. Upon even the slightest appearance of any unusual activity  such as a 5 2  female taking a photograph of the fence  Ryan s border agent will deploy into action to ensure the perimeter s sovereignty.Daniel De Jesus Rangel Sherrer, 19, was one of the nearly 800,000 illegal aliens shielded from deportation and given a work permit under DACA, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) confirmed to Breitbart Texas.Sherrer was charged in connection with the murder of 18-year-old Diana Martinez-Gonzalez, who was found shot to death in a wooded area in the town of Easley, South Carolina.Sherrer is now facing first-degree murder charges, and if he is released from prison at any time, he will be deported.Last week it was also reported that a 5-time deported, illegal alien, Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, was arrested on suspicion of intentionally starting the wildfires that ravaged through Sonoma County.

"TV EXECUTIVES In Discussion About CANCELLING Thursday Night NFL Games","Capitalism at work. It s funny how the loss of real money has a way of helping to remind NFL owners and the networks who support them, who are writing the checks. One hint it s not the guys disrespecting our flag.Network executives are scrambling to solve the growing problem of crashing ratings for the National Football League, by cutting games to end the perceived  over-saturation  of football on TV.To put an end to the sliding ratings, the executives are proposing that fewer games may be the ticket to stop that  over-saturation,  with one idea being to cut Thursday Night Football by a whopping ten games.The idea to trim Thursday Night Football from 18 games a season to only eight was first reported by Sports Business Journal and was part of a plan to reverse the ratings crash that also includes pulling games played in the U.K. back to 1 PM eastern time (6PM London time).Indeed the amount of football on TV has exploded in the last decade.Ratings are still down despite the small rise seen in Week 7. NBC Sports is off 21 percent from 2015, CBS Sports is down 14 percent compared to 2015, and ESPN s Monday Night Football has sunk 17 percent over 2015. -BreitbartRasmussen reports that nearly one-third (32 percent) of adults say they re less likely to watch NFL game telecasts because of the Kaepernick-led player protests against racial injustice. The telephone/online survey of 1,000 American adults was conducted Oct. 2-3.This letter from a die-hard Pittsburg Steelers fan hits the nail on the head, as it relates to how NFL fans feel about the players who continue to disrespect our flag: I want to thank you for freeing up my Sundays. Some of the earliest memories of my life are watching Steelers games with my dad. I was once a season-ticket holder. I have occasionally missed a few games on TV through the years due to scheduling conflicts, but I can honestly say in my 44 years of living, I have never intentionally turned off a Steelers game. That changed today. As I sat down to watch the Steelers-Bears game today, I learned from the sideline reporter that the Steelers chose not to participate in the national anthem. I realize that there is a lot of injustice in our country. I realize that there are a lot of people upset at the current administration. I realize that we live in a free country where people have the freedom to not participate in the national anthem. I also have the freedom to not spend another minute or dollar on your product. I am of the opinion that this is quite possibly the worst way to go about  protesting.  If you want to hold a rally at Heinz Field to allow your players to voice their opinions, that would be fine. If you want all the Steelers and NFL players to march on Washington D.C., fine. But to not participate in the national anthem is an insult to every serviceman who has served or has passed away defending this country. If you are truly that unhappy with the country, feel free to play for the CFL. So thank you, Steelers and NFL, for freeing up my Sundays. I will no longer waste my time or money watching your product. The weather today the in Pittsburgh area is beautiful and I can not think of a better day to spend it outside, away from the TV.

"DRAIN THE SWAMP! Republicans NOT Running for Re-election in 2018","One thing President Trump has been able to do while in office is expose the politicians who are not true conservatives and who aren t supporting his policies. Politicians like Jeff Flake fought Trump on immigration and border security every step of the way. The voters agreed with Trump so Flake was heading for defeat in Arizona by a large margin. Instead of announcing his decision to not seek reelection quietly, Flake chose to grandstand and bash President Trump in what can only be described as a sour grapes hate-fest. Below is a list of  centrist  and left-leaning  Republicans In Name Only  who are not seeking reelection:MAYBE THEY CAN RUN AS DEMOCRATS NEXT TIMEThe 2018 midterm elections on Tuesday, Nov. 6, will give President Trump his first chance to defend the Republican Party s Senate and House majorities. Already, however, several Republicans in Congress have announced they won t be running for re-election. Here s our running list:Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn.After tangling with President Trump, including questioning his  stability  and  competence,  Corker put an end to speculation and announced he would not be running again in 2018. Corker and Trump have since engaged in multiple scraps on Twitter, Corker calling it  a shame the White House has become an adult day care center  and Trump saying Corker  couldn t get elected dog catcher. Rep. Charlie Dent, R-Pa.Dent, a centrist Republican, announced in September that he d decided against running for re-election after consulting with family and advisers. Pennsylvania state Rep. Justin Simmons had announced he would challenge Dent in the primary. Rep. John Duncan, R-Tenn.Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz.Flake confirmed his decision in a Senate floor speech in October and condemned the current state of politics, specifically President Trump, as one of the main reasons he s deciding to step aside. Related: Republicans fear  flood  of centrist retirements ahead of 2018 electionsLynn Jenkins, R-KansasRep. Sam Johnson, R-TexasRep. Tim Murphy, R-Pa.Publicly pro-life, Murphy said he would not be running for re-election in 2018 after it was revealed that he had asked his mistress to have an abortion.Rep. Dave Reichert, R-Wash.Reichert faced tense townhall crowds during the August recess, and announced upon returning in September that he had decided  this will be my last term.  A number of Democrats were already preparing to try to challenge him. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee celebrated afterward that  clearly, Congressman Reichert saw the writing on the wall.  Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla.Cuban-American and the first Hispanic woman elected to Congress, Ros-Lehtinen announced back in April 2017 that she will retire at the end of her current term.

Could it be Senator John McCain, the petty and spiteful sworn emeny of Donald Trump? What about his admission in January 2017, that he was the one who passed along the dossier of claims of a Russian blackmail plot against the president-elect? McCain called it doing  what any citizen should do .McCain   a longstanding anti-Trump Republican who had disassociated himself from the candidate s campaign weeks before the election   cast himself as an innocent and concerned member of the public as he justified his move.He claimed he had no idea whether it was accurate or not   but that he believed the FBI should have it because it was  sensitive . I did what any citizen should do. I received sensitive information and handed it to the FBI,  he told CNN   the network which broke the story that the document existed. It was then published in full by Buzzfeed. The Arizona senator issued a public statement amid mounting questions of his exact role in the affair   and how a document riddled with errors and unverifiable claims came to be published. Late last year, I received sensitive information that has since been made public,  he said. Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the Director of the FBI. That has been the extent of my contact with the FBI or any other government agency regarding this issue.

Democrats have also protected the company.The revelation that the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee were involved in procuring the salacious accusations against Trump that fed their own later accusations of Russian interference in the election lends credence to those who, like Trump himself, have regarded the Russia accusations as conspiracy theories.

In August of this year, Sanders responded to comments against President Trump by Corker: White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders ripped Republican Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker s questioning of Trump s  stability  and  competence  on Thursday, calling Corker s claim  ridiculous and outrageous. Corker, who has been one of the more supportive voices of Trump in the Senate, raised questions about Trump s competence last week in the wake of the president s comments on the violence in Charlottesville. He recently has not demonstrated that he understands the character of our nation   what has made it great and what it is today. He s got to demonstrate the characteristics of a president who understands that. Without those things happening, our nation is going to go through great peril,  Corker said of Trump. The president has not yet been able to demonstrate the stability, nor some of the competence, that he needs to demonstrate in order for him to be successful   and our nation and our world needs for him to be successful, whether you are Republican or Democrat,  Corker added.Asked about Corker s claim at the White House press briefing, Sanders kept her answer brief.

"RINO SENATOR FLAKE Trashes Trump and Republican Party On Way Out [Video]","The swamp is draining One more RINO is not running for reelection. Senator Jeff Flake announced he will not run again today in a vindictive speech against President Trump and Republicans. Hey, the guy was even thinking of running as an Independent what does that tell you? He s NOT a conservative! He mentioned in his speech that he couldn t support Trump s policies on trade and immigration. Well, those two policies are what got Trump elected!FLAKE WAS 26 POINTS DOWN IN THE POLLS:The bombshell, which Flake, R-Ariz., detailed Tuesday afternoon on the Senate floor, will further roil Republican hopes of keeping the party s 52-seat Senate majority in the midterm elections of Trump s first term, when the president s party historically loses seats in Congress.It also likely will upend the race for Flake s seat.Flake, one of the Senate s more prominent critics of President Donald Trump, has been struggling in the polls.A GRANDSTANDING AND VINDICTIVE SPEECH:He told The Arizona Republic ahead of his announcement that he has become convinced  there may not be a place for a Republican like me in the current Republican climate or the current Republican Party. Flake said he has not  soured on the Senate  and loves the institution, but that as a traditional, libertarian-leaning conservative Republican he is out of step with today s Trump-dominated GOP. This spell will pass, but not by next year,  Flake said.Among Republican primary voters, there s overwhelming support for Trump s positions and  behavior,  Flake said, and one of their top concerns is whether a candidate is with the president or against him. While Flake said he is with Trump on some issues, on other issues he is not. And Trump definitely views him as a foe, having denounced Flake publicly and called him  toxic  on Twitter. Here s the bottom line: The path that I would have to travel to get the Republican nomination is a path I m not willing to take, and that I can t in good conscience take,  Flake told The Republic in a telephone interview.  It would require me to believe in positions I don t hold on such issues as trade and immigration and it would require me to condone behavior that I cannot condone.

He also said he has  no intention  of making a presidential run.SENATE RACE HEATS UP:Kelli Ward, the former state senator from Lake Havasu City who lost her primary challenge last year against Sen. John McCain, has emerged this year as the top GOP alternative to Flake, but other names have been mentioned as possibilities: Arizona State Treasurer Jeff DeWit, former Arizona Republican Party Chairman Robert Graham and Arizona Board of Regents member Jay Heiler. Lesser-known Republicans Craig Brittain and Nicholas Tutora also have filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission and are running.But Flake s exit is sure to prompt bigger Arizona Republican names to take a fresh look at the GOP Senate race.Steve Bannon, Trump s controversial former White House strategist, has embraced Ward as part of his national  open revolt  against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and the GOP establishment. But other Republicans have warned that Ward is a weak candidate whose nomination would jeopardize GOP chances of holding Arizona s Senate seat.The winner of the Aug. 28 Republican primary could face Rep.

PRESIDENT TRUMPS National Park Service CANCELS Taxpayer Funding For Project Honoring Violent Black Panthers Group That Killed Park Ranger","Beyonce made an attempt to glorify the violent Black Panther s group during her NFL Superbowl halftime show in 2015. Former President Barack Obama once marched with the New Black Panthers while campaigning for president in Selma, AL in March, 2007. The photographs, captured from a Flickr photo-sharing account before it was scrubbed, are the latest evidence of the mainstream media s failure to examine Obama s extremist ties and radical roots.The National Park Service told the Washington Free Beacon it is no longer providing funding for a controversial project  honoring the legacy  of the Black Panther Party after outrage that the agency would spend taxpayer dollars to memorialize a group that murdered a park ranger in the 1970s.The Free Beacon revealed last month that the Park Service gave roughly $100,000 to the University of California, Berkeley for a research project on the Marxist extremist group to  memorialize a history that brought meaning to lives far beyond the San Francisco Bay Area. A captain in the Black Panther Party murdered National Park Service ranger Kenneth Patrick while he was on patrol near San Francisco in 1973. Patrick was shot three times by Veronza Leon Curtis Bowers Jr., who is currently serving a life sentence for first-degree murder. Patrick left behind a widow and three children.The Fraternal Order of Police, the largest organization of sworn law enforcement officers with over 330,000 members, sent a letter to President Donald Trump last week expressing  outrage and shock  that the National Park Service would fund a project honoring the legacy of the Black Panther Party. Mr. President, as far as we are concerned the only meaning they brought to any lives was grief to the families of their victims,  wrote Chuck Canterbury, the national president of the Fraternal Order of Police.  According to our research, members of this militant anti-American group murdered 16 law enforcement officers over the course of their history. Among their victims was U.S. Park Ranger Kenneth C. Patrick. He was murdered in cold blood by three members of the Black Panther Party on 5 August 1973. His killer, who remains behind bars, still considers himself a Black Panther and a  political prisoner.' It is appalling that the National Park Service, Ranger Patrick s own agency, now proposes to partner with [Berkeley] and two active members of this violent and repugnant organization,  Canterbury said.The FBI labels the Black Panther Party as advocates for  the use of violence and guerilla tactics to overthrow the U.S. government. At a time when many in our nation feel strongly that memorials to aspects of the darker times in our history be removed from public lands, why would the NPS seek to commemorate the activities of an extremist separatist group that advocated the use of violence against our country a country they perceived as their enemy?  Canterbury asked.  This is a despicable irony and we hope you can bring it to an end by halting [the grant] immediately. ",politics,"Oct 24, 2017"

In an effort to try to make herself relevant and in what seems like a desperate attempt to address her irrelevancy, Warren appears to have made up a sick story of sexual harassment at the hands of a law professor at Harvard University.After her account about what happened with the now deceased Harvard law professor on Meet the Press, the Boston Herald called out the senator, who has a history of lying. In 1997, Elizabeth Warren was listed as the Harvard Law s  first woman of color  in a law review piece on diversity and affirmative action.Elizabeth Warren pushed back hard on questions about a Harvard Crimson piece in 1996 that described her as Native American, saying she had no idea the school where she taught law was billing her that way and saying it never came up during her hiring a year earlier, which others have backed up.But a 1997 Fordham Law Review piece described her as Harvard Law School s  first woman of color,  based, according to the notes at the bottom of the story, on a  telephone interview with Michael Chmura, News Director, Harvard Law (Aug. 6, 1996). GPThe Boston Herald set the record straight about Warren s  new  account of  events with the now deceased law professor:U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren reportedly switched up her account of sexual harassment that she relayed this weekend in a televised #MeToo testimonial from an earlier  light-hearted  version .But the Boston Globe reported last night that Warren recounted the same incident in a  more light-hearted manner  at a memorial service after the professor s death in 1997   an account the Globe noted was  inconsistent  with her story on Sunday. During the service after his death in 1997, Warren spoke fondly of law professor Eugene Smith and told the gathered mourners she was laughing as Smith chased her around his desk, according to a colleague s memoir,  the Globe reported.The author of the memoir, John Mixon, told the paper,  I may have been wrong saying she was laughing,  adding that he was writing about the service 15 years after the fact.The paper also noted that Warren failed to mention on  Meet The Press  that Smith had polio.The Globe said Warren told the broadsheet yesterday she shared the story at the memorial service as a statement about Smith s authority. It was 20 years later, and he didn t have power over me any more,  Warren told the newspaper, which noted she was by then a Harvard law professor.",politics,"Oct 24, 2017"

The Justice Department has reportedly threatened to prosecute the informant if he discloses details of his involvement in the investigation. The Executive Branch does not have the authority to use non-disclosure agreements to avoid Congressional scrutiny. If the FBI is allowed to contract itself out of Congressional oversight, it would seriously undermine our Constitutional system of checks and balances. The Justice Department needs to work with the Committee to ensure that witnesses are free to speak without fear, intimidation or retaliation from law enforcement.

He seems to have this tendency to talk down to people of color, to treat them with disrespect, and I think this adds to it,  Waters said.  First of all, he called [Wilson] wacky. Secondly, that he didn t back down, that he simply talked about her in a way that was not respectful I think that yes, I think this adds to the suspicion of him and the way that he thinks about minorities and black people in particular. She said Kelly was also wrong in her criticism of Wilson s 2015 speech, and she said she had the backing of the Congressional Black Caucus in saying the Trump Administration needs to do more to respect black women. All of the women of the Congressional Black Caucus have come together and we re demanding an apology,  she said.  We re sick and tired of women being undermined, dismissed, and black women, in particular, being called names. Waters also criticized Trump s overall leadership. He has the most distorted leadership of any president I ve ever known or heard about,  Waters said.  Here he had the opportunity to make the condolence call, to do it properly, to recognize this family and their grieving, and also to know the name of the soldier who had been killed. It is so unconscionable in the way that he manages his leadership,  she added.Waters also said Kelly s credibility has been damaged. General Kelly has had a good career, and to have his career basically undermined by the president of the United States because he s trying to protect the president and stand up for the president when the president did not deserve to be stood up for, now he s damaged himself,  Waters said.

"BILL OREILLY EMBARRASSES Megyn Kelly&Publishes Letters She Wrote Thanking Him For Being A Dear Friend and For Years of Support After She Bashed Him On Her Flailing NBC Morning Show [VIDEO]","Megyn Kelly is quite possibly the least popular host on television. She s also quite possibly one of the highest paid hosts on one of the lowest rated morning shows on television. In her desperate attempt to do just about anything for ratings, the very unlikeable host went after Fox News and the former top-rated host Bill O Reilly. Was Kelly s on-air letter an attempt to jump on Hollywood s anti-sexual harassment bandwagon? Was she hoping to endear herself to a more left-leaning audience, since she clearly has no hope of ever regaining the conservative fans she lost when she attacked then-candidate Trump during a FOX News hosted GOP primary presidential debate? The NBC News host made the reveal before welcoming former Fox News host and O Reilly accuser Juliet Huddy onto her Monday talk show.Former Fox News host Juliet Huddy spoke out for the first time about her accusations against Bill O Reilly and what women face when going up against a corporation on Monday s Megyn Kelly Today.During an opening segment about this weekend s report of new sexual harassment revelations against O Reilly, former Fox News host Kelly revealed that she, too, had complained about O Reilly s behavior. She said she understands the roadblocks women see when speaking out about sexual harassment, something an emotional Huddy explained as  You are just this one person about to go up against a machine. It s daunting and frightening and it holds you back from taking action sometimes. Earlier this year, the New York Times reported that Huddy said O Reilly pursued a sexual relationship with her in 2011 and that when she rebuffed his advances he tried to derail her career. Allegations included O Reilly calling Huddy repeatedly, sometimes sounding as if he were masturbating, and after asking her to return a key to his hotel room, he appeared at the door in his boxer shorts. In exchange for her agreement not to sue, she was paid a sum in the high six figures, though 21st Century Fox and O Reilly said her allegations were false.To open the show, Kelly made public for the first time a letter (below) she wrote to the co-presidents of Fox News about O Reilly, displaying the note she sent to Bill Shine and Jack Abernethy during the top of her show while discussing this weekend s Times report about a new sexual harassment settlement made by O Reilly. Fox News was not exactly a friendly environment for harassment victims who wanted to report, in my experience,  Kelly said.  However, O Reilly s suggestion that no one ever complained about his behavior is false. I know because I complained. Not so fast Megyn Bill O Reilly immediately revealed 2 handwritten letters from Megyn Kelly where she gushed all over him and how much she appreciated him on his website:My former FNC colleagues Megyn Kelly & Gretchen Carlson wrote me notes when we worked together. You can read them on https://t.co/rryWmyXe7C  Bill O'Reilly (@BillOReilly) October 23, 2017Here are Kelly s letters to O Reilly: O Reilly even took it a step further and released a letter from sexual harassment accuser and former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson:Here is Carlson s letter to O Reilly:Bill  Thank you for being the calm in the sea.Thank you so much for supporting me.Thank you for being my friend.It means the world to meGC[Gretchen Carlson]Megyn immediately got hammered on Twitter after O Reilly released her letters to him.

"WORLDS MOST POPULAR Search Engine Places FICTIONAL Story At Top Of News Feed:Melania Trump is Lonely, Racist and Obsessed With Michelle Obama","Google is the search engine the majority of people in the world go if they need to look up something. In fact, it is estimated that over 30 BILLION searches are performed on Google every month. Google now has a special feature for mobile users. When you go to search for a topic on Google, a news feed appears under the search bar, with what users expect to be the most popular current stories. But are they the most popular stories, or are they simply Google s contribution to the leftist propaganda machine? With all of the news breaking about Hillary s Uranium One deal with Russia, surely readers wouldn t expect to find some fictional story about Melania being a  racist ,  as the top story on Google s mobile newsfeed or would they?    Here s the story that appeared at the top of Google s news feed today:Newsweek: Melania Trump is lonely and obsessed with Michelle Obama. At least in Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie s version of events anyway.The Nigerian author has penned a short story for the The New York Times  style magazine, T, which paints the first lady referred to throughout only as  Mrs T as the reluctant wife of the president who displays an unease with her political fame. And she s a little bit racist, too.Adichie s  micronovel,  Janelle Asked to the Bedroom, envisions a conversation between a forlorn Trump and her pilates instructor Janelle. The story was published on the Times website and on the T magazine Instagram page.In the short story, Janelle is unusually called to join Mrs T in her bedroom, rather than her home gym, and is surprised to find the first lady looking  disheveled, her manner distracted. Adichie s fictional account also portrays Trump as envious of her predecessor s natural ease in the role of first lady. Mrs T shows Janelle a video she s been watching on YouTube of Michelle Obama visiting a classroom. She also reveals a folder full of pictures of Obama on her laptop.  Look at this. I always look at them for the inspiration,  she says.In this fictional world, Mrs T s only source of joy comes from her 11-year-old son, Barron. The first lady perks up speaking to her son, who is described as  sweetly shy and polite, dependent on his mother for his sense of self. But Adichie s imagined Trump also exhibits a casual racism that her husband, President Donald Trump, is often accused of sharing.Mrs T makes a prejudicial remark when Janelle informs her that her son has been accepted to Harvard University.  He got scholarship to go?  she asks.  How automatic, this assumption of a scholarship, and Janelle knew she meant a scholarship not of smarts but of skin,  writes Adichie.Janelle Asked to the Bedroom follows an earlier, pre-election short story by Adichie, The Arrangements, also written for the Times.In that story, published in June 2016, Trump quietly doubts her husband s chances of winning the presidency. It also depicts a strained relationship between her and Donald Trump s children from previous marriages, particularly Ivanka Trump, whose close relationship with her husband she envies.Why would Google choose to put that ridiculous story of pure fiction about Melania, that claims she s a  racist  at the top of their newsfeed? Who, at Google is in charge of deciding which  news  stories will appear at the top of the feed? Let s take a look at the next two stories, following the fictional Melania smear story:The next most popular story on Google s  news  feed was about Hillary. The story wasn t about what is likely the biggest political scandal in American history, as a massive coverup that involves former Sec of State Hillary Clinton, Rober Mueller, Jim Comey, Barack Obama, Rod Rosenstein, Andrew McCabe and Bill Clinton, it was instead, about how the spies that Hillary helped to send back to Russia after the FBI caught them, were coming ever closer to her, while they were here in the U.S. spying. The next most popular story on Google s newsfeed was about the media s obsession with Rex Tillerson abandoning his post as Trump s Sec of State. Even though Tillerson has denied those claims, Google s third story in their line up was about who Tillerson s replacement will be:So, where s a reader to go when they re just looking for a list of top stories without the propaganda?

"ILLEGAL ALIENS Jump Over Border Fence as MSNBC Reports On Border Wall Construction [Video]","Oh the irony! Left-leaning MSNBC aired a segment about President Trump s proposed border wall, which ultimately proved the U.S.-Mexico border needs a bigger wall.HOW HIGH SHOULD WE GO? The Trump administration has approved the construction of eight prototypes of the border wall. These prototypes are nearing completion as the administration s deadline approaches. The prototypes have several guidelines they must satisfy. For instance, concrete walls have to be 30 ft. tall while walls made from alternate materials have to be 18 to 30 ft. tall.JUMPING THE FENCE MSNBC reporter Jacob Soboroff went to preview the prototypes that are being built between two existing border fences along the U.S.-Mexico border. During the segment, Soboroff was interviewing border patrol agent Roy Villareal when several migrants were caught on camera jumping the existing fence into the United States.EVERYDAY BORDER ENFORCEMENT = OPEN BORDERS  A small group of three people just jumped over in the middle of the day,  Soboroff noted.  So can you explain to me what s going on? This is the reality of everyday border enforcement. The United States is the draw for people with dire situations where they are at,  Villareal said.  We are going to continue to witness this. It plays out on a regular basis for us. Soboroff went to the Mexican side of the border and showed how easy it was to cross the border under current conditions.THIS IS OUTRAGEOUS! Can you imagine how easy it s been for terrorists to cross?We just reported on a terrorist who made his way to Canada via Mexico and the U.S.: The Democrats are fighting against closing our border with Mexico at every step of the way. They want open borders It s that simple. If you vote for Democrats then you re voting for open borders. They have zero interest in stopping the flow of illegals to America. One of the key things to remember about open borders is it s not just the people from Mexico looking for a job or better life. The truth is that our open border has become a GLOBAL MAGNET for people from all over the world to come for many different reasons. One of the reasons is terrorism The case below highlights the desperate need for border control if we want to stop the flow of terrorists to America and Canada:The Somali terrorist who stabbed a Canadian police officer and ran over four pedestrians a few weeks ago entered the United States through the Mexican border and was released by Obama s Department of Homeland Security (DHS), allowing him to continue his journey north. The ISIS operative, Abdulahi Hasan Sharif, was ordered deported, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spokeswoman told various media outlets recently, but was released on an  order of supervision  and the feds never saw him again.Sharif entered the U.S. in 2011 through the San Ysidro port of entry in California without documentation and was briefly held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego, a local newspaper reported. A year later he crossed the border into Canada and settled in Edmonton after being granted refugee status. On September 30 he slammed into an Edmonton police officer with his car then got out of the vehicle and repeatedly stabbed the cop with a knife. After fleeing the scene, Sharif stole a truck and deliberately mowed down four pedestrians. Canadian authorities found an ISIS flag in his car and have charged him with multiple counts of attempted murder, criminal flight causing bodily harm and possession of a weapon. Two years ago, Canadian authorities investigated the 30-year-old terrorist for espousing extremist views. It s disturbing that Sharif s northbound trek took him through the U.S.-Mexico border.As part of an ongoing investigation into cartels, corruption and terrorism, Judicial Watch has for years reported that Islamic extremists are entering the country through Mexico and that ISIS is operating in border towns just miles from American cities. Judicial Watch launched the project in 2014 by exposing a sophisticated narco-terror ring with strong ties to ISIS and connections running from El Paso to Chicago to New York City. Two of the FBI s most wanted were embroiled in the operation that also had deep ties to Mexico. Less than a year later, Judicial Watch reported that ISIS is operating in a Mexican border town just eight miles from El Paso, the result of Islamic terrorists joining forces with drug cartels and human smugglers knowns as  coyotes. When Judicial Watch reported that Mexican cartels were smuggling foreigners from countries with terrorist links into a small Texas rural town, federal authorities publicly denied the story was true. Never the less, high-level sources on both sides of the border confirmed to Judicial Watch that foreigners, classified as Special Interest Aliens (SIA), were being transported to stash areas in Acala, a rural crossroads located around 54 miles from El Paso on a state road   Highway 20. Once in the U.S., the SIAs waited for pick-up in the area s sand hills just across Highway 20. At the time a Texas Department of Public Safety report leaked by the media had already confirmed that for years members of known Islamist terrorist organizations had been apprehended crossing the southern border.Last year a high-ranking DHS official told Judicial Watch that Mexican drug traffickers help Islamic terrorists stationed in Mexico cross into the United States to explore targets for future attacks. Among the jihadists that travel back and forth through the porous southern border is a Kuwaiti named Shaykh Mahmood Omar Khabir, an ISIS operative who lives in the Mexican state of Chihuahua not far from El Paso. Khabir trained hundreds of Al Qaeda fighters in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Yemen and has lived in Mexico for more than a year, according to information provided by Judicial Watch s government source. Now Khabir trains thousands of men mostly Syrians and Yemenis to fight in an ISIS base situated in the Mexico-U.S. border region near Ciudad Ju rez, the intelligence gathered by Judicial Watch s source reveals. Staking out U.S. targets is not difficult and Khabir actually bragged in an Italian newspaper article that the border region is so open that he  could get in with a handful of men, and kill thousands of people in Texas or in Arizona in the space of a few hours.  In the same article Mexico s top diplomat, Foreign Affairs Secretary Claudia Ruiz, said  this new wave of fundamentalism could have nasty surprises in store for the United States. While much of the American mainstream media ignores that Sharif made it to Canada via the U.S.-Mexico border, it s hardly surprising considering Islamic extremists have been infiltrating the country through the famously unprotected region for years. Referring to the recent Canadian attack, a think-tank dedicated to investigating the operations, funding, activities and front groups of Islamic extremists worldwide writes:  Fears about a terrorist using the U.S.-Mexican border as a gateway for an attack have been realized.

"ESPNS JEMELE HILL Makes Shocking Admission About Her Suspension for Calling Trump A White Supremacist","ESPN anchor Jemele Hill says she deserved to be suspended for getting too political on Twitter (please see our previous report below).

"YOU CANT MAKE THIS UP: Special Counsel Leading Trump-Russia Collusion Investigation Is Person Who Gave Russians Uranium Under Direction Of Crooked Hillary","You seriously can t make this stuff up Wouldn t it be great if we had a real and honest media, and this was the top story of the day today?Zero Hedge   Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton facilitated the transfer a highly enriched uranium (HEU) previously confiscated by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) during a 2006  nuclear smuggling sting operation involving one Russian national and several Georgian accomplices,  a newly leaked classified cable shows.So-called  background  information was provided in the cable which gave vague details on a 2006 nuclear smuggling sting operation in which the U.S. government took possession of some HEU previously owned by the Russians. Over two years ago Russia requested a ten-gram sample of highly enriched uranium (HEU) seized in early 2006 in Georgia during a nuclear smuggling sting operation involving one Russian national and several Georgian accomplices. The seized HEU was transferred to U.S. custody and is being held at a secure DOE facility. The secret  action request,  dated Aug. 17, 2009, was sent out by Secretary of State Clinton and was addressed to the United States Ambassador to Georgia Embassy Tbilisi, the Russian Embassy, and Ambassador John Beyrle.It proposed that FBI Director Robert Mueller be the one that personally conducts the transfer a 10-gram sample of HEU to Russian law enforcement sources during a secret  plane-side  meeting on a  tarmac  in the early fall of 2009. We require that the transfer of this material be conducted at the airport, on the tarmac near by the plane, upon arrival of the Director s aircraft. Gateway Pundit    The cable also states that  Given Russia s reluctance to act so far, FBI Mueller s delivery of this sample will underscore to Russia our commitment to follow through on this case.  It continues in stating,  Embassy Moscow is requested to alert at the highest appropriate level the Russian Federation that FBI Director Mueller plans to deliver the HEU sample once he arrives to Moscow on September 21. The cable summarizes that,  We regret that the April visit by Director Mueller could not take place due to a scheduling conflict.  and makes a final request that,  We require that the transfer of this material be conducted at the airport, on the tarmac near by the plane, upon arrival of the Director s aircraft. Now knowing that the Obama Administration and Hillary Clinton hid the FBI investigation into the Uranium One deal, this cable brings on new meaning and leads to numerous questions.Why did Obama and Clinton agree to provide this uranium delivered by Mueller to Russia in the first place?An article by the Atlantic from April 2008 tells the fascinating story of the smuggler in the country of Georgia who was arrested trying to sell uranium to potential buyers. The smuggler, Oleg Vladimirovich Khintsagov, on January 31, 2006, was apprehended by authorities carrying 100 grams of highly enriched uranium tucked into a plastic bag in his tattered leather coat.A sample of the uranium captured during this sting operation was provided to the Russians who analyzed it and determined that it was indeed highly enriched uranium (HEU). In the Atlantic article, it states that the Russians at first didn t respond to requests from Georgia on the uranium and at no time asked for the uranium back. As a matter of fact, the Russians worked hard to deny that the uranium came from Russia in the first place. So why did the Obama Administration hand deliver 10 grams of HEU to Russia in 2009 and when did Russia begin asking for another sample of the uranium and why did the memo not mention that the Russians had already obtained a sample of this uranium and determined that it was HEU?Another question is why did Clinton s Secretary of State request that FBI Director Mueller deliver the sample of HEU to Russia and why was the transfer in April canceled and postponed to September?Of all people, why would the Head of the FBI be selected to transfer uranium to Russia? It would seem that the US has a number of individuals who could perform this transfer and it would seem that FBI Director Mueller would have enough on his plate in the US. When Mueller couldn t make the transfer in April the transfer was postponed to September so Mueller could be there.The fact that Mueller needed to perform the transfer should raise numerous red flags. It s been widely reported about Mueller s conflicts of interest with his recent appointment as special counsel in the Russia investigation.According to The Hill, before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.They also obtained an eyewitness account   backed by documents   indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.The racketeering scheme was conducted  with the consent of higher level officials  in Russia who  shared the proceeds  from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.Rather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefitting Putin s commercial nuclear ambitions.Then-Attorney General Eric Holder was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time the Uranium One deal was approved. Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn t comment.Mikerin was a director of Rosatom s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom s new American arm called Tenam.Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin  did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons   to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,  a November 2014 indictment stated.His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show. For entire story: The HillThe investigation was ultimately supervised by then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, an Obama appointee who now serves as President Trump s deputy attorney general, and then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe, now the deputy FBI director under Trump, Justice Department documents show.On August 6, 2017, The Washington Times questioned Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein s  fishing expedition  aimed at digging up dirt on President Trump in his investigation in the Trump-Russia investigation. The special counsel is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Justice, and we don t engage in fishing expeditions,  Mr. Rosenstein said on  Fox News Sunday. In his first Sunday show interview, Mr. Rosenstein added that special counsel Robert Mueller  understands and I understand the specific scope of the investigation and so, it s not a fishing expedition. Mr. Rosenstein s comments come amid reports citing unnamed sources that the investigation has expanded into Mr. Trump s finances unrelated to possible Russian interference in last year s election.Mr. Rosenstein played down the reports:  That s not anything that I ve said. That s not anything Director Mueller has said. We don t know who s saying it or how credible those sources are.  Both men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible, but still unproven collusion between Russia and Donald Trump s campaign during the 2016 election. ",politics,"Oct 22, 2017"

Then Reid asked: If the Democrats were to retake the House, do you foresee a challenge to your leadership? Pelosi disagreed and defended her continued leadership:  With all due respect, I disagree with your characterization. I have overwhelming support of my caucus. There are some people there who disagree with me, and that s OK, but I would not say that it s a challenge from the left, because I am on the left. It gets better she takes a swipe at any challengers to her leadership by saying it s about others   ambition Yikes! She s not going down without a fight!Several Democrats have called for Pelosi to step down and MSNBC called the situation an  ugly divide  in the party.We think her time has come and gone but we re with President Trump KEEP HER! SHE S GREAT FOR THE GOP!HERE S ANOTHER RECENT MENTION TO PELOSI ABOUT STEPPING DOWN: WOW! Nancy Pelosi can t keep a train of thought going for more than a few seconds. She stumbles over her own words and can t remember what she just said. She gets really irritated with Meghan McCain who pointed out there s a divide in the Democrat Party. She claims that,  This is our turn! SHE S BANANAS!MEGHAN MCCAIN, CO-HOST  THE VIEW : There s a fracture in your party, like mine. There were people like Tim Ryan that were calling you to step down and asking for new blood. I don t think it s gender, look at the Bernie supporters versus Hillary supporters.PELOSI: Let me, with all due respect, disagree with you. There is not a fracture in our party similar to what s happening to the Republican party. It s always been a dynamic party. That s the vitality of it. You name people that want me to step down, and I can name you people in my caucus that want me to stay. If Hillary had won and dealt with things like Medicaid, MediCare and Affordable Care Act I had an important role in passing that I had a responsibly to protect that. I feel very confident in what I m doing and the support I have. Please don t think it s anything like the fracture that is in the Republican party.MCCAIN: It hasn t stopped us from winning. President Trump is in the White House. There s a break down someplace.PELOSI: This is our turn. This is the first time since 2006 when we won the Congress, and I was the leader at the time. This is the first time the House, congressional   Chuck and I, we are the ones communicating with the American people on this. We have a better deal, better jobs, better future for the American people. We feel comfortable with that. We have to get the message across. It s one thing to have a message.

"WAKE UP CALL! SOMALI WHO EXECUTED Terror Attack In Canada Entered U.S. Via Mexico","The Democrats are fighting against closing our border with Mexico at every step of the way. They want open borders It s that simple. If you vote for Democrats then you re voting for open borders. They have zero interest in stopping the flow of illegals to America. One of the key things to remember about open borders is it s not just the people from Mexico looking for a job or better life. The truth is that our open border has become a GLOBAL MAGNET for people from all over the world to come for many different reasons. One of the reasons is terrorism The case below highlights the desperate need for border control if we want to stop the flow of terrorists to America and Canada:The Somali terrorist who stabbed a Canadian police officer and ran over four pedestrians a few weeks ago entered the United States through the Mexican border and was released by Obama s Department of Homeland Security (DHS), allowing him to continue his journey north. The ISIS operative, Abdulahi Hasan Sharif, was ordered deported, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) spokeswoman told various media outlets recently, but was released on an  order of supervision  and the feds never saw him again.Sharif entered the U.S. in 2011 through the San Ysidro port of entry in California without documentation and was briefly held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego, a local newspaper reported. A year later he crossed the border into Canada and settled in Edmonton after being granted refugee status. On September 30 he slammed into an Edmonton police officer with his car then got out of the vehicle and repeatedly stabbed the cop with a knife. After fleeing the scene, Sharif stole a truck and deliberately mowed down four pedestrians. Canadian authorities found an ISIS flag in his car and have charged him with multiple counts of attempted murder, criminal flight causing bodily harm and possession of a weapon. Two years ago, Canadian authorities investigated the 30-year-old terrorist for espousing extremist views. It s disturbing that Sharif s northbound trek took him through the U.S.-Mexico border.As part of an ongoing investigation into cartels, corruption and terrorism, Judicial Watch has for years reported that Islamic extremists are entering the country through Mexico and that ISIS is operating in border towns just miles from American cities. Judicial Watch launched the project in 2014 by exposing a sophisticated narco-terror ring with strong ties to ISIS and connections running from El Paso to Chicago to New York City. Two of the FBI s most wanted were embroiled in the operation that also had deep ties to Mexico. Less than a year later, Judicial Watch reported that ISIS is operating in a Mexican border town just eight miles from El Paso, the result of Islamic terrorists joining forces with drug cartels and human smugglers knowns as  coyotes. When Judicial Watch reported that Mexican cartels were smuggling foreigners from countries with terrorist links into a small Texas rural town, federal authorities publicly denied the story was true. Never the less, high-level sources on both sides of the border confirmed to Judicial Watch that foreigners, classified as Special Interest Aliens (SIA), were being transported to stash areas in Acala, a rural crossroads located around 54 miles from El Paso on a state road   Highway 20. Once in the U.S., the SIAs waited for pick-up in the area s sand hills just across Highway 20. At the time a Texas Department of Public Safety report leaked by the media had already confirmed that for years members of known Islamist terrorist organizations had been apprehended crossing the southern border.Last year a high-ranking DHS official told Judicial Watch that Mexican drug traffickers help Islamic terrorists stationed in Mexico cross into the United States to explore targets for future attacks. Among the jihadists that travel back and forth through the porous southern border is a Kuwaiti named Shaykh Mahmood Omar Khabir, an ISIS operative who lives in the Mexican state of Chihuahua not far from El Paso. Khabir trained hundreds of Al Qaeda fighters in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Yemen and has lived in Mexico for more than a year, according to information provided by Judicial Watch s government source. Now Khabir trains thousands of men mostly Syrians and Yemenis to fight in an ISIS base situated in the Mexico-U.S. border region near Ciudad Ju rez, the intelligence gathered by Judicial Watch s source reveals. Staking out U.S. targets is not difficult and Khabir actually bragged in an Italian newspaper article that the border region is so open that he  could get in with a handful of men, and kill thousands of people in Texas or in Arizona in the space of a few hours.  In the same article Mexico s top diplomat, Foreign Affairs Secretary Claudia Ruiz, said  this new wave of fundamentalism could have nasty surprises in store for the United States. While much of the American mainstream media ignores that Sharif made it to Canada via the U.S.-Mexico border, it s hardly surprising considering Islamic extremists have been infiltrating the country through the famously unprotected region for years. Referring to the recent Canadian attack, a think-tank dedicated to investigating the operations, funding, activities and front groups of Islamic extremists worldwide writes:  Fears about a terrorist using the U.S.-Mexican border as a gateway for an attack have been realized.

"BEST SUMMARY Yet Of The Shocking Clinton Uranium One Scandal From The Beginning","There s so much to know in order to understand just how bad the Uranium One scandal is to what s happening now with the Fake Russia probe by Comey. Once you understand the connections and the details of it, you realize it s HUGE!It s not just the Clinton grifters but Obama, the FBI and the DOJ!And at the heart of it is not just the greedy, grasping Clintons, but the Obama Administration, the FBI and the DOJ.Andrew McCarthy does a masterful job of breaking down the entire scandal from beginning until now.McCarthy breaks it all down for you.You ll be shocked to know that the same people investigating the phony Trump/Russia  collusion  were aware of the Uranium One scam AND even helped to cover it up! Here s just a little of what Andy McCarthy explains to us in his summary:Here s the kicker: The Uranium One scandal is not only, or even principally, a Clinton scandal. It is an Obama-administration scandal.The Clintons were just doing what the Clintons do: cashing in on their  public service.  The Obama administration, with Secretary Clinton at the forefront but hardly alone, was knowingly compromising American national-security interests. The administration green-lighted the transfer of control over one-fifth of American uranium-mining capacity to Russia, a hostile regime   and specifically to Russia s state-controlled nuclear-energy conglomerate, Rosatom. Worse, at the time the administration approved the transfer, it knew that Rosatom s American subsidiary was engaged in a lucrative racketeering enterprise that had already committed felony extortion, fraud, and money-laundering offenses.This next part is even worse:The Obama administration also knew that congressional Republicans were trying to stop the transfer. Consequently, the Justice Department concealed what it knew. DOJ allowed the racketeering enterprise to continue compromising the American uranium industry rather than commencing a prosecution that would have scotched the transfer. Prosecutors waited four years before quietly pleading the case out for a song, in violation of Justice Department charging guidelines. Meanwhile, the administration stonewalled Congress, reportedly threatening an informant who wanted to go public.Read more here: Andy McCarthyOnce you read the entire summary you ll know just how bad this entire scandal is and how the Obama administration covered it all up.

"WATCH: IRRELEVANT DEM POLITICAL ANALYST James Carville Says Trumps Mental State Needs To Be Looked At Because of His Sentence Structure","On Friday s broadcast of HBO s  Real Time,  former Clinton Campaign Manager James Carville stated that President Trump lacks empathy and sentence structure, and someone has to examine his mental state like people did at the end of the Reagan presidency.Carville said,  I think what happened was, is General Kelly told the president when he called this war widow that   look when, people   fighting men and women understand that when they take on this mission they could die for the country or for each other, and it s something that binds them together, and you have to make that point. Of course, Trump has no empathy and his sentence structure is completely gone. He can t say two sentences.   So, he gets on the phone, and he says,  Well, that s what he signed up for.  And General Kelly heard what I wanted. I mean, the truth of the matter is, somebody has to look. You know, when President Reagan was president, towards the end of his term, Howard Baker had a memo, and they seriously were looking to see if he had any kind of cognitive issues and they decided that he did not. I don t think Trump is capable of making those two thoughts.   BreitbartAt about the 2-minute mark, Democrat Party political analyst James Carville starts his rant about why President Trump needs to look at Trump s mental state:In October of 2016, James Carville piled on with another guy who just can t seem to get anything right, crybaby Mark Cuban. Carville and Cuban were guests on Maher s show when Carville told Bill Maher and friends that then-candidate Trump was going to quit the race.BILL MAHER: Donald Trump was supposed to have a rally tomorrow with Paul Ryan and now he has been disinvited   this just happened before we went   and it s going to be Mike Pence and Paul Ryan. Wow. When the top of the ticket is disinvited to his own rally?MARK CUBAN: He s finally toxic. Donald Trump is finally toxic.JAMES CARVILLE: Mark and I got in a discussion before the show. I think he s going to quit. Really, right now, I m saying right here.[APPLAUSE]MAHER: You know why he s not going to win? Because his basket of deplorable and if the basket fits Carville hasn t been right about too much of anything in his career, but since he helped to get the impeached rapist into the White House, the media will always use him as their go-to-guy when it comes to getting advice on how to stop the Republicans winning elections.",politics,"Oct 21, 2017"
"HILLARY WORKED FEVERISHLY To Return 10 Russian Spies Operating In U.S. In Midst Of Selling 20% Of U.S. Uranium To Russia","Why is this not front page news on every major media outlet?Russian intelligence targeted Hillary Clinton before she became secretary of state in 2009, FBI documents show.New FBI information about corruption in a Clinton-approved uranium deal with Russia raises questions about Clinton s actions after the FBI broke up a deep-cover Russian spy ring in 2010.For a decade, the FBI ran an operation called Ghost Stories to monitor and rip apart a deep-cover Russian agent network. Ghost Stories tracked a ring Russian spies who lived between Boston and Washington, D.C., under false identities. It was one of the FBI s most elaborate and successful counterintelligence operations in history.After the FBI arrested 10 of the spies in June, 2010, Secretary of State Clinton worked feverishly to return the Russian agents to Moscow in a hastily arranged, lopsided deal with Putin.It all happened as the uranium deal was in play: An arrangement to provide Moscow s state Rosatom nuclear agency with 20 percent of American uranium capacity, with $145,000,000 to pour into the Clinton Family Foundation and its projects.For the Clintons, the FBI s biggest counterintelligence bust in history couldn t have come at a worse time.The day the FBI arrested the Russian agents, on June 28, 2010, the day before the secretary of state s husband, Bill Clinton, was to give a speech in Moscow. A Kremlin-connected investment bank, Renaissance Capital, paid the former president $500,000 for the hour-long appearance.An unnamed Hillary Clinton spokesman told ABC News that there was  no reason to think the Secretary was a target of this spy ring. That was a lie.Under the code name Operation Ghost Stories, the FBI had been working the ring for a decade. Its targets had burrowed in along the Acela Corridor between Boston, New York, and Washington DC. They lived normal daily lives as Americans to attend universities, run businesses, marry, and conceive and raise children to infiltrate society and subvert government institutions. One of the SVR agents had stolen the identity of a six-week-old Canadian baby who had died in 1963. That prompted the Ghost Stories code name. The ring inspired the FX network s television series,  The Americans. As with any secretary of state, Hillary Clinton would be a primary target under any circumstance. But she was much more. She was a known quantity: predictable, vain and ruthless, and with an insatiable desire for cash to enrich her family, friends, and political machine. Blindly ambitious to become president of the world s only superpower and swearing to come back after losing in 2008 to Barack Obama, she was the 21st century KGB s perfect mark.Read more: Daily Caller",politics,"Oct 21, 2017"

Uh-I-uh-mean that-uh-that folks looking fifty years back. It s the 21st century. Obama really was the most divisive POTUS in history. It s pretty unbelievable that he s now claiming Trump is divisive. This made us think of slinky and the tactics used by Obama in the past to divide Americans: Saul Alinsky 101: Accuse your opponent of what only you are doing, as you are doing it, to create confusion, cloud the issue, and inoculate voters against any evidence of your guilt. That about nails what Obama did in the video above. He and Hillary are fans and supporters of Saul Alinsky. Check out the video below:Let s see if you notice any other tactics used by the left in trying to bring down President Trump:Alinsky s 12 Rules: 1.  Power is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have.  Power is derived from 2 main sources   money and people.  Have-Nots  must build power from flesh and blood. 2.  Never go outside the expertise of your people.  It results in confusion, fear and retreat. Feeling secure adds to the backbone of anyone. 3.  Whenever possible, go outside the expertise of the enemy.  Look for ways to increase insecurity, anxiety and uncertainty. 4.  Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules.  If the rule is that every letter gets a reply, send 30,000 letters. You can kill them with this because no one can possibly obey all of their own rules. 5.  Ridicule is man s most potent weapon.  There is no defense. It s irrational. It s infuriating. It also works as a key pressure point to force the enemy into concessions. 6.  A good tactic is one your people enjoy.  They ll keep doing it without urging and come back to do more. They re doing their thing, and will even suggest better ones. 7.  A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.  Don t become old news. 8.  Keep the pressure on. Never let up.  Keep trying new things to keep the opposition off balance. As the opposition masters one approach, hit them from the flank with something new. 9.  The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself.  Imagination and ego can dream up many more consequences than any activist. 10.  If you push a negative hard enough, it will push through and become a positive.  Violence from the other side can win the public to your side because the public sympathizes with the underdog. 11.  The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative.  Never let the enemy score points because you re caught without a solution to the problem. 12.  Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.  Cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy. Go after people and not institutions; people hurt faster than institutions.TUCKER AND MARK STEYN DISCUSS THIS TACTIC: Why is it the left always accuses its  opponents of the exact same thing they re guilty of?  @TuckerCarlson  RT #MAGA #TRUMP #Weinstein pic.twitter.com/g5oI4TqVHR  DONNA WARREN   (@DonnaWR8) October 12, 2017",politics,"Oct 21, 2017"

"AUDIT REVEALS: 150 AFGHAN TROOPS Have Gone AWOL In U.S. During Training&Some Still Missing","The new report on the number of missing Afghan trainees draws attention to the current policy that obviously needs to be changed. The terror risk is bad enough and the cost to train these soldier is HUGE. Remember when Obama was famously called out for the outrageous cost per trainee? Reuters reported in October of 2016 that  Washington has allocated more than $60 billion since 2002 to train and equip Afghan troops. This is a waste of taxpayer dollars. Immigration agents say they re  worried  about the terror risk with these AWOL trainees.While other foreign troops on U.S. military training visits have sometimes run away, a U.S. defense official said that the frequency of Afghan troops going missing was concerning and  out of the ordinary. More than 150 Afghan troops brought to the U.S. for military training have gone AWOL since 2005, with 13 of them still unaccounted for and perhaps living as here illegal immigrants now, an inspector general said in a new report Friday.Part of the problem is that the U.S. never puts the trainees through an in-person interview and exempts them from registering as aliens when they arrive   both steps that other visitors would normally have to go through.In-person interviews and requiring the troops to register beforehand would help the government gauge whether someone is likely to go absent without leave, and would give immigration officers information about relatives in the U.S. as starting points when someone does go AWOL, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction said.But the State Department rejected those suggestions.The audit said that while no acts of terrorism have yet been traced to the trainees, immigration agents say they re worried because a number who go AWOL end up trying to claim asylum in the U.S., stymieing any national security investigation into their behavior.Beyond the potential danger, American taxpayers also miss out on the investment in the troops, the inspector general said. It is clear that Afghan trainees go AWOL while in the United States at a far higher rate than do trainees from any other country, and we believe that the State Department (as well as other government agencies) should use all the tools at their disposal to reduce these occurrences and ensure that Afghan trainees return to Afghanistan and make use of the substantial U.S. taxpayer investment in training,  the audit concluded.The number of troops going AWOL surged in 2015 and 2016 as security back home deteriorated.Some Afghan troops currently being trained in the U.S. said the Taliban threatened their families back home once it became known they had a relative training here. Many of them said the training made them bigger targets when they returned.Investigators identified 152 Afghan trainees who have gone absent without leave under the training program. Seventy of them fled the U.S., 39 managed to obtain legal status here, three returned to duty, 27 were arrested and put in deportation proceedings, and 13 remain unaccounted for.The largest number disappeared from training at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, but four went AWOL from training in D.C., three disappeared from Quantico, Virginia, and one from Arlington.The State Department and Homeland Security said they don t think there s a reason to be concerned.Read more: WTA PREVIOUS REPORT ON TWO AFGHAN TRAINEES THAT WENT MISSING:THE TWO TRAINEES ARE STILL MISSING!

The students and their class were set to graduate on Dec. 18.Federal authorities are involved because these are international military students, said Captain Korey Fratini, Chief of Public Affairs for the air force base.The two students were last accounted for Friday but did not show up for duty on Monday.They are part of Afghan Air Force and are maintenance aircraft students here training to learn how to maintain the a29 Super Tucano.

The Ferguson play will, no doubt, force viewers to question how much of what the media feeds them is real, and how much is propaganda that feeds their leftist agenda.  What is FERGUSON?FERGUSON is a staged reenactment of the controversial killing of Michael Brown using ONLY Grand Jury testimony. No spin. No media filter. Just the truth. Nine cast members of the staged reading in Los Angeles walked out before opening night because of their desire to rewrite the script. But you can t rewrite the truth; you can t rewrite history. See for yourself!LA Weekly called the staged reading of FERGUSON  a riveting spectacle  and  an incendiary evening of theatre.  This is the World Premiere of a full production.FERGUSON is a Verbatim Play   it only uses actual Grand Jury testimony from eyewitnesses who saw police officer Daren Wilson shoot, Michael Brown. Most of these eyewitnesses are minorities and yet their accounts are totally at odds with the stories spun by the mainstream media and activists.As guests at the opening of the thought-provoking Ferguson-the play began to exit the theater, Phelim approached a random woman to get her reaction to the performance. The woman he questioned seemed confused and angry by what she just witnessed. She admits she was a Black Lives Matter supporter, and even protested with Black Lives Matter to help them to push the  hands up, don t shoot  narrative. After realizing that she had been lied to by the media, she asks Phelim,  Why did I demonstrate  Hands in the air Don t shoot ?

"MELANIA SAVES TAXPAYERS A Fortune By Making Shocking Cuts In Number of Aides At White House Compared To Lavish Michelle Obama","Melania Trump is embracing a more active and public schedule as first lady   but she still runs one of the leanest East Wing operations in recent history.According to a Fox News analysis of White House personnel reports, Melania Trump has significantly reduced the number of aides on the first lady s office payroll in comparison to her predecessor, Michelle Obama.During then-President Barack Obama s first year in office, 16 people were listed working for Michelle Obama, earning a combined $1.24 million a year.This year, just four people were listed working for Melania Trump as of June. Their salaries totaled $486,700.The details are contained in an annual report the White House sends to Congress showing the names, positions and salaries of all its personnel. Both the Obama and Trump administrations acknowledged several additional staffers beyond those listed in the report with the term  first lady  in their titles. But even counting all those employees   24 for Michelle Obama and nine for the current first lady   Melania Trump s office is relatively small.It s an approach her spokeswoman says is intentional. As with all things that she does, she is being very deliberate in her hiring, focusing on quality over quantity,  communications director Stephanie Grisham said in an email.  It is important to her that the team is a good fit for what she wants to accomplish as first lady, and that everyone works well together. She also wants to be mindful and responsible when it comes to taxpayer money. While the 2009 annual report listed 16 staffers for Michelle Obama, her press secretary said at the time the staff actually included 24 people. A 2009 FactCheck.org story said Obama s 24 aides might have broken records.  FOX News",politics,"Oct 20, 2017"
"MOST DIVISIVE POTUS EVER Takes Swipe At Trump Using Despicable Alinsky Tactic [Video]","Barack Obama stutters through yet another jerky moment where he just can t zip his lips: He s the president who just won t go away:  Some, some of the politics we see, now we, we thought we put that to bed. Uh-I-uh-mean that-uh-that folks looking fifty years back. It s the 21st century. Obama really was the most divisive POTUS in history. It s pretty unbelievable that he s now claiming Trump is divisive. This made us think of slinky and the tactics used by Obama in the past to divide Americans: Saul Alinsky 101: Accuse your opponent of what only you are doing, as you are doing it, to create confusion, cloud the issue, and inoculate voters against any evidence of your guilt. That about nails what Obama did in the video above. He and Hillary are fans and supporters of Saul Alinsky. Check out the video below:Let s see if you notice any other tactics used by the left in trying to bring down President Trump:Alinsky s 12 Rules: 1.  Power is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have.  Power is derived from 2 main sources   money and people.  Have-Nots  must build power from flesh and blood. 2.  Never go outside the expertise of your people.  It results in confusion, fear and retreat. Feeling secure adds to the backbone of anyone. 3.  Whenever possible, go outside the expertise of the enemy.  Look for ways to increase insecurity, anxiety and uncertainty. 4.  Make the enemy live up to its own book of rules.  If the rule is that every letter gets a reply, send 30,000 letters. You can kill them with this because no one can possibly obey all of their own rules. 5.  Ridicule is man s most potent weapon.  There is no defense. It s irrational. It s infuriating. It also works as a key pressure point to force the enemy into concessions. 6.  A good tactic is one your people enjoy.  They ll keep doing it without urging and come back to do more. They re doing their thing, and will even suggest better ones. 7.  A tactic that drags on too long becomes a drag.  Don t become old news. 8.  Keep the pressure on. Never let up.  Keep trying new things to keep the opposition off balance. As the opposition masters one approach, hit them from the flank with something new. 9.  The threat is usually more terrifying than the thing itself.  Imagination and ego can dream up many more consequences than any activist. 10.  If you push a negative hard enough, it will push through and become a positive.  Violence from the other side can win the public to your side because the public sympathizes with the underdog. 11.  The price of a successful attack is a constructive alternative.  Never let the enemy score points because you re caught without a solution to the problem. 12.  Pick the target, freeze it, personalize it, and polarize it.  Cut off the support network and isolate the target from sympathy. Go after people and not institutions; people hurt faster than institutions.TUCKER AND MARK STEYN DISCUSS THIS TACTIC: Why is it the left always accuses its  opponents of the exact same thing they re guilty of?  @TuckerCarlson  RT #MAGA #TRUMP #Weinstein pic.twitter.com/g5oI4TqVHR  DONNA WARREN   (@DonnaWR8) October 12, 2017",politics,"Oct 20, 2017"
"WOW! CONFIRMED BY ICE: 5-Time Deported ILLEGAL ALIEN Protected By Sanctuary County Is Suspected ARSONIST Behind Worst Fires CA History","Remember when candidate Donald Trump was condemned by the left for telling Americans that we have criminals coming across our borders? Well, it turns out that he was not only correct, it appears as though the worst fire in California s history that caused the death of 42 so far and over $1 billion in damage to almost 3,000 homes was very likely started by an ILLEGAL ALIEN arsonist. From Donald Trump s campaign speech at a rally in Arizona: The U.S. has become a dumping ground for everybody else s problems. When Mexico sends its people, they re not sending their best. They re sending people that have lots of problems, and they re bringing those problems with us.  They re bringing drugs, they re bringing crime, they re rapists and some, I assume are good people. Watch:Well, now that ICE has confirmed that the arsonist arrested in connection with setting the fires that devastated California is a 5-time deported ILLEGAL ALIEN, who in the media is going to tell Trump they re  sorry  for criticizing him? Will it be one of the local government officials in Sonoma County who decided to make their county a  sanctuary county  to protect people like Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who was arrested Sunday?Breitbart   U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Acting Director Tom Homan confirmed on Thursday that a man arrested in connection with setting a fire in Sonoma County Wine Country is an illegal alien from Mexico who has been twice returned to his  home country. Homan also confirmed that ICE has issued detainer requests for Jesus Fabian Gonzalez five times now in the past year alone, including the one issued on October 16 in relation to his most recent arrest on suspicion of arson. All of the arrests were made  by Sonoma County on various felony and misdemeanor charges,  according to Homan.Sonoma County is considered a sanctuary jurisdiction and does not fully cooperate with federal immigration officials. That includes not honoring ICE detainer requests.  ICE was never notified of Mr. Gonzalez  various releases,  Homan wrote in the statement regarding Gonzalez.There were several fires in the region, and it is not clear what role the fires Gonzales allegedly set played in the overall disaster.The LA Times reported on the incident from eyewitnesses after Gonzalez was seen leaving the scene of the fire: He was screaming really bad things at the police when he was arrested,  recalled David Moreno, 29, who witnessed the arrest.  He was yelling things like,  I m going to teach you a lesson you ll never forget. Three Sonoma County probation officers patrolling Maxwell Farms Regional Park just before 3 p.m. noticed a plume of smoke rising from an area near the Sonoma Creek, Sheriff s Department spokeswoman Misti Harris said.Gonzalez walked away from the fire as the officers approached, Harris said. Nobody else was in the area,  Harris said.Sonoma County Sheriff s Department deputies followed Gonzalez to a nearby McDonald s. Gonzalez had  previous contacts  with law enforcement, she said.Gonzalez told police he started the fire because he was cold, Harris said. Officers found a lighter in his pocket.*The recorded temperature at the time that the fires started was a balmy 78 degrees.Some homeless people who knew Gonzalez said that he had a habit of setting fire to brush along the creek bed.Tensions were already high in this smoke-filled region, about 25 miles east of Santa Rosa.Local mechanic Shawn Stephensen, 40, said,  A few days ago I was walking down the street with a gas can and someone driving by stopped to say,  I wouldn t be carrying a thing like that around at a time like this. At first I didn t get it,  Stephensen, who knew Gonzalez, said.  Then it dawned on me    Oh yeah, instant felony case. What will Governor Jerry Brown, who recently signed off on legislation that makes the entire state of California a  sanctuary state  have to say about this recent development?

He famously said during the 2016 campaign that he would fight against Trump s agenda:The October conference call apparently was intended only for House Republican members. It s unclear which or how many House Republicans took part in the call, whether the participants knew it was being recorded, who made the recording, or whether a recording exists of the entire call. The remarks on the portion provided to Breitbart News certainly sound like they were coming from Speaker Ryan, who seemed to be abandoning his party s presidential nominee altogether just weeks before the election. He says not only will he not defend the Access Hollywood comments, but he will not campaign with Trump at all between this call on Oct. 10, 2016, and the general election for the presidency on Nov. 8 and that Ryan would not defend Trump on anything generally.

"WHAT? MATT LAUER ASKS OBAMAS Former CIA Director If Trumps Inner Circle Is Prepared To Tackle or Lock Him In A Room To Keep Trump From Using Nuclear Weapons [VIDEO]","NBC host Matt Lauer on Thursday asked former CIA Director John Brennan whether military officials surrounding President Donald Trump would  tackle him  before he engaged in a nuclear confrontation.Brennan replied that Trump has unilateral authority to authorize military action.Lauer asked Brennan hesitantly about reports surrounding America s procedure to deploy nuclear weapons under Trump, emphasizing the stories of  key players around the president  maybe locking Trump in a room or even tackling him to prevent the use of such weapons. I feel weird asking you this, but you ve read the same stories I ve read,  Lauer said to Brennan.  You know the key players around the president in [Jim] Mattis, [H.R.] McMaster, and John Kelly. Stories are going around out there that if the president inches closer to some kind of a nuclear confrontation with North Korea, that those guys are going to do something. They re going to lock him in a room. They re going to tackle him. Watch the incredible exchange here: You re smiling,  Lauer added.  But these are the stories that are out there. And they will prevent him from carrying out any action that would cause that. Is that all nonsense? No, I think the military leaders, current and former, Mattis, Kelly, also Joe Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs, they know the risks of escalation,  said Brennan, who served as CIA director during the Obama administration.  They know just how dangerous the situation is. I think they are governors on the president s instincts to continue to try to intimidate and bully. You re technically not answering the question. Would they take some action to prevent the president from carrying out an order?  Lauer asked. The president has unilateral authority to be able to authorize military action,  Brennan said.  That order goes through Secretary Mattis. Secretary Mattis can try to talk him out of it, disagree with it, carry it out, or not. After Brennan walked Lauer through the usual White House process of authorizing military actions, Lauer pushed his original question about tackling Trump, using a quote from Brennan. In July you said it is the obligation of some executive officials to refuse to carry out some of those orders that are inconsistent with what this country is all about,  Lauer quoted Brennan.Brennan clarified that he made that comment  in the context  of the firing of former FBI Director Jim Comey and the efforts to  delay and to put obstacles in some of the investigations that are underway. We are a country of laws,  Brennan added.  WFB ",politics,"Oct 19, 2017"

"BLACK HOMICIDE VICTIMS Killed Mostly By Black Criminals Jumps 900 Per Yr. Since Start Of Black Lives Matter&Number Of Cops Killed By Blacks Is STUNNING","Lost in the uproar over the NFL sideline protests against police brutality are newly released statistics showing that the threat to black men is skyrocketing   not from trigger-happy or racist cops, but from crime.More than any other demographic group, black men are paying the price with their lives with a surging violent crime rate over the past two years, including a 20 percent jump in the overall homicide rate, even as the number of blacks killed by police declines.Using homicide figures from the 2016 FBI Uniform Crime Report released Sept. 25, Manhattan Institute fellow Heather Mac Donald found that the number of black homicide victims has jumped by nearly 900 per year since the Black Lives Matter movement took root in 2014. The majority of victims of that homicide surge have been black,  Ms. Mac Donald said in an email.  They were killed overwhelmingly by black criminals, not by the police and not by whites. Meanwhile, the number of blacks killed by police dipped from 259 in 2015 to 233 in 2016, with 2017 so far coming in below both years with 175 deaths as of Oct. 12, according to The Washington Post s Fatal Force database.Ms. Mac Donald and others have blamed the increasingly hands-off approach of police officers who are worried about running afoul of the Black Lives Matter movement after the 2014 shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. She dubbed it  the Ferguson effect. Peter Moskos, associate professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, tracked the same phenomenon in Baltimore after the April 2015 rioting over the death of a black man in police custody. He calls it  the Freddie Gray effect.  He found a spike in homicides and shootings after the riots, which were followed by Baltimore State s Attorney Marilyn Mosby s decision to charge six officers in Gray s death. Three of the officers were acquitted in non-jury trials, and charges against the other three were dismissed. Police were instructed   both by city leaders and then in the odd DOJ report city leaders asked for   to be less proactive since such policing will disproportionately affect minorities,  Mr. Moskos said in a Sept. 4 post.  Few seem to care that minorities are disproportionately affected by the rise in murder. Officers also have been hit: Ms. Mac Donald said there was a 53 percent increase in 2016 in the shooting deaths of cops, while The Washington Post database found that only 16 of the 233 black men killed by police in 2016 were unarmed. A police officer is 18 times more likely to be killed by a black male than an unarmed black male is to be killed by a police officer,  Ms. Mac Donald said.  Black males have made up 42 percent of all cop killers over the past decade, though they are only 6 percent of the population. Those involved with Black Lives Matter have said in the past that prosecuting such killings is easier than cases involving police force against civilians.While the NFL kneeling began as a protest against police brutality, those involved have increasingly expanded the point to encompass what San Francisco 49ers safety Eric Reid described as  systemic oppression that has been rampant in this country for decades and decades. Rashad Robinson, senior campaign director at Color of Change, said President Trump s recent suggestion that owners should fire players who refuse to stand for the national anthem represents a view within sports that  black people serve at the pleasure of white people. Almost every NFL owner is white. Nearly 70% of players are Black,  Mr. Robinson said in a written statement.  Yet for Donald Trump, this power imbalance is not enough   he wants to be sure that players who exercise their right to protest social injustice can be fired with impunity. This is what it means to advance a white supremacist worldview.   Washington Times",politics,"Oct 19, 2017"

"ONE BRAVE MAN Is About To Reveal The Truth About What REALLY Happened In Ferguson&Black Lives Matter and The Media Are NOT Going To Be Happy [VIDEO]","Thanks to one very brave journalist and filmmaker, FERGUSON, a very important and extremely controversial play, is set to begin in New York City on October 19 and will run through October 30th.The New York version of FERGUSON is directed by Jerry Dixon.Much like the contentious real-life drama that played out on the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, when Michael Brown was shot dead by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson, filmmaker Phelim McAleer s controversial retelling of what really happened that fateful day in the Ferguson the play, using only the Grand Jury testimony from the Officer Wilson trial, is sure to ruffle some feathers.Black Lives Matter has been perpetuating a lie about Michael Brown and how he was a victim of murder at the hands of a white police officer, who had no grounds whatsoever to shoot him.FERGUSON is a Verbatim Play   it only uses actual Grand Jury testimony from eyewitnesses who saw police officer Daren Wilson shoot Michael Brown. Most of these eyewitnesses are minorities and yet their accounts are totally at odds with the stories spun by the mainstream media and activists.This is why it is so important to bring the truth to New York. Obviously the New York theatrical establishment won t support this play. They seem to really detest anything that challenges their cozy consensus world view.Ferguson the play, was the brainchild of journalist and filmmaker Phelim McAleer, who many know for his hard-hitting documentary Fracknation, that pulled the curtain back on a false narrative being pushed by liberal activists and politicians, and exposed the truth behind the lies Americans were being told about the dangers of fracking.Two years ago, when rehearsal began in Los Angeles for FERGUSON, McAleer found himself having to deal with 9 actors who walked out when rehearsals began, after reading the script (that is based on the verbatim Grand Jury testimony of the witnesses during the officer Wilson trial).What makes FERGUSON so compelling, is that not one word of the Grand Jury testimony is altered or changed. McAleer, who was determined to keep the show alive, explains how difficult it has been to get his play to the New York stage:McAleer tells viewers in the promotional video below, that the truth about what really happened in Ferguson is not what the mainstream media s been telling you.:  The truth was so shocking to so many people, that 9 of the cast walked out during rehearsals in Los Angeles. I was determined that the show would go on, even though the cast walked out. And the cast walked out because what they wanted to believe, didn t match the truth that was in the  Grand Jury documents. They were so convinced by the media, of one version of events, and the truth didn t matter to them, and they couldn t handle it. So that s why it s so important to bring this to New York. Phelim goes on to remind viewers of how Mike Pence was attacked by the cast and audience when he went to see Hamilton in New York.Despite the 9 members of the cast who walked out on the play in Los Angeles and the anger the play incited in many supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement, FERGUSON was very well-received by critics after its debut in Los Angeles.Watch:Phelim McAleer is asking for help to fund his FERGUSON production. Please consider making a contribution to this very worthy cause by clicking HERE to donate.FERGUSON  made for a riveting spectacle and comes as a reminder both of the adversarial dramatic power that is inherent in any courtroom testimony and how even the dry language of a legal transcript can come alive when placed in the hands of skilled actors. Add a standing-room-only audience and the high stakes of this country s ongoing debate about race, police profiling and its use of lethal force, and you ve got the ingredients for an incendiary evening of theater.  -LA WEEKLYHopefully, FERGUSON the play will cause Americans to understand what really happened in Ferguson through the eyes of the people who testified to what they actually saw that day and not through the lies of the mainstream media and the false narrative of Black Lives Matter leaders and activists.",politics,"Oct 18, 2017"
"THEY KNEW! CLOSE CLINTON FRIEND Warned Against Agreeing To Allow Sexual Predator Harvey Weinstein To Host Fundraisers&They Did It Anyway","In June of 2016, the disgraced sexual predator, and Hollywood producer, Harvey Weinstein, hosted a fundraiser for Hillary s presidential campaign in Manhattan. Some of the top celebrities in the business accepted Harvey s invitation to the event. Celebrity donors who were in attendance at the event included Leo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lopez, and Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick. Weinstein raised $1.8 million for Hillary at his star-studded fundraiser. When Hillary was asked if she was planning to give any of the money back or would give it to charity, the Clinton Foundation claimed they would not give back a cent, and that the money had already been spent on other  charitable purposes .  We re wondering what, exactly the Clinton Foundation means by  charitable purposes ?  Like Chelsea s wedding that was partially funded by the Clinton Foundation?A TV writer and close Clinton family friend says she warned at least three  top-level Democratic operatives  against allowing Harvey Weinstein to host fundraisers. A warning that evidently (and to the glee of Fox News) fell on deaf ears,  writes  Designing Women  creator Linda Bloodworth-Thomason in a new Hollywood Reporter op-ed.Weinstein gave thousands and bundled $1.42 million in donations to Hillary Clinton s presidential run, but the former secretary of state has said she had no idea about the producer s predatory ways.Bloodworth-Thomason, who has created political promotional films for both Clintons, said she helped President Bill Clinton pen an apology amid his own sex scandal and that his actions have  taxed my feminist conscience    but she still loves him  dearly. She says she has long been aware of Weinstein s lecherous ways and is skeptical of those now claiming ignorance. Some said this despite knowing him for decades, starring in his films and being friends with accusers who starred in his films,  she writes.But although Weinstein was  at the top of the sexual predator food chain  she says the industry is rife with men like him. These kinds of atrocities against women routinely go unreported and unpunished in the entertainment industry. The No. 1 casting criterion in Hollywood is that, above all else, an actress must be  hot and f kable,  she writes.  Page Six ",politics,"Oct 18, 2017"
"SARAH SANDERS Slams Cowgirl Congresswomans Criticism of Trump: Appalling [Video]","White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders on Wednesday blasted Democratic Rep. Frederica Wilson s criticism of the president s call to a fallen soldier s widow as  appalling and disgusting,  even as the congresswoman stood by her account. I think it s appalling what the congresswoman has done and the way she s politicized this issue and the way that she s trying to make this about something that it isn t,  Sanders said during the White House press briefing.The dispute has steadily escalated   puncuated by claims and counter-claims via Twitter, briefings and interviews   ever since Wilson, D-Fla., claimed Tuesday that President Trump told the widow of Army Sgt. La David Johnson during a phone call that  he knew what he signed up for. Johnson was among four service members killed earlier this month during an ambush in Niger. Wilson called Trump s remarks in the phone call insensitive.Johnson s mother, Cowanda Jones-Johnson, later backed up the congresswoman s account, telling The Associated Press that Trump showed  disrespect. But Sanders defended the president s tone. This was a president who loves our country very much, who has the greatest level of respect for men and women in the uniform and wanted to call and offer condolences to the family. And I think to try to create something from that that the congresswoman is doing is frankly appalling and disgusting,  she told reporters.Read more: Fox News",politics,"Oct 18, 2017"
"HANNITY TEARS IT UP IN HIS BEST EVER RANT: Hillary Clinton and Her Husband Sold Out America to the Russians! [Video]","Sean Hannity was on fire with his opening comments on the Clinton-Uranium One deal bombshell last night. He ripped the Clintons and called on Trump s intelligence and law officials to investigate the scandal. It s a classic Hannity rant:  After President Trump won in November, President Obama and his administration   they were telling anyone who would listen,  Russia! Russia! Russia! Russia interfered with our election. Russia was creating a direct threat to American democracy  Hannity mocked.  Well if that s the case, why when they have mountains of evidence that we will reveal tonight of Russian bribery going back to 2009, why then would the Obama administration and Hillary in particular sign off on the sale of 20% of America s uranium to Vladimir Putin and the Russians? Tonight, with this new evidence, what we have discovered is that the evidence against the Clintons is overwhelming, it is incontrovertible,  Hannity continued.  Hillary Clinton and her husband sold out America to the Russians while millions of dollars flowed to their family foundation. And in the process, Clinton created a massive national security risk for every man, woman, and child   giving Vladimir Putin control over American uranium. IN CASE YOU HAVEN T HEARD ABOUT THE LATEST ON THE CLINTON-URANIUM ONE BOMBSHELL:Yesterday, the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange sent a cryptic tweet that contained a series of number and letters.

Will justice finally be delivered to these corrupt, anti-American, self-serving and lying players? Not providing information on a corruption scheme before the Russian uranium deal was approved by U.S. regulators and engage appropriate congressional committees has served to undermine U.S. national security interests by the very people charged with protecting them. The Russian efforts to manipulate our American political enterprise is breathtaking.    Former House Intelligence Chair Mike Rogers (R-MI)The Hill   Before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.They also obtained an eyewitness account   backed by documents   indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.The racketeering scheme was conducted  with the consent of higher level officials  in Russia who  shared the proceeds  from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.Rather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefitting Putin s commercial nuclear ambitions.The first decision occurred in October 2010, when the State Department and government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, giving Moscow control of more than 20 percent of America s uranium supply.When this sale was used by Trump on the campaign trail last year, Hillary Clinton s spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the State Department official who handled it said she  never intervened   on any [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] matter. In 2011, the administration gave approval for Rosatom s Tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants in a partnership with the United States Enrichment Corp. Before then, Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program. The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,  a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.The Obama administration s decision to approve Rosatom s purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015.That s when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.The Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal.But FBI, Energy Department and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the FBI, in fact, had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee s decision that Vadim Mikerin   the main Russian overseeing Putin s nuclear expansion inside the United States   was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.Then-Attorney General Eric Holder was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time the Uranium One deal was approved. Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn t comment.Mikerin was a director of Rosatom s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom s new American arm called Tenam.Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin  did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons   to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,  a November 2014 indictment stated.His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show. The investigation was ultimately supervised by then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, an Obama appointee who now serves as President Trump s deputy attorney general, and then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe, now the deputy FBI director under Trump, Justice Department documents show.On August 6, 2017,  The Washington Times questioned Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein s  fishing expedition  aimed at digging up dirt on President Trump in his investigation in the Trump-Russia investigation. The special counsel is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Justice, and we don t engage in fishing expeditions,  Mr. Rosenstein said on  Fox News Sunday. In his first Sunday show interview, Mr. Rosenstein added that special counsel Robert Mueller  understands and I understand the specific scope of the investigation and so, it s not a fishing expedition. Mr. Rosenstein s comments come amid reports citing unnamed sources that the investigation has expanded into Mr. Trump s finances unrelated to possible Russian interference in last year s election.Mr. Rosenstein played down the reports:  That s not anything that I ve said. That s not anything Director Mueller has said. We don t know who s saying it or how credible those sources are. Both men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible, but still unproven collusion between Russia and Donald Trump s campaign during the 2016 election.McCabe is under congressional and Justice Department inspector general investigation in connection with money his wife s Virginia state Senate campaign accepted in 2015 from now-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe at a time when McAuliffe was reportedly under investigation by the FBI.The connections to the current Russia case are many. The Mikerin probe began in 2009 when Robert Mueller, now the special counsel in charge of the Trump case, was still FBI director. And it ended in late 2015 under the direction of then-FBI Director James Comey, who Trump fired earlier this year.Bringing down a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme that had both compromised a sensitive uranium transportation asset inside the U.S. and facilitated international money laundering would seem a major feather in any law enforcement agency s cap.But the Justice Department and FBI took little credit in 2014 when Mikerin, the Russian financier and the trucking firm executives were arrested and charged.The only public statement occurred an entire year later when the Justice Department put out a little-noticed press release in August 2015, just days before Labor Day. The release noted that the various defendants had reached plea deals.The lack of fanfare left many key players in Washington with no inkling that a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme with serious national security implications had been uncovered.On Dec. 15, 2015, the Justice Department put out a release stating that Mikerin,  a former Russian official residing in Maryland was sentenced today to 48 months in prison  and ordered to forfeit more than $2.1 million.Ronald Hosko, who served as the assistant FBI director in charge of criminal cases when the investigation was underway, told The Hill he did not recall ever being briefed about Mikerin s case by the counterintelligence side of the bureau despite the criminal charges that were being lodged. I had no idea this case was being conducted,  a surprised Hosko said in an interview.Meanwhile, Julian Assange is jumping on the bandwagon, as he teases that he has a major announcement of his own that is coming soon Russian nuclear bribery investigation reveals that Russia routed millions to the Clintons https://t.co/ti7ycn7auf  Julian Assange   (@JulianAssange) October 17, 2017",politics,"Oct 18, 2017"

"CA FIRE UPDATE: Jesus Fabian Gonzalez Arrested For Suspicion of ARSON In Sanctuary County After Hes Caught Walking Away From Fire With Lighter In Pocket","Yesterday, a man who is likely an illegal alien was arrested on suspicion of arson in the sanctuary county of Sonoma, where wildfires have devasted the lives of hundreds of thousands of Californians and destroyed structures worth billions of dollars. The only news, however, that most of America will read about today, is news of an unproven allegation by a Democrat Representative from Texas about a conversation President Trump allegedly had with a grieving military widow. This story, of course, is a much bigger story, with actual evidence that points to the very real possibility that the Sonoma County Sheriff s office has, in their custody, the arsonist who s responsible for the largest fire in California s history. It s also quite possible, that without the aid of the local and state government officials, who have gone out of their way to protect illegal aliens living in their communities, we wouldn t even be reading about these horrific wildfires.Sonoma County fires have killed dozens. 172 are still missing and 102,000 residents have been dislocated   about one-fifth of the entire population. The latest financial losses include 3,819 unincorporated parcels with 100 structures valued at $2,016,962,239, and 2,907 homes and 86 commercial units lost in the city of Santa Rosa valued at $1.18 billion.Breitbart   The U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) issued a detainer request on the Sonoma County Jail for Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who was arrested Sunday on suspicion of arson in Wine Country fires that have killed at least 40 residents.Breitbart News reported earlier this week that Sonoma County Sheriffs had arrested Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, 29, at Maxwell Regional Park in Sonoma County after a series of reports of ongoing fires in the region. Mr. Gonzalez was observed around 3:00 p.m. PDT wearing a jacket and walking  out of the creek area and a plume of smoke behind him,  according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.LA Times    He was screaming really bad things at the police when he was arrested,  recalled David Moreno, 29, who witnessed the arrest.  He was yelling things like,  I m going to teach you a lesson you ll never forget. Three Sonoma County probation officers patrolling Maxwell Farms Regional Park just before 3 p.m. noticed a plume of smoke rising from an area near the Sonoma Creek, Sheriff s Department spokeswoman Misti Harris said.Gonzalez walked away from the fire as the officers approached, Harris said. Nobody else was in the area,  Harris said.Sonoma County Sheriff s Department deputies followed Gonzalez to a nearby McDonald s. Gonzalez had  previous contacts  with law enforcement, she said.Gonzalez told police he started the fire because he was cold, Harris said. Officers found a lighter in his pocket.*The recorded temperature at the time that the fires started was a balmy 78 degrees.Some homeless people who knew Gonzalez said that he had a habit of setting fire to brush along the creek bed.Tensions were already high in this smoke-filled region, about 25 miles east of Santa Rosa.Local mechanic Shawn Stephensen, 40, said,  A few days ago I was walking down the street with a gas can and someone driving by stopped to say,  I wouldn t be carrying a thing like that around at a time like this. At first I didn t get it,  Stephensen, who knew Gonzalez, said.  Then it dawned on me    Oh yeah, instant felony case. Mr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson. His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.Sargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a  sanctuary county  in May 2014. The county only cooperates with  ICE holds  if the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years. Mr. Gonzalez s immigration status has not yet been announced.The American Civil Liberties Union argues detainers are a violation of  unreasonable searches and seizures  under the U.S. Constitution s Fourth Amendment.The Sonoma County Sheriff Department s  1.0 Policy Statement  reads:  No person shall be held solely on the basis of their immigration status.  The policy adds that  the immigration status of a person, and the lack of immigration documentation, should have no bearing on the manner in which Sheriff s Office personnel execute their duties. Gonzalez is being held on bail of $110,000, according to Sonoma County booking records   $10,000 for the felony arson charge, and $100,000 for a bench warrant issued in Ventura County.Gonzalez was scheduled to be arraigned Monday in a county jail facility because the courts were closed due to the disaster. The arraignment was closed to the public and media.Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano on Tuesday afternoon tried to tamp down speculation that Gonzalez was responsible for fires that have killed more than 40 people in Northern California and destroyed thousands of homes.Sonoma County Sheriff Rob Giordano on Tuesday afternoon tried to tamp down speculation that Gonzalez was responsible for fires that have killed more than 40 people in Northern California and destroyed thousands of homes.

It s pretty funny that Wilson calls Trump crazy while wearing a glittery cowgirl hat 24/7.The  Resist  movement includes Wilson who refused to go to Trump s inauguration. Wilson also attacked the president in May when she said said he  needs psychological help and is desperate for attention.  Perhaps Cowgirl Wilson should look in the mirror .According to left leaning propaganda news NBC: He said,  But you know he must ve known what he signed up for,  the Democrat recounted Trump saying more than once during the call to express his sympathy. According to Wilson, the conversation lasted somewhere from three to five minutes. Everyone knows when you go to war you could possibly not come back alive but you don t remind a grieving widow of that,  Wilson said.  That s so insensitive. Trump  didn t even remember his name,  Wilson recalled Myeshia Johnson telling her after the call ended, the congresswoman told MSNBC s  Morning Joe  Wednesday. She hung up the phone and said,  He didn t even remember his name,  Wilson said.  That s the hurting part. The White House said Tuesday that the president had called the families of all four service members who were killed.  He offered condolences on behalf of a grateful nation and assured them their family s extraordinary sacrifice to the country will never be forgotten,  the White House said.Asked about Wilson s characterization of the call, a White House official said Tuesday night that  the president s conversations with the families of American heroes who have made the ultimate sacrifice are private.

They want to question at every turn what he says he s committed to,  Hegseth said.  There s no one more committed, I believe, to our service members, to our veterans than this president. He said this shows how committed Democrats are to resisting Trump no matter what.TRUMP HITS BACK:Trump hit back at the claims saying he has proof of what was said on the call:Democrat Congresswoman totally fabricated what I said to the wife of a soldier who died in action (and I have proof).

"WATCH: CNN Reporter Gets SKEWERED For MOCKING Polio Survivor Mitch McConnell After Trump Helps Him Up Stairs","The CNN  journalist  who posted the video of President Trump helping polio survivor Mitch McConnell up the stairs, following their remarks to the press, will likely backfire, as most Americans will notice the gentle way that President Trump discreetly held Mitch McConnell s arm, as he helped him to navigate the stairs. For most Americans, this video will solidify what they already believe about him, that he is a generous and kind man and not the monster the media would like their followers to believe that he is. CNN political reporter Daniella Diaz sent a tweet on Monday pointing out that President Trump and Sen. Mitch McConnell locked hands while walking up stairs at the White House following their Rose Garden press conference. Diaz seemed to be mocking the Republican duo   but while followers quickly pointed out that the Kentucky senator is a polio survivor, the tweet remains on her feed nearly 24 hours later.

Why would you ask something that dumb? Huh? My job as a United States senator as a senator from Arizona which I was just reelected to. You think that I would somehow behave in a way that I would block everything just because of some personal disagreement? That s a dumb question. Doocy s question really isn t too far off. We could begin with McCain s shocking vote for keeping Obamacare. Since then, the war of words between President Trump and McCain has only gotten more heated.OUR LATEST ON THE FEUD BETWEEN THE SENATOR AND THE PRESIDENT:President Trump hit back at Senator John McCain in a pointed statement that should make it clear that Trump isn t playing around with globalist RINO McCain anymore. You can t blame Trump because McCain just keeps nipping at his heels with swipes trying to undermine Trump s policies. RINO McCain famously demolished the latest effort to repeal and replace Obamacare in a dramatic show during the vote. McCain came onto the floor at the end of the Senate vote and voted no with a dramatic thumbs down motion.McCain has been at odds with Trump since Trump questioned McCains status as a war hero. It seems McCain has had it out for Trump ever since.Another bombshell on the McCain/Trump feud hypothesizes that the Trump Dossier could have come from McCain.The latest slam to Trump happened just last night  during a speech McCain gave. McCain called out Trump s nationalism but it didn t take long for Trump to respond:President Donald Trump on Tuesday issued a warning shot after Republican Sen. John McCain questioned  half-baked, spurious nationalism  in America s foreign policy.Trump said in a radio interview with WMAL in Washington that  people have to be careful because at some point I fight back.

McCain has always been touted as a war hero for decades but many of the men who served when he did have raised questions about McCain.McCain, a former Navy pilot who spent 5  years in a Vietnam prisoner of war camp and is battling brain cancer, offered a simple response to Trump:  I have faced tougher adversaries. In Philadelphia on Monday night, the six-term Republican senator from Arizona received an award for a lifetime of service and sacrifice to the country. In addition to recalling his more than two decades of military service and his imprisonment during the war, McCain took a moment to go a step further than the night s other speakers, who lamented what many described as a fractured political climate.MCCAIN S GLOBALIST WORD SALAD: To abandon the ideals we have advanced around the globe, to refuse the obligations of international leadership for the sake of some half-baked, spurious nationalism cooked up by people who would rather find scapegoats than solve problems,  he said,  is as unpatriotic as an attachment to any other tired dogma of the past that Americans consigned to the ash heap of history.

"BREAKING BOMBSHELL: Hillary, Obama, Holder, Comey, Mueller and 2 Key Officials Leading Trump-Russia Collusion Investigation Are All Linked To HUGE Secret Russian NUCLEAR Deal","Yesterday, the founder of Wikileaks, Julian Assange sent a cryptic tweet that contained a series of number and letters. Someone out there knows what that code means, and they are very likely shaking in their boots today.4767 5774 6a7a 4d6c 6330 666b 314a 3453 0000 0907 84b4 f787 7616 86f7 a737 5707 5736  Julian Assange   (@JulianAssange) October 15, 2017On another front, two writers from separate publications were set to publish what Sean Hannity was calling a  huge bombshell  story that was due to break today.Last night on Fox News  Hannity show, Sean Hannity warned that a huge bombshell would be breaking today. Sean told his audience that Circa News Sara Carter and The Hill s John Solomon have HUGE BREAKING NEWS. Hannity told his audience,  Let me put it this way, if I m Hillary or fake news, I won t be sleeping well tonight. Watch:.@seanhannity TICK TOCK Tonight Folks  Get ready @HillaryClinton  pic.twitter.com/PxbRCgyPwm  'GITMO' BAMA   (@President1Trump) October 17, 2017Well, John Solomon and Alison Spann s story did indeed break first thing today in The Hill, and it s a doozy. Will justice finally be delivered to these corrupt, anti-American, self-serving and lying players? Not providing information on a corruption scheme before the Russian uranium deal was approved by U.S. regulators and engage appropriate congressional committees has served to undermine U.S. national security interests by the very people charged with protecting them. The Russian efforts to manipulate our American political enterprise is breathtaking.    Former House Intelligence Chair Mike Rogers (R-MI)The Hill   Before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.They also obtained an eyewitness account   backed by documents   indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.The racketeering scheme was conducted  with the consent of higher level officials  in Russia who  shared the proceeds  from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.Rather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefitting Putin s commercial nuclear ambitions.The first decision occurred in October 2010, when the State Department and government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, giving Moscow control of more than 20 percent of America s uranium supply.When this sale was used by Trump on the campaign trail last year, Hillary Clinton s spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the State Department official who handled it said she  never intervened   on any [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] matter. In 2011, the administration gave approval for Rosatom s Tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants in a partnership with the United States Enrichment Corp. Before then, Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program. The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,  a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.The Obama administration s decision to approve Rosatom s purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015.That s when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.The Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal.But FBI, Energy Department and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the FBI, in fact, had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee s decision that Vadim Mikerin   the main Russian overseeing Putin s nuclear expansion inside the United States   was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.Then-Attorney General Eric Holder was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time the Uranium One deal was approved. Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn t comment.Mikerin was a director of Rosatom s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom s new American arm called Tenam.Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin  did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons   to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,  a November 2014 indictment stated.His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show. The investigation was ultimately supervised by then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, an Obama appointee who now serves as President Trump s deputy attorney general, and then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe, now the deputy FBI director under Trump, Justice Department documents show.On August 6, 2017,  The Washington Times questioned Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein s  fishing expedition  aimed at digging up dirt on President Trump in his investigation in the Trump-Russia investigation. The special counsel is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Justice, and we don t engage in fishing expeditions,  Mr. Rosenstein said on  Fox News Sunday. In his first Sunday show interview, Mr. Rosenstein added that special counsel Robert Mueller  understands and I understand the specific scope of the investigation and so, it s not a fishing expedition. Mr. Rosenstein s comments come amid reports citing unnamed sources that the investigation has expanded into Mr. Trump s finances unrelated to possible Russian interference in last year s election.Mr. Rosenstein played down the reports:  That s not anything that I ve said. That s not anything Director Mueller has said. We don t know who s saying it or how credible those sources are. Both men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible, but still unproven collusion between Russia and Donald Trump s campaign during the 2016 election.McCabe is under congressional and Justice Department inspector general investigation in connection with money his wife s Virginia state Senate campaign accepted in 2015 from now-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe at a time when McAuliffe was reportedly under investigation by the FBI.The connections to the current Russia case are many. The Mikerin probe began in 2009 when Robert Mueller, now the special counsel in charge of the Trump case, was still FBI director. And it ended in late 2015 under the direction of then-FBI Director James Comey, who Trump fired earlier this year.Bringing down a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme that had both compromised a sensitive uranium transportation asset inside the U.S. and facilitated international money laundering would seem a major feather in any law enforcement agency s cap.But the Justice Department and FBI took little credit in 2014 when Mikerin, the Russian financier and the trucking firm executives were arrested and charged.The only public statement occurred an entire year later when the Justice Department put out a little-noticed press release in August 2015, just days before Labor Day. The release noted that the various defendants had reached plea deals.The lack of fanfare left many key players in Washington with no inkling that a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme with serious national security implications had been uncovered.On Dec. 15, 2015, the Justice Department put out a release stating that Mikerin,  a former Russian official residing in Maryland was sentenced today to 48 months in prison  and ordered to forfeit more than $2.1 million.Ronald Hosko, who served as the assistant FBI director in charge of criminal cases when the investigation was underway, told The Hill he did not recall ever being briefed about Mikerin s case by the counterintelligence side of the bureau despite the criminal charges that were being lodged. I had no idea this case was being conducted,  a surprised Hosko said in an interview.Meanwhile, Julian Assange is jumping on the bandwagon, as he teases that he has a major announcement of his own that is coming soon Russian nuclear bribery investigation reveals that Russia routed millions to the Clintons https://t.co/ti7ycn7auf  Julian Assange   (@JulianAssange) October 17, 2017 ",politics,"Oct 17, 2017"

"ONE BRUTAL IMAGE Perfectly Captures The Truth About Hillarys Plans To Donate Weinsteins Campaign Contributions","A spokesperson for the Clinton Foundation claims the group will not return Weinstein s donations, which totaled between $100,000 and $250,000.Because oops! The Clinton Foundation has already spent the money. But don t worry, Harvey s dirty money went to very good causes supporting women and children. And we all know how much Bill loves to take care of women This image by cartoonist Antonio F.

The explanation comes after foundation board member Chelsea Clinton ducked questions about Weinstein s money from a DailyMail.com reporter while attending a Clinton Global Initiative University event at Northeastern University in Boston on Saturday.The former first daughter hustled out a side door after the event, evading a reporter as she rushed to her car surrounded by aides and security.The Clinton Foundation and a spokesperson for Hillary Clinton had previously declined to comment on the Weinstein matter.Organizations have been divided on whether to return money to Weinstein, who gave to numerous political and philanthropic causes over the years.

"WATCH: THE VIEWS WHOOPI GOLDBERG and Her Leftist Co-Hosts Get SCHOOLED By Meghan McCain For Defending Eminems Hateful Anti-Trump Rant","The View s Joy Behar was beaming after watching a clip of Eminem trashing President Trump at the BET awards, where he told his fans that if they support Trump, he doesn t need them to purchase his music. Behar suggested that Eminem was being brave because literally no one in Hollywood or the music industry has taken such a stand,  That s why you need to give him [Eminem] credit because very few people in the industry will go out and say,  I don t care if you don t support me. This is more important than, than my popularity.  I have never seen it, frankly.  Really Joy? What planet have you been living on for the past 2 years?Co-host Sonny Hostin told the adoring liberal crowd,  I was actually at the hair salon watching the BET awards and the salon just um, roared when that happened.   She went on to condemn Trump for using Twitter and other means of communication to express his conservative views and then told the excessively liberal panel that,  I just thought it was very brave. That s when Meghan McCain, who appeared to be silently seething, as she listened to these morons speak to viewers as though they re speaking to an audience who s been living on an alternate planet, or don t have any access to real news finally spoke up, saying,  Actually, It s more socially acceptable to be a liberal in Hollywood. That s when Whoopi lost it Whoopi made a complete fool of herself when she embarrassingly attempted to prove that Meghan McCain doesn t understand history and that communism in Hollywood was really a right-wing movement. Huh? Whoopi then doubled down and suggested in her condescending tone that a simple trip to Amazon to purchase a few books should help Meghan to understand the history of Hollywood, that of course, only Whoopi truly understands. Whoopi then embarrassed herself again when she tried to prove how many conservatives are working in Hollywood. The first example she used was comedian Tim Allen, whose top-rated show,  Last Man Standing  was just clearly canceled by ABC for political reasons. Whoopi then attempted to think of a second conservative actor and stumbled to finally land on Tom Selleck who hasn t acted in a major movie or television show for decades. Selleck s career peaked in the 1990 s. Outside of his occasional appearances on  Friends  as Monica s boyfriend, Selleck s career has been almost non-existent.Meghan tried to explain to the panel that liberals are treated horribly in Hollywood and that it s more socially acceptable to be a liberal in Hollywood than a conservative.  She said that she lived in Los Angeles and that she was never more harassed than when she was living there. Meghan told that cast that it s more popular to be an Obama and Hillary, and even Bernie supporter.Whoopi then embarrassed herself again, when she tried to convince the panel that Meghan s assertion that conservatives are blacklisted in Hollywood is ridiculous. Whoopi laughed and corrected McCain saying,  Except that all of the conservatives in Hollywood are working. They re the ones that are working.   She tried to recall some examples of conservatives working in Hollywood.  The first example she used was comedian Tim Allen, whose top-rated show,  Last Man Standing  was recently canceled by ABC for his political views.

According to press reports, Hitler had a portrait of Henry Ford on his office wall and a copy of The International Jew, published by Ford, on his desk.   Crains Business Detroit Should anyone be shocked by a Sheriff s decision to not want to support a car brand, after their decision to openly support a movement started to create hate and distrust for our law enforcement? The Bossier Parish (La.) Sheriff s Office is boycotting its local Ford dealership because of Ford Motor Company s support for protests of the National Anthem by National Football League (NFL) players at games, Sheriff Julian Whittington announced Wednesday.Sheriff Whittington sent a letter to Hixson Ford of Alexandria notifying the dealership that his office would no longer purchase Ford vehicles for  as long as Ford sides with those who have no regard for the men and women who protect and serve this great nation : Yes, the NFL players have a right to protest as they deem necessary, but we, the Bossier Sheriff s Office and the taxpayers of Bossier Parish have a right to spend our money elsewhere,  Whittington says in his letter posted on the office s Facebook page. It is my hope that this letter will cause you to encourage Ford Motor Co. to change their advertising choice and cease to support the NFL with advertising dollars until the NFL leadership demands its players show proper respect for our nation s colors.  After the letter to Hixson Automotive was received by Dallas L. Hixson, the Sheriff discussed the issue with Mr. Hixson, the Sheriff s office told CNSNews.com. Mr. Hixson informed Sheriff Whittington that he was not aware of Ford Motor Company s support for NFL players who wish to protest during the National Anthem or during the game.Hixson told Sheriff Whittington that such a stance concerns him as well, and he will be taking the Sheriff s letter with him to Detroit to present to Ford Motor Co. leadership in the near future.Sheriff Whittington says he is sending copies of the letter to each of the state s 63 other sheriffs, as well as both the national and Louisiana sheriffs  associations.National Sheriffs  Association (NSA) Executive Director Jonathan Thompson tells CNSNews.com that NSA has received the letter and that sheriffs have both the authority and obligation to authorize, or decline, purchases based on the best interests of law enforcement and their communities: Sheriffs have the obligation to decide which products they authorize for bids, procurements and purchases. They choose, based upon a variety of requirements and capabilities, but also whom they believe is best able to support the broad needs of law enforcement and the communities they protect  Since 2016, the Bossier Sheriff s Office has spent $747,132 and purchased 29 vehicles patronizing Hixon Autoplex. The Sheriff s Office provided the following breakdown to CNSNews.com:In 2016, BSO purchased 14 vehicles from Hixson Autoplex, costing $346,519.50. They included:One 2015 Ford F-150 Two 2015 Ford F-250 Six 2017 Ford Police Interceptor One 2017 Ford Explorer Three 2016 Ford Taurus One 2017 Ford Taurus In 2017, BSO purchased 15 vehicles from Hixson Autoplex, costing $400,612.50. They included:Fifteen 2017 Ford Police Interceptor Ford Motor Company issued a statement in late September supporting the right of the players to protest the National Anthem at NFL games, Bloomberg reports: Ford, for example, said the automaker would  respect individuals  rights to express their views, even if they are not ones we share.

"REPUBLICANS WILL NEVER WATCH Arrogant JIMMY KIMMEL Again After What He Just Said About Them ","Apparently, Kimmel s okay with throwing half of his audience away over his uncontrollable hate for Donald Trump and his supporters. The big question is, will parent company ABC be okay with Kimmel insulting, and driving 50% of his audience away?Late-night comedian Jimmy Kimmel said he would perform the same emotionally-charged monologues about healthcare and gun violence  again in a heartbeat,  despite a drastic reduction in Republican viewership of his show. Three years ago, I was equally liked by Republicans and Democrats,  Kimmel told CBS   Sunday Morning  of  Jimmy Kimmel Live!  which has aired on ABC since 2003.  And then Republican numbers went way down, like 30 percent, or whatever. And you know, as a talk show host, that s not ideal but I would do it again in a heartbeat. Kimmel earned high praise and sharp rebukes for his foray into the healthcare debate in September, an issue that became particularly important to the comic after his six-month-old son Billy was born with a rare congenital heart defect.He also garnered similar reactions when he choked up during a monologue imploring Congress to act on gun control in the wake of the Las Vegas massacre earlier in October.Critics like conservative commentator Ben Shapiro have slammed Kimmel for parading as a  moral arbiter. I m not. I mean, I agree with him. I m nobody s moral arbiter,  Kimmel told CBS.  You don t have to watch the show. You don t have to listen to what I say. A defiant Kimmel added that he doesn t say  I don t mind  because he preferred  everyone with a television to watch the show. But if they re so turned off by my opinion on healthcare and gun violence then, I don t know, I probably wouldn t want to have a conversation with them anyway,  he continued.  Not good riddance, but riddance.   Washington ExaminerKimmel has been known to mock Trump over comments he made to Billy Bush several years ago about a woman in the privacy of the bus they were traveling on together. Jimmy Kimmel never counted, however, on this video resurfacing where he asks random women to  feel  what s in his pants and then tell the TV audience what it is. Pretty funny, huh?

CONSUMER CONFIDENCE SOARS To Level Americans Havent Seen Since Another Republican Was President&MEDIA SILENT","Prior to the 2016 election (Oct  16) consumer confidence measured by the University of Michigan was indexed at 87.2 Today that same confidence rating is 101.1 A stunning 15.9% increase. Similarly, consumer expectations were indexing 76.8 in October 2016 and now stand at 91.3, an increase of 18.9%.   Conservative TreehouseBusiness Insider   US consumers haven t been this optimistic about the economy since the start of 2004, according to a survey conducted by the University of Michigan.The consumer-sentiment index registered a preliminary October reading of 101.1, a monthly report showed Friday.The data suggest that consumer spending will likely continue to support the economy through at least mid-2018, at which time this economic expansion would become the second-longest since the 19th century. US economic growth in the second quarter rose to a two-year high on stronger consumer and business spending, a late-September report showed.The surge in optimism  reflects an unmistakable sense among consumers that economic prospects are now about as good as could be expected,  said Richard Curtin, the chief economist of the survey. This  as good as it gets  outlook is supported by a moderation in the expected pace of growth in both personal finances and the overall economy, accompanied by a growing sense that, even with this moderation, it would still mean the continuation of good economic times.

"WATCH: FORMER CHILD ACTOR Tried To Call Out Powerful Hollywood Pedophiles on The View&Barbara Walters and Female Co-Host Shamed Him: Youre damaging an entire industry!","Child actor Corey Feldman appeared on The View in 2013 to talk about his book that exposed some of the richest and most powerful people in the business [Hollywood], who are pedophiles that prey on young actors. Corey s brave admission of his experiences in Hollywood should have been treated as a public service announcement for parents who had child actors working in Hollywood, as he was giving them a  heads up  to take the extra steps to protect them. Instead, he was shamed Feldman appeared in a 2103 episode of The View where Barbara Walters and Star Jones went out of their way to discredit and shut him up. I m saying there are people that were the people that did this to both me and Corey [Haim] that are still working. They re still out there, and that are some of the richest most powerful people in this business. Walters tried to interupt, but Feldman continued,  And they do not want me saying what I am saying right now. Walters asked Feldman,  Are you saying they are pedophiles  and that they are still in this business?  Feldman replied,  Yes. Feldman went on to say,  They don t want me here right now. They want me dead! Star Jones quickly jumped in to try to shut Feldman up so he doesn t scare parents who want their kids in the industry.Feldman clarified, that he s just warning parents to  be careful what you wish for. Don t go into it with naivety.  Instead of considering Feldman s warning, that may be of interest to parents who have children in the industry, Walters interrupted him to admonish him,  You re damaging an entire industry! Feldman apologized,  I m sorry. After several years of being shamed by his peers and high-profile women in the industry like Barbara Walters, child actor Corey Feldman may finally find someone who will finally take him seriously, now that Harvey Weinstein has been exposed.Cernovich   The recent exposure of serial sexual predator and Hollywood Democrat kingpin Harvey Weinstein raises, even more, questions than it answers.In a now famous photo, Weinstein can be seen grabbing young actress Emma Watson in a compromising position.While the public controversy currently centers around Weinstein s sexual abuse of power over young women, the question remains   how young were Weinstein s victims?Former child actor Corey Feldman has publicly stated that  I was molested and passed around,  while discussing how in Hollywood adult males in the industry would pass young stars  back and forth to each other.  Feldman revealed that his co-star Corey Haim was raped at 11-years-old.Actor Elijah Wood confirmed Feldman s claims in May 2016, describing Hollywood as a den of  vipers  in an interview, and saying  If you can imagine it, it s probably happened. Wood said he was protected from abuse by his mother, who didn t let him go to Hollywood parties, but he said other young child actors were regularly  preyed upon  by those in power.Wood also compared Hollywood s sexual predators with known pedophile and English TV personality Jimmy Savile. You all grew up with Savile,  Wood said.  Jesus, it must have been devastating. Clearly something major was going on in Hollywood. It was all organized.

"COLLEGE QB Kneed Out Of Anger Over Trumps Remarks About NFL Players Disrespecting Our Flag&Immediately Gets Bad News From Coach","He was given the option to kneel in protest before the game, but it was more important for him to take a stand against our President for bravely taking a public stance in defense of our flag and for our veterans A liberal arts college in eastern Pennsylvania cut its backup quarterback after he knelt during the national anthem.Albright College in Reading cut Gyree Durante from its team after he took a knee during the Star-Spangled Banner, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.According to the paper, the school promised consequences if players took actions different than those made in a special agreement.The team s  leadership council  decided that the squad would take a knee during the pregame coin toss, but stand for the national anthem. I knew the consequences. I knew that if I took a knee, that there would be a good chance that I would be kicked off. I didn t like the whole taking a knee during the coin toss, I just thought it defeated the whole purpose of kneeing for the anthem. I get the whole team unity thing, but at the end of the day, I also thought that we should be allowed to be individuals, and express ourselves. The week before, I was watching NFL football, and I happened to see some of the remarks by President Trump about, uh, regarding NFL players taking a knee during the anthem, and he said that they should be fired, they should be kicked off and things like that. I already knew that it was an issue with, all of the racial and social injustice and you know, police brutality among African Americans and things like that.  But when I heard the President say something about it, and, it was very negative, it just kinda struck a nerve with me and it made me think, if this is how the President feels,  then Idefinitelyy need to take a need and protest this.  (Go here for video)After Durante knelt, the Division III Lions went on to lose to Delaware Valley University, from nearby Doylestown, by 41-6.Durante s name was wiped from the team roster and a college spokesperson said in a statement obtained by ESPN that the Norristown, Pa. native was dismissed for his actions.

Feminists think Starbucks has a special drink that s racist and they re going after the coffee house because of it. No, we didn t make this up. Just listen to Tucker Carlson s dismay at how ridiculous this is:WEIRDEST CLAIM EVER: PUMPKIN SPICE LATTE = WHITE SUPREMACY: Pumpkin spice just doesn t taste as good when you add a shot of racism,  a feminist leader explained as the fall flavor began to pop up in coffee shops around the country. This is a shockingly weird claim, but it shouldn t be surprising.In an editorial published last month, we wrote about the Left s effort to broaden the boundaries of concepts such as white supremacy and racism in a way that impugns the conduct of well-meaning people. Now, a feminist nonprofit is running a campaign to convince festive imbibers of Pumpkin Spice Lattes they re unknowingly boosting the cause of white supremacy.The co-founder of UltraViolet issued the  shot of racism  statement Sept. 6. I knew Starbucks had a secret menu, but the baristas must really be keeping these racism shots on the down low.A social media post from the group informed readers:  That favorite fall drink of yours is funding rent payments to white supremacy. Given the severity of the campaign s language, one may assume profits from sales of Starbucks  beloved PSLs are being surreptitiously redirected to the Klan or neo-Nazi groups. In fact, UltraViolet s actual complaint is that a couple of Starbucks  24,000 locations happen to be in properties owned by the Trump Organization.According to UltraViolet s logic, by patronizing any of Starbucks  thousands of stores, average consumers of the signature fall beverage are directly boosting the cause of white supremacy.

People looked at your name and your legacy more than they looked at your gender. Clinton answered in her usual delusional way by laying out the amount of support she THINKS she received and then blaming former FBI director James Comey and the Russians for her defeat: That doesn t explain why I led all the way through, why I won the primary by 4 million votes, why I was winning, we had a great convention,  she said.  I was thought to have won all three debates. That doesn t explain it, Matt, so that s why I had to really dig deep. And, yes, I take responsibility. Obviously, there were things I must have been able to do differently in order to have won,  Clinton continued.  But at the end, there was this really perfect storm, and so you had the Comey letter and you had the enormous impact of the Russian theft of emails, the release of them by WikiLeaks, basically now a part of the Russian intelligence apparatus, and the weaponization of that. These were all new phenomena. So you re still blaming others more than yourself?  Frei asked I DON T BLAME OTHERS ??? No, I take ultimate responsibility, I don t blame others, but I think it s important that people understand what happened,  Clinton said.  It easy to say,  You know she wasn t a good candidate.

It is stunning that the FBI  found  these Clinton-Lynch tarmac records only after we caught the agency hiding them in another lawsuit.    Judicial Watch Tom Fitton.FBI hid 30 documents related to Clinton-Lynch tarmac meeting. https://t.co/8JJTDR4G47  Real Jack (@RealJack) October 14, 2017BUSTED! THANK GOODNESS FOR JUDICIAL WATCH!Judicial Watch was informed yesterday by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) that the FBI has located 30 pages of documents related to the June 27, 2016, tarmac meeting between former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former President Bill Clinton, and proposes non-exempt material be produced no later than November 30, 2017 (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of Justice (No. 1:16-cv-02046)).The new documents are being sent to Judicial Watch in response to a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed after the Justice Department failed to comply with a July 7, 2016, FOIA request seeking the following:All FD-302 forms prepared pursuant to the Federal Bureau of Investigation s investigation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s use of a private e-mail server during her tenure. All records of communications between any agent, employee, or representative of the Federal Bureau of Investigation regarding, concerning, or related to the aforementioned investigation. This request includes, but is not limited to, any related communications with any official, employee, or representative of the Department of Justice, the Executive Office of the President, the Democratic National Committee, and/or the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton.All records related to the meeting between Attorney General Lynch and former President Bill Clinton on June 27, 2016. The FBI originally informed Judicial Watch they did not locate any records related to the tarmac meeting. However, in a related case, the Justice Department located emails in which Justice Department officials communicated with the FBI and wrote that they had communicated with the FBI. As a result, by letter dated August 10, 2017, from the FBI stated,  Upon further review, we subsequently determined potentially responsive documents may exist. As a result, your [FOIA] request has been reopened (Surprisingly, the Trump Justice Department refuses to disclose the talking points developed by the Obama Justice Department to help it respond to press inquiries about the controversial June 27, 2016, tarmac meeting between Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton at Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport.)On June 27, 2016, Attorney General Loretta Lynch met privately with former President Bill Clinton on board a parked private plane at Sky Harbor International Airport in Phoenix, Arizona. The meeting occurred during the then-ongoing investigation of Mrs. Clinton s email server, and mere hours before the Benghazi report was released publicly involving both Mrs. Clinton and the Obama administration. Judicial Watch filed a request on June 30 that the U.S. Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General investigate that meeting. The FBI is out of control. It is stunning that the FBI  found  these Clinton-Lynch tarmac records only after we caught the agency hiding them in another lawsuit,  stated Judicial Watch Tom Fitton.  Judicial Watch will continue to press for answers about the FBI s document games in court. In the meantime, the FBI should stop the stonewall and release these new records immediately. This case has also forced the FBI to release to the public the FBI s Clinton investigative file, although more than half of the records remain withheld. The FBI has also told Judicial Watch that it anticipates completing the processing of these materials by July 2018.There is significant controversy about whether the FBI and Obama Justice Department investigation gave Clinton and other witnesses and potential targets preferential treatment.The Obama administration extended numerous immunity agreements, including: Clinton s former Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills; John Bentel, former director of the State Department s Office of Information Resources Management; Heather Samuelson, Clinton s executive assistant; Brian Pagliano, an IT employee at the State Department who serviced the Clinton non-government server; and an employee at Platt River Networks, the company that maintained it. It is not clear whether Hillary Clinton received some type of immunity.In 2015, a political action committee run by McAuliffe, a close friend and political supporter of Bill and Hillary Clinton, donated nearly $500,000 to Jill McCabe, wife of McCabe, who was then running for the Virginia State Senate. Also, the Virginia Democratic Party, over which McAuliffe had significant influence, donated an additional $207,788 to the Jill McCabe campaign. In July 2015, Andrew McCabe was in charge of the FBI s Washington, DC, field office, which provided personnel resources to the Clinton email probe. Judicial Watch has several lawsuits about this McCabe/FBI/Clinton scandal.Via: Judicial Watch ",politics,"Oct 13, 2017"
"LOL!

She was referring to the Access Hollywood tape leaked during the campaign where Donald Trump was heard boasting about  grabbing women by the p****y  in 2005.Mrs. Clinton is in the UK to promote her hand-wringing book about losing the presidential election.She told Marr:  I was really shocked and appalled because I ve known him through politics as many Democrats have.Team player Hillary Clinton tries to deflect attention from the millions of dollars Harvey Weinstein raised for her recent failed presidential campaign by reminding reporters that he also donated to Obama and,  for people (she forgot to mention that he ONLY funded DEMOCRAT people) who have run for office in the United States. He s been a supporter   he s been a funder for all of us, for Obama, for me, for people who have run for office in the United States.  So it was just disgusting and the stories that have come out are heartbreaking. But I think that it s important that we not just focus on him and whatever consequences flow from these stories about his behavior but that we recognize this kind of behavior cannot be tolerated anywhere, whether it s in entertainment, politics. After all, we have someone admitting to being a sexual assaulter in the Oval Office. There has to be a recognition that we must stand against this kind of action that is so sexist and misogynistic.  And asked about allegations of sexual misconduct leveled at her husband and former president, Bill Clinton, she said:  That has all been litigated. That was the subject of a huge investigation in the late 90s and there were conclusions drawn. That was clearly in the past. It is something that has to be taken seriously, for anyone not just in entertainment. The really sad part of the campaign was how this horrific tape, what he said about women in the past what he said about women during the campaign, was discounted by a lot of voters.   DMLOL! Hillary.

Korean EMP Attack Would Kill 90% of All Americans","While fecklessness towards the emerging North Korean threat characterized the Clinton and Bush  43 administrations, we find ourselves needlessly exposed to its present magnitude in no small measure because Obama s so-called strategic patience was characterized by inaction on two, vital fronts: advancing the U.S. missile defense capabilities and protecting the grid against electromagnetic pulse and other perils.Barack Obama and his subordinates brought to office a visceral enmity towards missile defense, born of an ideological attachment to the obsolete Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty with the Soviet Union, which prevented the United States from having any effective anti-missile systems. While George W. Bush formally withdrew us from the ABM Treaty in 2002, the capabilities of such defenses as have been put into place have been deliberately limited   so much so that they were reportedly not up to the task of shooting down the ballistic missile Pyongyang fired over Japan last week.Team Obama was convinced that it would rid the world of nuclear weapons and so declined to take seriously, let alone do anything appreciable about, the danger that one or more detonated outside the atmosphere over the United States could destroy our most critical of critical infrastructures: the electric grid. Late in his presidency, Mr. Obama did evince concern about a similar, nation-ending effect being caused by intense solar storms, but did little to make the grid resilient against that source of destructive electromagnetic pulses, either.   Frank J. Gaffney, Jr., former Assistant Secretary of Defense for the Reagan administration, and President of the Center for Security PolicyWashington Examiner   Congress was warned Thursday that North Korea is capable of attacking the U.S. today with a nuclear EMP bomb that could indefinitely shut down the electric power grid and kill 90 percent of  all Americans  within a year.At a House hearing, experts said that North Korea could easily employ the  doomsday scenario  to turn parts of the U.S. to ashes.In calling on the Pentagon and President Trump to move quickly to protect the grid, the experts testified that an explosion of a high-altitude nuclear bomb delivered by a missile or satellite  could be to shut down the U.S. electric power grid for an indefinite period, leading to the death within a year of up to 90 percent of all Americans. Two members of the former congressional EMP commission said the threat to the U.S. has never been higher, in part because of the current high level of saber-rattling by both sides and North Korea s surprising display over the past six months of its ability to deliver on its threats. With the development of small nuclear arsenals and long-range missiles by new, radical U.S. adversaries, beginning with North Korea, the threat of a nuclear EMP attack against the U.S. becomes one of the few ways that such a country could inflict devastating damage to the United States. It is critical, therefore, that the U.S. national leadership address the EMP threat as a critical and existential issue, and give a high priority to assuring the leadership is engaged and the necessary steps are taken to protect the country from EMP,  the experts told a House Homeland Security subcommittee.Watch the discussion about the threat of an EMP attack on the United States with congressional members here: ",politics,"Oct 13, 2017"

"MYSTERIOUS TWITTER ACCOUNT: NFLs Goodell Gets Help From Shocking Source","Well, this is embarrassing! The NFL commissioner was getting help from a helicopter wife who set up a fake twitter account to counter any negative press on her husband. It s pretty shocking because his wife is former Fox analyst Jane Skinner Goodell who should know better because she s in the news business. Did she really think people wouldn t find out who was constantly tweeting support for Goodell?Roger Goodell s wife set up a secret Twitter account to clap back at the NFL commissioner s detractors, according to the Wall Street Journal.The Twitter account, under the name  Jones smith,  has no followers, no profile picture and has been virtually dormant for long periods since its creation in 2014.@forargument is no longer active as of Thursday afternoon but according to the report, it was owned and operated by Goodell s wife, Jane Skinner Goodell, and often clashed with sports media outlets that produced content critical of the commissioner.Under the fake name  Jones Smith,  the account defended Goodell on several issues including the NFL s recent handling of national anthem protests.An example of the mysterious account standing up for Goodell took place earlier this month in response to an ESPN story chronicling the chaos that swept across the league when President Donald Trump went to war with anthem protesters. Reads like a press release from players  union. You can do better reporting. (D Smith sounds like D Trump with the inaccurate firebombs),  @forargument tweeteed to ESPN writer Seth Wickersham. D Smith  was likely a reference to NFLPA head DeMaurice Smith.Goodell s wife, who is a former broadcast journalist with Fox News, has also taken aim at WSJ columnist Jason Gay and other sportswriters, according to the Journal.The Journal said it traced a series of clues back to Mrs. Goodell, including how the account in question followed four accounts associated with their twin daughters  high school.Goodell s wife coming to his digital defense is nothing new in sports and media, though it is embarrassing. Thin-skinned Kevin Durant was recently accused of running a fake Twitter account to take on negative news and opinion about him on social media.Wives and girlfriends of pro athletes have never been shy about standing up for their famous husbands online. From Kate Upton sticking up for Justin Verlander not winning a Cy Young last year to Miko Grimes cheerleading for her husband, cornerback Brent Grimes, on social media, plenty of athletes have gotten a digital assist from their significant others. However, those women did not hide behind a fake Twitter account to make their feelings known.Goodell has earned plenty of negative press in his more than 10 years running the NFL, including the league s handling of domestic violence and concussion issues, Deflategate, and most recently, the anthem protests.Just be nice about what you say about him on Twitter, because his wife might clap back at you.Read more: NYDN",politics,"Oct 13, 2017"
"GAME ON! California State Senator to Enter U.S. Senate Race Against Dianne Feinstein","Senator Dianne Feinstein recently announced she would be running again She s 84-years old! Her career in politics has been a very lucrative undertaking. How could she possibly give that up? The power and the money are just too hard to pass up for retirement.

Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.) is signaling his intent to enter the race for the Senate seat she has held since 1992.California Democratic state senate president Kevin de Le n will throw his hat into the ring to challenge Feinstein in the 2018 race, according to three sources who spoke to CNN. The 84-year-old senator announced Monday she would run for reelection, causing consternation on the progressive left even as she tried to get out ahead of de Le n.In the state senate, de Le n represents Los Angeles and has helped pass measures directed at President Donald Trump, positioning himself as one of the president s fiercest critics. The California state legislature has opposed Trump s agenda by becoming a so-called sanctuary state, as well as trying to force him to release his tax returns and even passing a resolution calling for him to apologize for  racist and bigoted behavior. Feinstein, however, took criticism from the left in August for expressing the hope that Trump would change to be more cooperative with Democrats. I just hope he has the ability to learn and to change, and if he does, he can be a good president,  she said, receiving boos from the San Francisco audience. She later said she is  under no illusion that it s likely to happen and will continue to oppose his policies. De Le n will likely be one of multiple contenders for Feinstein s seat. A source said Democratic mega-donor and environmentalist Tom Steyer is  very much looking at the Senate race,  and in a letter Wednesday he also called on Democrats to impeach Trump.California has an open primary in which the top two vote-getters, regardless of party, face off in the general election. The primary will be held on June 5, 2018.FEINSTEIN RECENTLY OPENED HER MOUTH AND PROVED SHE S OUT OF TOUCH WITH MOST AMERICANS: Senator Dianne Feinstein opened her mouth and proved she s out of touch with most of us.

Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.) couldn t name any laws in an interview airing Sunday that might have prevented last week s massacre in Las Vegas.NBC host Chuck Todd asked Feinstein what laws could have prevented the massacre if she had her way with writing all laws. Let me ask you this: give me the slate of laws that if you could wave your wand and have enacted that could have prevented Vegas?  Todd said. Well, I don t know. I would have to take a good look at that and really study it,  Feinstein said.  I m not sure there is any set of laws that could have prevented it. ",politics,"Oct 12, 2017"

He signed an executive order that would allow Americans to purchase insurance across state lines. The time has come to take action to IMPROVE access, INCREASE choices, and LOWER COSTS for HEALTHCARE!  https://t.co/mz5fdveTVh pic.twitter.com/dDZLsKuNSe  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 12, 2017Congressional Democrats said Thursday that President Trump s executive order to relax insurance rules is the latest evidence of Republican  sabotage  against Obamacare.The president signed the order that directs federal agencies to examine regulations that would make it easier for people to band together to get  association health plans  and buy more short-term insurance. Democrats quickly criticized the order as a back door to attack protections for people with pre-existing conditions and increase  junk  insurance plans.

"BREAKING NEWS: N. AMERICAN FAMILY Held Hostage During Obama Presidency RESCUED In Pakistan: This is a country that did not respect us, this is a country that respects us now [VIDEO]","In 2017, Kelli O Brien, the aunt of Joshua Boyle spoke publicly about the kidnapping of her nephew and his wife Caitlan Boyle who expresses her disappointment over the lack of response from Prime Minister Trudeau. Interestingly enough, Trudeau was visiting President Trump when Trump announced that he would soon be announcing some very good news would be forthcoming regarding the captured family s status.TODAY, Boyle and Coleman s families got some very good news! More winning An American woman, her Canadian husband, and their three children have been freed from captivity by Pakistani security forces, nearly five years after being taken hostage by the Taliban in Afghanistan.The initial word came from a Pakistani Army statement and was confirmed by US officials.The couple, American Caitlan Coleman, 31, and her American husband, Joshua Boyle, 33, were kidnapped by the Taliban in 2012 while they were traveling as tourists in Afghanistan and were held in captivity since.Coleman was pregnant when she was kidnapped. The couple had two more children born in captivity.Here is a video showing Joshua Boyle and his wife Caitlin Coleman speaking to the camera while in captivity in January 2017: In a statement, the Pakistani Army said US intelligence agencies had been tracking the hostages and shared intelligence with Pakistan when the family was moved to the country. US officials confirmed there was intelligence about their location in recent days that was shared with the Pakistanis. The operation by Pakistani forces, based on actionable intelligence from US authorities was successful; all hostages were recovered safe and sound and are being repatriated to the country of their origin,  the statement said.  The success underscores the importance of timely intelligence sharing and Pakistan s continued commitment towards fighting this menace through cooperation between two forces against a common enemy. It is possible that the successful recovery of the family was what was being referenced Wednesday when President Donald Trump told a crowd in Pennsylvania that  something happened today where a country that totally disrespected us called with some very, very important news. Trump did not disclose what country or any details involved but said  one of my generals came in and they said, you know, I have to tell you, a year ago they would have never done that. This is a country that did not respect us, this is a country that respects us now. The world is starting to respect us again, believe me,  Trump said appearing to reference Pakistan and that country s role in bringing about the recovery of the four hostages.

"VAN JONES Tells Mad Liberals To Go Hug Trump Voters in Appalachia To Win Elections [Video]","CNN political commentator Van Jones on Wednesday visited ABC s  The View,  where he criticized fellow liberals for being  mad at every single person  who voted for President Donald Trump. Jones tells the women that the Democrats need to make their tent bigger to include  folks in Appalachia Really? He goes on to say that they ve been embracing Muslims and other minorities but need to include the  miner with black lung Huh??? Basically, he s saying the Democrats are willing to toss their remaining policies to wh*re themselves out for votes any votes they can get from any warm body they can drag to the polls. Is anyone else out there as offended by this as we are?Jones first argued that, while the tent of the Democratic Party is diverse, it is not as inclusive as it could be. Right now I don t see Democrats looking at the situation and saying, you know what, maybe we drew our circle too small,  Jones said.  I love that we re hugging LGBT and Muslims and all the people who usually don t get a hug. We re hugging them, but maybe we need a bigger hug, and include some of those folks in Appalachia. That s exactly what the DNC chair said,  co-host Sunny Hostin insisted.  We had Tom Perez on the show, and that s exactly what he said. They are trying to do that,  co-host Joy Behar affirmed. Listen, there may be some leaders who are. Unfortunately, and I have to be honest I get in trouble because I m honest,  Jones said. I know you do,  Hostin interjected. When I listen to liberals, when they re not on TV trying to make it sound good, we re still in grief; we re still mad,  Jones said.  And we re not just mad at Trump, who we should be mad at. We re mad at every single person who voted for Trump, even people who have no jobs, even coal miners who have black lung disease and who are dying and Democrats don t have anything to say about it for years. Behar and co-host Whoopi Goldberg interrupted Jones to take issue with the idea that liberals are mad at Trump voters, asking Jones specifically who he was talking about. Jones explained his point of view comes from conversations with liberals. In my conversations with liberals, it s like  they,   those  Trump voters,  them.   I don t understand how those people could ever do that.  In America, we don t have to agree. We have to try to understand,  he said.Via: WFB",politics,"Oct 11, 2017"
"LAURA INGRAHAM: GOP Senators In Private Meeting Laughed out loud at the idea that Trumps border wall would ever be built","During a private meeting of the most senior Republican senators, GOP leaders  laughed out loud at the idea that Trump s border wall would ever be built. The explosive revelation comes from Laura Ingraham s new book, Billionaire at the Barricades: The Populist Revolution from Reagan to Trump.Ingraham reports that her source  was there in the room  when it happened and that the sordid episode is  a reminder that the populist movement that delivered Trump into office must remain vigilant and keep the heat on the GOP Establishment. The bestselling author and new Fox News primetime host argues that Republicans will pay an enormous political price if the GOP Establishment succeeds in torpedoing President Trump s border wall. Mark these words: If a wall a physical wall is not erected along our southern border, the president and his party will pay a severe political price,  writes Ingraham. She added:  Like George Bush s promise to  Read [his] lips: no new taxes,  the promise of a border wall was a searing pledge to the American people. Billionaire at the Barricades also dismantles arguments against the cost of erecting the border wall.The notion that Congress can t find $25 billion the higher end estimated cost of building the wall in our nearly $4 trillion annual budget is absurd. Democrats have never met a spending or building project they didn t like. But now all of a sudden they re fiscal hawks? Get real.

The DNC s response to the Harvey Weinstein matter is shockingly bad   even by Washington standards,  Alexandra Smith of the conservative opposition research firm America Rising said.  Donating  a mere 10 percent of the entire Weinstein contribution to another left-leaning political action committee is a complete embarrassment. The mission statement of EMILY s List is:  We elect pro-choice Democratic women to office.  Emerge America adds ethnic diversity to that same basic mission, proclaiming its intent  to increase the number of Democratic women leaders.  Higher Heights goal is to help black women get elected; the Center for Responsive Politics notes that it gives exclusively to Democrats.Some Democratic politicians are donating money received from Weinstein to nonprofits helping victims of sexual violence, while others have remained silent on the matter.

Weinstein donated along with a number of other notable names, like Tom Hanks, Barbra Streisand, Michael Douglas, Ron Howard, Norman Lear and Steven Spielberg.WaPo also reported that Clinton s defense fund collected $2.2 million in its first six months, tapping into the  resentment against  the attorney that investigated Clinton as to whether he committed perjury or obstructed justice in a sexual assault lawsuit.

"WHOA! WATCH Former Teen Hollywood Actor: I Can Tell You The #1 Problem In Hollywood Was and IS and ALWAYS Will Be Pedophilia","Are we finally watching the end times for Hollywood celebrities, who have been worshipped like golden idols by Americans who believe them to be flawless and infallible human beings? Is the morally superior facade of Hollywood actors like Meryl Streep and Gwenyth Paltrow, who admonish and berate Americans that would dare to support President Trump, while sucking up to serial sexual abuser Harvey Weinstein? What about actress Ashley Judd who America watched while she wore her p*ssy hat, go off on an insane rant at the Women s March in DC, over Donald Trump s remarks about a woman, to another man, during a private conversation, while she hid the ACTUAL sexual assault that was allegedly committed against her by mega-Democrat donor Harvey Weinstein. Judd claims she was asked to meet Weinstein for a breakfast meeting at the Peninsula Beverly Hills Hotel some 20 years ago. She said the meeting turned into him inviting her up to his hotel room and claimed he asked to give her a massage and watch him shower. A disgusting audio of Weinstein begging an Italian model to watch him shower in his hotel room was just released today. You can find the story and the audio HERE.Gwenyth Paltrow claims that she was also sexually abused by Harvey Weinstein when she was 22 years old. So that was 23 years ago, why the silence until now? How many countless women could have been saved by Paltrow or Judd if they came out and pressed charges against Weinstein decades ago? Neither one of them has any trouble publicly bashing Trump. But, oh yeah, bashing Trump is a resume enhancer in Hollywood, while ignoring a Hollywood producer who s a sick pervert, is perfectly acceptable, as long as he s the one who signs your enormous paychecks.Gwyneth Paltrow claims that she was sexually harassed by Harvey Weinstein when she was just 22: https://t.co/ZtZlJFXZ6z pic.twitter.com/oqRm7WSO9q  E!

Feldman revealed that his co-star Corey Haim was raped at 11-years-old.Actor Elijah Wood confirmed Feldman s claims in May 2016, describing Hollywood as a den of  vipers  in an interview, and saying  If you can imagine it, it s probably happened. Wood said he was protected from abuse by his mother, who didn t let him go to Hollywood parties, but he said other young child actors were regularly  preyed upon  by those in power.Wood also compared Hollywood s sexual predators with known pedophile and English TV personality Jimmy Savile. You all grew up with Savile,  Wood said.  Jesus, it must have been devastating. Clearly something major was going on in Hollywood. It was all organized. X-Men director Bryan Singer is among those publicly accused of sexual abuse of young boys in Hollywood.Was Weinstein one of the men Elijah Wood says is sexually  preying upon  young children in Hollywood?

President Trump Offers Congress Hard-Line Deal On Immigration&Shines Spotlight On Democrats Agenda To Put Votes Before American Citizens","AP  President Donald Trump has told congressional leaders that his hard-line immigration priorities must be enacted in exchange for extending protection from deportation to hundreds of thousands of young immigrants, many of whom were brought to the U.S. illegally as children.Trump s list of demands included overhauling the country s green-card system, a crackdown on unaccompanied minors entering the country, and building his promised wall along the southern border.Many were policies Democrats have said explicitly are off the table and threaten to derail ongoing negotiations over legislation protecting young immigrants known as  Dreamers.  They had been given a reprieve from deportation and the ability to work legally in the country under President Barack Obama s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program, which Trump ended last month.In a letter to House and Senate leaders released by the White House Sunday, Trump said the priorities were the product of a  a bottom-up review of all immigration policies  that he had ordered  to determine what legislative reforms are essential for America s economic and national security. These findings outline reforms that must be included as part of any legislation addressing the status of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients,  he wrote, adding that:  Without these reforms, illegal immigration and chain migration, which severely and unfairly burden American workers and taxpayers, will continue without end. Trump announced last month that he was ending the DACA program, but he gave Congress six months to come up with a legislative fix before recipients began to lose their status. Trump suggested at the time that he was eager for a deal, telling reporters,  I have a love for these people and hopefully now Congress will be able to help them and do it properly. He d also tweeted that if Congress was unwilling to find a fix, he would  revisit this issue!  in six months.

More ugly stories continued to dribble out over the weekend, including a vulgar report by a news anchor that Weinstein masturbated in front of her and other stories of inappropriate propositions.Internally Weinstein continued to fight for his survival, insiders have told TheWrap. His advisors   including his brother Bob   told him that he needed to take the allegations seriously and not merely pay lip service. They wanted him to leave for six months and get treatment for sex addiction or whatever his behavior may be called.Weinstein told TheWrap in an interview on Thursday that he was sincere in his apology and intention to make amends. But reports continued to leak out of the company internally that the CEO was determined to dictate the terms of his leave of absence and treatment.Harvey and Bob Weinstein co-founded the indie film company Miramax in 1979 and grew it into a powerhouse brand that made art-house films mainstream   and reshaped the Academy Awards race with aggressive marketing and buzz.The company was bought by Disney in 1993, where the brothers continued to run the company   and dominate the Oscar race   until they left in 2005 to launch the new privately held The Weinstein Company.

Whilst discussing the inauguration of President Trump, asked if she wanted to scream, Clinton told RT ,  Oh, I did. But that was a common occurrence in those days. You know, scream into the pillow when I saw what was happening. I would have been disappointed and really unhappy if I had lost to a normal Republican. But to lose to someone who I believed profoundly was not ready for the job, was temperamentally unqualified for the job   was such a burden. I just thought,  I ve let everybody down, I ve let my country down, I ve let the world down. How did this happen?

I knew there were these other forces at work that needed to be unpacked and analyzed. It s not only about what happened, it s about preventing it from happening again,  she added.

What that tells us is this man was NEVER a true Republican! He s a RINO! DRAIN THE SWAMP!PROOF BELOW THAT WHAT TRUMP SAID IS TRUE:CORKER THREATENS TO HALT PROGRESS ON TAX REFORM Corker announced in September that he will retire after his term expires in 2018. Sen. Corker announced his departure from the Senate one day after Breitbart News reported on his $3 million  swamp  deal and just hours after conservative Judge Roy Moore beat establishment candidate Sen. Luther Strange (R-AL) in a Senate runoff election.Now, Sen. Corker threatens to halt any progress that Republicans have made with tax reform, similarly to how Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) tanked Obamacare repeal twice this year. Patty McMurray Corker said at the hearing,  This is some of the most meaningless work that we do here.  The Tennesseean argued that the 2018 budget amounts to nothing more than a vehicle for Republicans to pass a tax reform package.Republicans hope to use budgetary reconciliation to attach a tax reform proposal to the 2018 budget that will allow the Senate to pass the tax reform legislation using a simple majority. GOP lawmakers tried to repeal and replace Obamacare using the same strategy.The current tax plan proposal introduced by Republicans would include $4 trillion in tax cuts. Republicans hope to cut roughly $2.5 trillion in missing revenue by closing loopholes and eliminating deductions to hit the maximum $1.5 trillion deficit allowed for Congress s budget rules.President Donald Trump said that the tax reform plan  will be rocket fuel for our economy.  Read more: BreitbartHere is the article that verifies what Trump said is true about the cabinet post:Sen. Bob Corker emerged from an interview Tuesday with Donald Trump and said he believed the president-elect had narrowed the list of candidates for secretary of state to  a very small group.  The selection process for who will run the State Department in the Trump administration has been grueling, including grumbling among Mr. Trump s allies about his considering bitter foe Mitt Romney for the nomination. Mr. Corker, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, described this moment as  the greatest opportunity in modern times to really strengthen our nation s security interests around the world and help us economically.  He said that he was honored to be considered for the job.  It s been an honor to have the kind of meeting that I had today. We had a very wide-ranging meeting, actually a couple meetings and his instincts on foreign policy are obviously very, very good,  Mr. Corker told reporters at Trump Tower, where Mr. Trump lives and the transition team offices are located.  I know he has a number of outstanding individuals that he s talking with. I was glad to be here and glad to see more fully some of what his views about the world are,  he said. Pressed about when he expected Mr. Trump to announce the nomination, Mr. Corker said they didn t talk about that in the meeting.  I think he ll make the decision when he s comfortable. My sense is he s narrowed it down to a very small group of people,  he said.

Public opinion about the NFL and its players has taken a huge hit since President Trump tweeted about his disgust for the lack of respect the players have shown for our flag. NFL ratings continue to be in the basement.Sporting News   The alarming fall in NFL TV ratings this season is partly because of fan anger over on-field protests by Colin Kaepernick and other players of the American flag/national anthem, according to pollster Rasmussen Reports.Nearly one-third (32 percent) of adults say they re less likely to watch NFL game telecasts because of the Kaepernick-led player protests against racial injustice, according to Rasmussen s telephone/online survey of 1,000 American adults conducted Oct. 2-3.Only 13 percent said they were more likely to watch an NFL game because of continuing protests by Kaepernick and supporters such as Antonio Cromartie of the Colts (who was cut only two days after raising a fist during the playing of  The Star-Spangled Banner  in London on Sunday).

"MAYORAL CANDIDATE In DIE-HARD DEMOCRAT City May Prove That 2016 Trump Win Was Just The Beginning of The End For Democrats","If John Persinger wins the mayoral race in Erie, Pa., next month, it just might be the greatest local political upset in America this century. A Republican candidate has not been elected mayor here since 1961, when JFK was president.Tall, witty, energetic and razor-sharp, Persinger is not the guy you d expect to settle in a town like Erie. He is the kind of person who leaves, moves on to blazing success elsewhere and never returns.Persinger s grandfather, John DeMarco, was the son of Italian immigrants who was supposed to take over the family grocery store but instead went to medical school and ended up delivering more than 12,000 Erie babies.Before he was born, Persinger s parents moved to the suburbs outside New York City, but young John spent his summers with his grandparents in this port city in northwestern Pennsylvania. He got his undergrad degree at Harvard, where he was captain of the swim team; he also competed in the 2000 US Olympic team trials.From there he served as an aide in the George W. Bush White House and then chief of staff at the US Embassy in Australia, where he met his wife, a journalist fluent in Arabic. He left government for Notre Dame Law School, but when the couple started to have children, they decided Erie held the most promise for their young family.In many ways, they are correct. The city is affordable, the housing is charming. It is both a college town (there are three: Mercyhurst, Gannon and Penn State Behrend) and a tourist town (miles and miles of beaches along the lake). It boasts some of the top medical facilities in the country, and it is also a company town (Erie Insurance is one of the top employers).But it is also a struggling city, where schools are hurting financially, the opioid epidemic is rampant and the manufacturing base is collapsing   all factors that led Erie County residents to vote for a Republican president in 2016, the first since Ronald Reagan.The city of Erie, however, is a different story   Hillary Clinton won all 69 of its voting districts over Donald Trump.So can 35-year-old Persinger convince his townspeople to turn red? It s not impossible. And while he is nothing like the president in terms of temperament and style, the two politicians do share a key quality   tapping into voters  willingness for change. The fourth-largest city in the state, Erie has a population just under 100,000 and a 5.6 percent unemployment rate.As Persinger walked the shop floor of Fralo Industries, a sheet-metal fabricating plant, he talked to each worker, asking what they were making. One young man said he was building a new invention for college dorms that puts laundry in a shoot and allows students to track its progress until it s ready for pickup in a pod. Another worker was steering a high-tech laser.Persinger gives each worker his full attention, nodding and taking notes. He seems unbothered by the fact he s a Republican in a city with a nearly 3-1 Democratic registration advantage. Here, people are born blue.It doesn t seem to ruffle him that his rival, Democrat Joe Schember, is one of the nicest guys in the world and has been active in the community for over 40 years. Plus, they re neighbors (they even live on the same street). Everyone asks me about my odds. I am confident if I run a good, honest campaign, I can win,  Persinger said.  I didn t take time away from my family and waste the time of voters . . . not to win. Persinger is forward-thinking and energetic; he drives around in a mobile campaign office (a 22-year-old converted RV) with his name and photo shrink-wrapped around the entire vehicle. He visits neighborhoods, churches, community centers, mosques, synagogues and knocks on doors where no Democratic or Republican mayoral candidate has been for decades, especially in the African-American and Hispanic communities.And he listens. It is a trait that has not gone unnoticed in the black communities who for years have had their votes taken for granted by the Democrats and ignored by the Republicans.Just ask Steve McLallen, who got a visit from Persinger earlier this year.  Hey, I just want to let you know I appreciate your willingness to come and listen to our concerns,  McLallen told Persinger as he shook hands with the GOP candidate.  You have made an impression and impact on me, not just by traveling to our neighborhoods or where we work, but actually asking us what we need. A longtime Democrat, McLallen said he is voting for Persinger.Jim Baer, meanwhile, is looking for new blood in the mayor s office. A welder at Fralo, he s a Democrat who did not vote for Clinton or Trump but is tired of the same old politics.  Look, we tried the old ways; we have had nothing but Democrats running this city and managing the decline. It is time to place someone young with different ideas and the willingness to listen in charge,  he said.While neither candidate has invested in polling, both keep detailed data on their campaigns  voter outreach and they know this race is close.

Democratic Party: Soros  funding activities are devoted largely to helping the Democratic Party solidify its power base. In a November 2003 interview, Soros stated that defeating President Bush in 2004  is the central focus of my life     a matter of life and death.

"#WINNING UPDATE: Arizonas Other Anti-Trump, RINO Senator Just Got Some Very Bad News","Watch President Trump hammer Senator McCain and the  weak  Senator Flake at an Arizona rally, where he also threw his support behind Dr. Kelli Ward:AP  Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake s re-election race is becoming a case study in the GOP s convulsions among the establishment, a furious base, and angry donors.After bucking Donald Trump in a state the president won, Flake is bottoming out in polls. Yet Republicans look like they may be stuck with a hard-core conservative challenger who some fear could win the primary but lose in the general election.A White House search for a candidate to replace former state Sen. Kelli Ward in the primary appears to have hit a wall. And now conservatives want to turn Arizona into the latest example of a Trump Train outsider taking down a member of the GOP establishment. People are fooling themselves if they think Jeff Flake is anything but a walking dead member of the United State Senate,  said Andy Surabian, whose Great America Alliance is backing Ward. I don t see how he survives a primary. I don t see how he survives a general. The numbers just don t add up,  added Surabian, who worked at the White House as an adviser to Steve Bannon, then the president s top strategist.Despite discontent among some Republicans over Ward, Bannon met with her last week at a conservative conference in Colorado Springs to encourage her campaign, according to a Republican official who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose the previously unreported private meeting.Ward unsuccessfully challenged Arizona s senior senator, John McCain, in last year s election, losing in the primary by a wide margin. But in Flake, she would face a more vulnerable candidate at a moment when the GOP establishment is on the defensive, facing a simmering anti-incumbent mood heightened by Republicans  failure to make good on seven years of promises to scrap Barack Obama s health care law.Flake is in danger of becoming the latest victim of this voter wrath. Yet rather than making an effort to soothe pro-Trump GOP voters, he s all but dared them to take him down by kicking off his campaign with an anti-Trump manifesto,  Conscience of a Conservative,  a book in which he bemoaned his party s failure to stand up to Trump in last year s presidential race. We pretended that the emperor wasn t naked,  Flake wrote.Trump, in turn, has lashed out at Flake on Twitter, calling him  toxic,  while praising Ward. White House officials say there s little chance Trump will have a change of heart over supporting Flake. One official, speaking on condition of anonymity to disclose private deliberations, said Trump is irritated not only by Flake s public criticism but by what Trump sees as the senator s attempts to use his critiques of the president to gain attention.Nevertheless, Flake, 54, insists he won t be getting out of the race. The primary is Aug. 29. ",politics,"Oct 7, 2017"

"LOL! BLACK STUDENTS UNITED Demands Racist Cornell University Stops Recruiting Blacks That Arent Like Them","EAG    Black Students United    which represents people of the  African diaspora    penned a letter to university administration recently in response to allegations that a white student from the Psi Upsilon fraternity severely beat a black student from the Kappa Sigma fraternity in mid-August.Cornell closed down the Psi Upsilon fraternity as it works to  develop and implement steps to be a more equitable, inclusive and welcoming university,  according to The Washington Post.John Greenwood, the 19-year-old student accused of the beating, faces a third-degree assault charge and possible hate crimes. Greenwood apologized for using  abhorrent language  during the dispute, but his attorney has maintained that Greenwood was  in no way involved in any physical altercation of any kind,  according to The Cornell Daily Sun.Black Students United want more to be done, and they re using the unfortunate incident to pressure school officials into a list of 12 demands   at least some of which target other black students.The demands are prefaced with a diatribe on Cornell s inherently white supremacist system that allegedly perpetuates a daily assault of racism against black students on campus. We attend a university that s obsessed with the optics of our black and brown faces but is indifferent to the justice we week. This is not an indictment of white people; this is an indictment of a system that perpetuates white supremacy and shelters our peers under the warm blanket of white privilege   all the while, we are left to freeze in our frigid reality of racist epithets, essentialist curriculum, and apathetic governance,  the letter read. In post-racial America, our classmates call us niggers from their pickup trucks in broad daylight. In post-racial America, we are berated by airborne bottles on our own campus. In post-racial America, we are told we have a chip on our shoulder. We are called everything but our name. Above all else, in post-racial America we are bombarded by the deafening silence that allows the centuries-old hum of white supremacy to grow louder,  it continued.  Silence is violence. Because Cornell is racist, and its Interfraternity Council is an alleged arm of the white supremacist system, Black Students United drew up a list of 12 demands that will help set things right.They include a system of mandatory coursework for all students that s focused on race, gender, discrimination, white privilege and other social justice causes from the perspective of  oppressed people,  as well as mandatory training for staff on the same issues.Black Students United want Psi Upsilon shut down and to use the building as  an adequate and appropriate space for the people of the Africa diaspora to utilize for programs of any kind, in perpetuity. The group also demands mandatory diversity and inclusion training for all greek members on campus, a special  minority liaison  position on the University Assembly, Cornell Health to hire at least two black psychologists and one black doctor in coming years, a new student-led dispute resolution process, and a limit on different types of black students admitted to the Ivy League school. We demand that Cornell Admissions to come up with a plan to actively increase the presence of underrepresented Black students on this campus. We define underrepresented Black students as Black Americans who have several generations (more than two) in this country,  the letter read.The problem is there are too many black students from other places outside of the U.S., Black Students United argued. The Black student population at Cornell disproportionately represents international or first-generation African or Caribbean students,  BSU wrote.  While these students have a right to flourish at Cornell, there is a lack of investment in Black students whose families were affected directly by the African Holocaust in America. Cornell must work to actively support students whose families have been impacted for generations by white supremacy and American fascism. The demands also include a call for an  Anti-Racism Institute  to  educate the campus and community about the horrors of white supremacy and political education,  among other things.",politics,"Oct 6, 2017"

After turning her back and pausing, Cruz does swear to defend the Constitution, and then enthusiastically repeats to uphold the Puerto Rican Constitution.Her approval rating was as low as 24% earlier this year.

"4 EASY TO UNDERSTAND REASONS My Ancestors Are NOT The Same as Illegals Who Come To America Today","How many times have liberals used the argument that  everyone s relatives came here illegally!  ? The answer is about a million or more times. Liberals can t seem to differentiate between people who came to our nation to either escape persecution or to find a better life that came through Ellis Island or immediately applied for citizenship in America, and those who float across the Rio Grande on an inner-tube after paying a coyote a fee to help them illegally cross our borders.This meme brilliantly explains the difference in 4 short bullet points.:Here s a little visual for anyone who tells you #4 isn t true:It is estimated that 12.5 million illegal aliens are currently living in the United States.Below, are a series of visuals from the Federation for American Immigration Reform or FAIR to help Americans to understand the cost of illegal immigration to taxpaying Americans. This data from September 27, 2017, paints a pretty bleak economic picture for America if we continue to ignore the serious problem of illegal immigration:   FAIR   At the federal, state, and local levels, taxpayers shell out approximately $134.9 billion to cover the costs incurred by the presence of more than 12.5 million illegal aliens, and about 4.2 million citizen children of illegal aliens. That amounts to a tax burden of approximately $8,075 per illegal alien family member and a total of $115,894,597,664. The total cost of illegal immigration to U.S. taxpayers is both staggering and crippling. In 2013, FAIR estimated the total cost to be approximately $113 billion. So, in under four years, the cost has risen nearly $3 billion. This is a disturbing and unsustainable trend. ",politics,"Oct 5, 2017"

Soon as I heard it was country music, I felt relief. White people shooting white people isn t terror   it s community outreach. #LasVegas,  the tweet read.Morelli attempted to apologize for his remark:Morelli, who described himself as politically  lost  with no allegiances, said his tweet about the deaths was thoughtless. It was a dumb joke and it didn t work. I own it. It was stupid,  Morelli said. It was seven in the morning and I was stressed out and freaked out by the shooting,  he added.  I was trying to participate, and all I did was put my foot in my mouth. But is he really sorry, or is he only doing damage control?  Only one month ago, Morelli posted this vile image on Max s Deli s Facebook page. Although Morelli admitted that after his post, his family, who were affected by his outrageous post, are  done  with him. Chicago Tribune   Highland Park deli is facing backlash over a Facebook post that includes a cartoon drawing of a man wearing a Nazi armband, giving a stiff-armed salute and donning a T-shirt reading,  I m with Alt-Right. Greg Morelli, who owns Max s Deli with his brother, posted the image last week. Morelli frequently posts the deli s menu along with cartoon drawings he creates to the restaurant s Facebook page. He said the recent events in Charlottesville inspired him to use the page to make a strong political statement. I have a Jewish deli, I am a Jewish man,  Morelli said.  I am the first person that s going to get a brick through the window if this plague is not stopped immediately. Morelli, 49, said the image was of an alt-right member who has hair evocative of President Donald Trump, but was not meant to be a depiction of the president himself.The full post and its related image are still on the deli s Facebook page.He said the deli was inundated with calls on Thursday as the post began to spread on Facebook and through news stories. Callers have been criticizing the post s imagery and its political message, he said.The effect of the post on his family has been difficult and Morelli says they are  done with him. When you create a storm, everyone that loves you just wants you to take the easy path,  he said.In a Facebook post on the restaurant s page Thursday evening, Morelli did not back down from the discussion the initial image provoked. I do not regret getting involved. I do not regret speaking out,  he wrote.  I do not regret assigning symbolism to hatred. I do not regret being trashed on Facebook. That said, it hurt. When asked about the specific use of Nazi imagery in the post and the reaction to not just his intended message, but the image itself, Morelli said the symbolism was a necessary point to make. We have to use the imagery and assign it to the groups so we know how to react,  Morelli said.  I happen to find satire very powerful. ",politics,"Oct 5, 2017"

When will Americans find something better to do with their time than watching a TV show or movie featuring an actor or actress who boldly stands against our First and Second Amendment Rights, and regularly spews hate against our President because he bravely defends those inalienable rights?If you want to see a man who faces a  firing squad  each and every day, while celebrities sit comfortably in their Malibu mansions, acting as keyboard warriors for the left, attacking him and anyone who supports him,  you don t have to look too far:Celebrity Sheryl Crow joined the hate fest against gun owners and called out politicians who support our Second Amendment Right by saying:  Any politician who takes money from the NRA has blood on their hands.

"NANCY PELOSI Thanks Dreamers for Coming to U.S. Illegally: Theyre so lovely [Video]","This is what Democrats think of people who broke our laws to come to America? Nancy Pelosi thanked a  Dreamer s  parents Wednesday for bringing him to the United States illegally. Pelosi made the remark during a town hall with CNN s Chris Cuomo where she took a question from  Dreamer  Adrian Reyna. Our Dreamers, they make America dream again,  Pelosi said.  They re so lovely and we, frankly, owe a debt to your parents for bringing you here to be such a brilliant part of our future. AND she s happy to let the tax payers foot the bill for these illegals:The swelling population of illegal immigrants and their kids is costing American taxpayers $135 billion a year, the highest ever, driven by free medical care, education and a huge law enforcement bill, according to the the most authoritative report on the issue yet.Dreamers are individuals who were brought illegally to the United States as children. Former president Barack Obama s administration provided cover to Dreamers from possible deportation to their countries of origin with the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) executive order in 2012.The Trump administration rescinded the order last month and called on Congress to replace it within six months. Reyna expressed concern about Democrats coming to a deal with President Donald Trump about illegal immigration and Dreamers.Pelosi promised Reyna that a clean  Dream Act  would be passed before December.Pelosi continued to heap praise on Dreamers and their families and laid out Democrats  plan to block the Trump administration and Republicans from taking any kind of potential action against illegal immigration.Read more: WFB ",politics,"Oct 5, 2017"
"WATCH: FORMER PUERTO RICO Governor HUMILIATES Pouting MSNBC Host Mika Brzezinski For Putting Her Hate For Trump Before Needs Of Hurricane Victims","A former governor of Puerto Rico shut down a question from MSNBC host Mika Brzezinski on Wednesday when she asked about President Donald Trump s treatment of San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul n Cruz.Trump and Cruz s interactions and criticisms have drawn national attention during the process of helping Puerto Rico recover from Hurricane Maria, with Cruz charging that the Trump administration has been too slow in delivering federal assistance. Trump tweeted criticism of her over the weekend, saying she exhibited  poor leadership  and that others in Puerto Rico were not doing enough to  get their workers to help. Upon meeting each other face-to-face on Tuesday, Cruz told Trump it was saving lives and  not about politics.  Trump shook her hand and then walked away.After  Morning Joe  played the clip, a cross-armed Brzezinski looked disgusted. After welcoming former Puerto Rico Gov. Luis Fortu o to the show, she asked him what he made of Trump s treatment of Cruz. I m very sorry, Mika, but I m not going to get into local politics,  Fortu o said.Brzezinski did a double take upon hearing his answer. If she s running for governor, there are different parties I don t care,  Fortu o said.  I care about results. Is that what you think it is?  Brzezinski asked.  You think it was politics that had him attacking her? I have no idea,  he said.  All I can tell you is we need results. We have people that desperately need help.

San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz, who has refused to participate in any FEMA meetings regarding aid to Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, has continually accused the Trump administration of not helping out in Puerto Rico s time of need, going so far as to claim the federal government is  killing  Puerto Ricans.Fox News  Geraldo Rivera went down to Puerto Rico and actually confronted Cruz about her statement that people are  dying  because of the Trump administration s  inefficiency and bureaucracy. But are people dying? I ve been traveling around, I don t see people dying,  Rivera challenging Cruz said.  I spoke to the doctors, they say they saw 53 patients and they had a person who was septic, but nobody dying. Dying is a continuum,  Cruz said in response.  If you don t get fed for seven, eight days and you re a child, you are dying. If you have 11 people like we took out of a nursing home, severely dehydrated, you are dying. Of course dying is a continuum. Everyone eventually dies. It s an unfortunate part of life. But, when it comes to Puerto Ricans dying from neglect and a lack of supplies, Rivera wasn t buying it. The death count was 16 a week ago. It remains 16 today,  Rivera said.  People are not dying. Here s the video of Rivera s interview with Cruz:Backing up Rivera s claims, an article released on Sunday by the Daily Mail said that a Puerto Rican woman claiming to be a police officer alleged that Cruz and Puerto Rican Governor Ricardo Rossello have been holding back supplies  in order to make for better photo opportunities.

"PRESIDENT TRUMP WEIGHS Executive Order On WELFARE REFORM: If Youre an Able Bodied American Who Wants A Paycheck&Find A Job","Trump administration officials are mulling an executive order that would instruct federal agencies to review low-income assistance programs, part of a coming effort to make sweeping changes to the country s welfare system.The White House began circulating a draft order to federal agencies for comment last week, according to two administration officials, who were granted anonymity to discuss the internal deliberations.One of the officials said the draft order calls on agencies to review existing regulations and propose new rules that conform to a set of broad welfare principles, including tighter work requirements that encourage recipients to shift back into the labor force.The order also calls for streamlining or eliminating duplicative services and establishing metrics for holding agencies accountable for program performance. It also encourages greater cooperation with state and local governments.  PoliticoIf Americans are serious about helping to raise up the lower and middle class in America, it must start with jobs. President Trump has made a serious commitment to keeping American companies and manufacturing in America. If the US government continues to pay people to stay home, those jobs won t be worth fighting to keep here.A study by the NBES shows a correlation between parents who are welfare dependent and their children who are more likely to also become government dependents: If parents become welfare dependents, the likelihood of their children eventually becoming welfare recipients also increases. Specifically, when parents are awarded DI, the likelihood that one of their adult children will participate in DI rises by 5 percentage points over the next five years, and 11 percentage points over the next decade. These findings suggest that a more stringent screening policy for DI benefits would not only reduce payouts to current applicants, but would also have long-run effects on participation rates and program costs. The results underscore how important accounting for intergenerational effects can be when making projections of how participation rates and program costs may be affected by program reforms.One of our favorite videos was made in the city of Detroit that shamelessly glorifies the benefits of an EBT card, a government assistance program that was initially created to provide food for low-income families. Like most other government handout programs, the card is now used like a credit card for gas and other products unrelated to food. President Trump is likely going to spur anger and hate like we haven t seen before if he pulls the plug on welfare assistance for Americans who have been trapped in a government dependancy program in exchange for votes by Democrats for generations.When generation after generation of Americans stop having the desire to earn a living, this is the result: ",politics,"Oct 3, 2017"

"CNN REPORTER: Victims at Las Vegas Concert Were Likely Trump Supporters [VIDEO]","CNN reporter Jeff Zeleny said on Monday that country music fans who attended the Las Vegas concert  Sunday night were  likely Trump supporters . Zeleny does what the left has been saying not to do he politicizes this horrific massacre by using identity politics. What would the left do without identity politics? It s their go-to strategy in all situations but is particularly sickening in this tragic one.NOTE: THERE IS SOME MIC TROUBLE DURING THE VIDEO At least 50 people were killed and more than 500 were injured when gunman Stephen Paddock opened fire on country music festival attendees Sunday night from his 32nd floor room at Mandalay Bay Hotel, according to local authorities.Zeleny said Trump, in his remarks about the shooting, took on the role of being a unifier for the country. The president, he left it to his role of being a unifier. He did not talk about the investigation, he did not talk about the suspect,  Zeleny said.Trump called on  the bonds that unite us  during remarks Monday morning. In moments of tragedy and horror, America comes together as one, and it always has,  he said.  We call upon the bonds that unite us, our faith, our family, and our shared values. We call upon the bonds of citizenship, the ties of community, and the comfort of our common humanity. Zeleny further commented on the personal connections that Trump has to the city of Las Vegas. By saying that he will go to Las Vegas on Wednesday, by visiting this, it is something that puts him in line with what so many presidents before him have done and paid their respects. Of course Las Vegas is a town that he is connected to, and knows well,  Zeleny said.  His name is emblazoned on the top of a hotel there as well. He campaigned there a lot. Zeleny said, however, that the conversation after the tragedy will soon be focused on politics. The moment here, is what comes after this. This invariably, after today and tomorrow, will become a discussion of politics, of guns. It s not appropriate for that moment today,  he said.In the video, it appears CNN had audio problems, which caused the host to interrupt Zeleny several times. ",politics,"Oct 2, 2017"

The famed black media proprietor and TV host was thrown into the political mix on Thursday when an op-ed in the New York Post suggested she is  uniquely positioned, should she wish to commit herself, to seek the Democratic nomination for president and challenge Trump in 2020. John Podhoretz, a never-Trump advocate and former speechwriter for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, shared his essay on Twitter   and Oprah answered.

"Jared Kushner NEVER Registered To Vote As A Female&Media Lie BACKFIRES&Shines Bright Light On How Easily Voter Fraud Can Occur","Meanwhile, as President Trump continues to meet resistance from blue states in his effort to clean up voter fraud, one of his most vocal opponents is none other than the Democrat governor of New York, the same state where the board of elections made the mistake of changing Kushner s identity to a  female  AFTER he registered as a  male . It seems like this may be just the high-profile screw-up the White House has been waiting for in order to revisit the legitimacy of voter rolls in New York.NY refuses to perpetuate the myth voter fraud played a role in our election. We will not comply with this request.https://t.co/eQC6ORV0v1  Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) June 30, 2017Kushner, President Trump s son-in-law, and senior adviser did in fact list himself as a male in his New York voter registration   but an elections database error led to him getting listed as a female.Kushner s supposed registration as a woman, which made headlines Wednesday, is actually a data entry error that the New York Board of Elections corrected only after it became public.A Wired story first reported that Kushner   whose father-in-law has been waging a fact-challenged war on voter fraud   was registered as a woman on his publicly accessible New York State voter information.   NYDaily NewsThe Wired story that was written by Ashley Feinberg suggests one of the reasons Kushner registered to vote as a female may be attributed to him committing voter fraud, which according to Feinberg,  would, of course, would be interesting, considering that Trump s White House has been fixated on allegations that rampant voter fraud took place during the 2016 election. The Huffington Post used the fake news story to prove that Jared Kushner is not capable of brokering peace in the Middle East. Here is their headline for an article written by Amanda Terkel:From the Huffington Post article:If people weren t already skeptical that Kushner   a man who inherited his father s real estate empire and has no policy experience in the Middle East or elsewhere   could achieve the impossible, recent developments may give further pause.He registered to vote as a woman.Radical leftist and (sometimes) comedian Jimmy Kimmel did an entire skit on Jared Kushner registering to vote as a  female.  We ll wait for his apology #VeryFakeNewsCNN quickly jumped on the story without verifying why Jared Kushner was registered as a female. Given the incompetence of our government agencies, one would think CNN would give Kushner the benefit of the doubt, but alas, giving anyone close to President Donald J. Trump the benefit of the doubt would be counter-productive to the Trump-hating network who only has one goal, and that is to destroy Donald Trump and anyone who dares to stand with him. CNN has changed the story that was originally attached to this tweet to reflect their update, but their headline that attempts to paint Kushner as either a liar or a cheat stands on Twitter.Jared Kushner is registered to vote as a female https://t.co/MtWq9uHTC7 pic.twitter.com/1ub2dS6OFM  CNN (@CNN) September 27, 2017Another loudmouth liberal who goes by the name of  Ring of Fire  on Youtube and has over 130K followers, has completely embarrassed himself by using Kushner s inability to  fill out a simple form  or  who is so careless, or reckless, or downright stupid that he cannot fill out a form .",politics,"Sep 29, 2017"

Last night was no exception!The stadium was filled with fans who chanted USA, USA! The fans were ready to see hand over heart during the national anthem but got something very disappointing instead. The players from both teams tried to split the difference and stand for the anthem while locking arms. Outraged fans considered it just as much a protest as taking a knee, the gesture made famous by former San Francisco 49ers player Colin Kaepernick who kicked off the protest last year. I am so ashamed of and appalled by the ignorance of any NFL player who would dare disgrace our Stars and Stripes or the memory of hundreds of thousands of fallen U.S. heroes who paid with their lives so that we may live free,  Packers shareholder and 20-year U.S. Air Force veteran Steven Tiefenthaler told the Green Bay Press-Gazette.Packers fans are in a unique position to have their voices heard because unlike the privately owned 31 other NFL teams, theirs is divvied up among over 360,000 fans who own over 5 million shares of the franchise.

"LOL! ONE HILARIOUS CARTOON Perfectly Illustrates How Embarrassingly Politically Correct The NFL Has Become","Watching sports on TV or going to a football stadium to watch a game, used to be a great way to unwind and forget about your troubles at home or at work. Watching sports used to be a stress reliever for many. That was before the NFL and the NBA was hijacked by the politically correct police, and social justice warriors, and morphed into something most fans don t  even recognize anymore.One of the worst cases of political correctness was when liberals insisted that the Washington Redskins change their name so as not to offend Native Americans. The left got very little support from Redskins fans and surprisingly, many in the Native American community were unwilling to join the fight to demand a name change for the team. Eventually, the left was forced to walk away from that fight, and accept that the owners of the Redskins were focused on playing football, and were not interested in their foolish game of political correctness.Today, the NFL is facing a huge backlash from fans, as players are being asked to choose activism over their allegiance to their fans who couldn t care less about their political views, they re coming to escape the stresses of everyday life and to watch these professional athletes play football. They don t come to see professional athletes kneeling on the sidelines during our national anthem in support of the Black Lives Matter anti-cop group, who inspired the killings of several innocent cops, shut down major roads, threatened innocent people who got in their way, and looted and burned cities to the ground. Fans come to relax and to forget about their troubles. They come to get away from the divisive politics and challenges of everyday life. They certainly don t travel to stadiums to attend games or watch them on TV so they can be admonished or scolded for not holding the same politically correct views as the snowflakes on the field.This hilarious cartoon by BenGarrison is a perfect example of who fans are paying to see on the field today:It won t be long before fans stop supporting these snowflakes, and politically correct crybabies, and maybe then, they ll remember why we came ",politics,"Sep 28, 2017"

Korea Torturing Otto Warmbier Who Died After Returning In A Coma","Yesterday, the parents of the now deceased American student from a Cincinnati, OH, suburb, Otto Warmbier, spoke out for the first time about the brutal condition of their son s body, who was returned from North Korea to the US in a coma. Otto was on a group tour of North Korea when he was accused of trying to steal a propaganda poster. He was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. After negotiations with the US State Department, Warmbier was returned from North Korea and died less than one week later.Fred and Cindy Warmbier told  Fox and Friends  about the harrowing moment they saw their 22-year-old son Otto on the plane after his return from 17 months in captivity.  When we got halfway up the steps, we heard this howling,  Fred Warmbier said.  We looked in and Otto was on the stretcher across in the plane and he was jerking violently, making these inhuman sounds. Otto s father Fred Warmbier painted a horrific picture of the condition in which they found their son upon his return to the U.S.:  Otto had a shaved head. He had a feeding tube coming out of his mouth. He was blind, he was deaf. As we looked at him and tried to comfort him, it looked like someone had taken a pair of pliers and rearranged his bottom teeth. Today, the leftist Time magazine joined other liberal publications who appear to be working to soften the image of the evil of Kim Jong Un by suggesting the horrific torture committed against American Otto Warmbier may never have happened.

"ANGRY GREEN BAY PACKERS Fans and Owners Lash Out After QB Aaron Rogers Asks Fans To Join Players In Protest Against Cops","Have Americans already forgotten about the real reason Kaepernick was kneeling during the national anthem? He was kneeling in support of Black Lives Matter and their war against law enforcement. NFL players who kneel or stand in solidarity with Colin Kaepernick are protesting against our law enforcement. Should anyone be surprised by the backlash these players are receiving from their fans, as they disrespect our flag to show their support for Black Lives Matter s war on cops?Breitbart   Sports teams ask a lot of their fans, especially in places like Green Bay. Where, depending on the time of year, a fan could get hypothermia while just sitting in his seat. However, one recent request the team has made of the Pack faithful has left fans feeling a little hot.The Packers players, led by their quarterback Aaron Rodgers, issued a call to their fans to join them in interlocking arms during the national anthem. However, some fans have not taken kindly to the request. According to the Green Bay Press-Gazette, Packers Director of Public Affairs, Aaron Popkey, says fan reaction has been intense. We ve had a steady stream of feedback beginning Monday morning and it continued into Wednesday. We ve heard on both sides of the matter. We take note of their concerns. The fact that Popkey alludes to the  concerns  of the fans, would certainly lead one to believe that the  steady stream  of fan feedback has definitely tacked more negative, than positive.The issue of anthem protests, already a hot-button issue, became an even bigger story after President Trump s comments in Alabama last Friday night. Where, he referred to players who protested the anthem as  SOB s,  and said he wished their team owners would fire them.Those comments, led to a backlash from the league last weekend. All told, more than 200 players from all 32 teams protested the president s comments in some form or fashion. The Packers stood with interlocking arms, in their game against the Bengals. With the exception of three players who remained on the bench.However, those demonstrations did not meet with universal fan approval. Steven Tiefenthaler, a Wisconsin native, Packers shareholder and 20-year U.S. Air Force veteran, told the Green Bay Press-Gazette exactly how the protests made him feel:  I am so ashamed of and appalled by the ignorance of any NFL player who would dare disgrace our Stars and Stripes or the memory of hundreds of thousands of fallen U.S. heroes who paid with their lives so that we may live free. Laura Hapke, another Wisconsin native whose mother is a shareholder of the team, was shocked that the Packers would participate in the protests. Hapke herself is on the waiting list to become a shareholder, though, the team s protests have given her some pause. Hapke said,  If they come out and say they are more into politics than patriotism, I ll have to rethink it. It will break my heart, but I ll have to rethink it. Hapke also had some really good advice for more constructive ways in which the players could protest, while letting the fans just enjoy the game. Hapke said,  If the players association would act outside of the game, I think it would be great. From the Green Bay Press Gazette: I am so ashamed of and appalled by the ignorance of any NFL player who would dare disgrace our Stars and Stripes or the memory of hundreds of thousands of fallen U.S. heroes who paid with their lives so that we may live free,  said Steven Tiefenthaler, a native of Brookfield who now lives in San Antonio. Tiefenthaler is a Packers shareholder and 20-year U.S. Air Force veteran.Shawano native Lloyd Hohn, who now lives in Bismark, N.D., said he is more disappointed than angry. It was and is a heartbreaker to see my beloved Packers involved in this protest. I doubt injustice is going to be affected by this action. It is style over substance,  he said.  The players during their off time need to be physically and vocally involved to bring change. From Mark Panteo:The arrogant Leftists of the Green Bay Packers want fans to join them in protesting the National Anthem in a supposed show of  unity. Apparently, the only way to show  unity  in the NFL is to protest the National Anthem.Disgusting. This detestable league deserves to go the way of the Hillary campaign. ",politics,"Sep 28, 2017"

How about we talk about not letting him wear this sh*t on campus?  the thief retorts, while Vitale later tells a growing presence of administrators that  the fact that you people haven t gotten this back for me is sad and wrong.

What a vile low candy-ass choice you made. I was looking for 100 percent participation, we were gonna be respectful of our football team,  Tomlin told reporters.Your team does not come before America.Why should anyone be forced to act in a way that is against their moral code? The poor boys  millionaire club could not all agree on whether or not to disrespect America so you hid. We Americans understand. Trust me.Let the kneelers kneel, the sitters sit, the Patriots stand, own your beliefs. Own your side. Everyone with a working knowledge of contract law knows that the players disrespecting America could have been fined in accordance with their contract.Remember Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf? He was fined $30,000 after disrespecting the flag and choosing to sit on his butt during the anthem. Once he was fined he worked out a compromise and stood, he recited Islamic prayers under his breath but he did not disgrace his team by disrespecting the American flag, the anthem, America herself.The administrative branch of the NFL is tax exempt.

Honoring 9/11 is detrimental, wearing pink in your hair to honor breast cancer survivors and casualties is detrimental, twerking is detrimental but dishonoring the American flag is not detrimental to the integrity of the NFL. Hypocrites. You lousy lowlife mamby-pamby, money-grubbing, cowardly, politically correct, assholes can all go to hell.Your decision to hide in the tunnel is disgusting and cowardly. Your decision to criticize Alejandro Villanueva a war veteran, a man who fought for your freedom, a man who saved lives, a man who was willing to lay his life down for you, a bronze heart recipient is beyond words.Mike Tomlin, James Harrison, Ben Roethlisberger and any Steeler who has the audacity to criticize or question Alejandro Villanueva standing for the National Anthem, choosing country over his team, you are what is wrong with America.

Scalise is in surgery right now and is expected to recover.Rand Paul said Scalise being there likely saved everyone because his presence (he s leadership) meant Capitol Police were there.Scalise, a member of the House Republican leadership as the majority whip, appeared to have been shot in the hip and it appeared two Capitol Hill police agents were shot, according to Rep. Mo Brooks who was on deck when the shooting occurred. The shooting took place at a practice for the GOP congressional baseball team.NBC News Special Report: Congressman Scalise, aides shot at baseball practice in Virginia https://t.co/KD9i1iP9MZ  Jason Calabretta (@JasonCalabretta) June 14, 2017In a statement, Texas Rep. Roger Williams, one of the team s coaches, said one of his staff members was shot during the incident and is receiving medical attention. There was no information on the staffer s injuries.According to both congressional and law enforcement sources, the shooting appears to be a  deliberate attack. Two law enforcement sources say the suspect  is in police custody, has been taken to a hospital.Lawmakers who spoke at the scene to reporters described a normal morning practice, at a field where they ve practiced for years, when all of a sudden shots rang out. Lawmakers, staff members and even the young son of one of the members ran for cover, jumping into dugouts and over fences to avoid the gunshots.Congressmen in attendance described  an injured Scalise dragging himself roughly 15 yards away from second base and lying there until the shooter was shot. The Congressmen then ran to help him. Once they were able, Sen. Jeff Flake said he and Rep. Brad Wenstrup, who is a physician, went out to where Scalise was lying to apply pressure to the wound. Nobody would have survived without the Capitol Hill police. It would have been a massacre without them.  -Rand Paul  We had nothing but baseball bats to fight back against a rifle with.

Jeff Flake added that he saw a member of Scalise s security detail return fire on the gunman for what felt like 10 minutes, even though the police officer was wounded in the leg.  50 shots would be an understatement, I m quite sure,  Flake said when asked about the total amount of gunfire, including police returning fire. Flake said two members of Scalise s security detail were wounded, and another man was wounded in the chest. Brooks said the shooter appeared to be a white male but added that  I saw him for a second or two.  He said the shooter was behind the third base dugout and didn t say anything.  The gun was a semiautomatic,  Brooks said, adding that he was sure it was a rifle but unsure what kind.  It continued to fire at different people.

"LOL! SNARKY WHITE YAHOO Sports Writer TRASHES Black NHL Player P.K.Subban For Saying Hell Never Kneel During National Anthem Because He Has Too Much Respect For American Flag","How very bold of the white Yahoo sports writer Greg Wyshynski, who affectionately refers to himself as  Puck Daddy  to call out one of only a handful of black men in the NHL for not standing up for the Black Lives Matter, anti-cop movement, that disrespects our flag, and our veterans in one fell swoop Wyshynski writes: P.K. Subban said on Tuesday that he will  never  kneel during the national anthem to protest something politically.Subban performed at a fundraiser on Tuesday night at Zanies Comedy Club in Nashville, to benefit Comedy Cares. He told the audience that he would  never  take a knee during the national anthem because he has too much respect for the American flag. His comments were sent to us by two eyewitnesses and confirmed by the Predators. Subban, who is Canadian, is considered the most prominent black player in pro hockey.Earlier in the day, the Nashville Predators announced that, as a team, they would not engage in any protests during the national anthem. This came less than two days after hundreds of NFL players, coaches and executives showed solidarity in rebuking President Donald Trump s comments that players who protested police brutality against African-Americans during the national anthem were  sons of bitches  who deserved to lose their jobs.Said CEO Sean Henry, to the Tennessean: When this all came about, we wanted to get together with our team because everything we do is collaborative. When we say what we re going to be doing, it really is a  we.  Everyone had input on it. We are honoring the anthem and the flag and the country by standing during the anthem. We invite our fans to do so with us.  It is also our way of honoring what else it stands for, and it does provide for the freedom for others to express their views and protests in a manner in which they feel comfortable doing. We just think there s proper forums for all. Our games have become this unifying celebration, so we have decided that we re all going to stand together to honor the country and all that comes with it. According to Seth Dean, a Predators fans who attended the comedy fundraiser event, Subban took the stage and said  he will continue to stand, respect, and sing along with U.S. anthem.  At one point, he pointed out a friend of his in the crowd who was a law enforcement officer from Boston.From Dean: He also addressed why he always shuffles his feet during anthem. He first said it could be ADD but he was never tested. Then he mentioned just being pumped up by crowd and excited to support USA even as a Canadian. He even jokingly suggested we should all stand and sing anthem there at Zanies (which didn t happen). He obviously wasn t going to go against Lavy s proclamation that players were going to stay standing, especially with his coach in the room, but he made his support for anthem as unequivocal as he possibly could. In an email to Yahoo Sports, Hailey, another attendee, described the scene in more detail:Tonight was a comedy fundraiser at Zanies in Nashville, for which Ryan Hamilton was the headliner. As my attendance was spontaneous, I was pretty excited when PK Subban was the first  comedian . Much to my surprise, his allegedly  impromptu  set ended with a tense promise from PK that despite his previous dancing antics during the national anthem, he would NEVER kneel during the national anthem, followed by a long rant about his  respect  for the American flag.

"Shocking Report: Mind Blowing Cost of Illegals Is Highest Ever&Numbers Released Show Huge Burden To States [Video]","EVERY American taxpayer should be outraged at the numbers in the report below. Open borders under 8 years of Obama is costing American taxpayers a tremendous amount more than ever before! Don t forget the thousands upon thousands of illegal alien minors who flooded the border during Obama s presidency. The bottom line is that open borders have consequences and the unfortunate consequence for taxpayers is we re footing the bill for illegals and THIS IS NOT SUSTAINABLE!The swelling population of illegal immigrants and their kids is costing American taxpayers $135 billion a year, the highest ever, driven by free medical care, education and a huge law enforcement bill, according to the the most authoritative report on the issue yet.DON T FORGET THAT OBAMA HELPED FACILITATE THE ARRIVAL OF THOUSANDS OF ILLEGAL MINORS THAT WE ARE NOW PAYING FOR: Spanish-language media and human rights activists are actively educating illegal immigrants on how to break the law, avoid immigration agents and remain in the country even after a judge has ordered them to be kicked out, a top Obama administration official testified to Congress on Tuesday.HERE S THOMAS HOMAN S TESTIMONY FROM 2014: Despite claims from pro-illegal immigration advocates that the aliens pay significant off-setting taxes back to federal, state and local treasuries, the Federation for American Immigration Reform report tallied just $19 billion, making the final hit to taxpayers about $116 billion. State and local governments are getting ravaged by the costs, at over $88 billion. The federal government, by comparison, is getting off easy at $45 billion in costs for illegals.n.The report, titled  The Fiscal Burden Of Illegal Immigration on U.S. Taxpayers,  is the most comprehensive cost tally from FAIR. It said that the costs have jumped about $3 billion in four years and will continue to surge unless illegal immigration is stopped. It was provided in advance exclusively to Secrets. Clearly, the cost of doing nothing to stop illegal immigration is far too high,  said FAIR Executive Director Dan Stein.  President Trump has laid out a comprehensive strategy to regain control of illegal immigration and bring down these costs,  said Stein.  Building the wall, enhancing interior enforcement and mandating national E-Verify will go a long way in bringing these ridiculously high costs under control,  he added.Over 68 often shocking pages, FAIR documents the average $8,075 in state, local and federal spending for each of the of 12.5 million illegal immigrants and their 4.2 million citizen children.Broadly, the costs include $29 billion in medical care, $23 billion for law enforcement, $9 billion in welfare, $46 billion for education.Just consider the cost of teaching an illegal alien child who doesn t speak English. FAIR estimates an average cost of over $12,000 a year, and that can reach $25,000 in New York. Add to that welfare, health care, school lunches, and the per student price soars.In state costs alone, California leads the list at $23 billion per year, followed by Texas at $11 billion, and New York at $7.4 billion.And it also documents the taxes paid and how they don t come close to offsetting the costs. What s more, FAIR noted that 35 percent of the illegal population operate in an underground economy hidden from tax collectors. And worse, employers hire illegals and either pay them cheaply or under the table. The United States recoups only about 14 percent of the amount expended annually on illegal aliens. If the same jobs held by illegal aliens were filled by legal workers, at the prevailing market wage, it may safely be presumed that federal, state and local governments would receive higher tax payments,  said FAIR.Key findings pulled from the report are shocking:The staggering total costs of illegal immigrants and their children outweigh the taxes paid to federal and state governments by a ratio of roughly 7 to 1, with costs at nearly $135 billion compared to tax revenues at nearly $19 billion.The nearly $135 billion paid out by federal and state and local taxpayers to cover the cost of the presence of 12.5 million illegal aliens and their 4.2 million citizen children amounts to approximately $8,075 per illegal alien and citizen child prior to taxes paid, or $6,940 per person after taxes are paid.On the federal level, medical ($17.14 billion) is by far the highest cost, with law enforcement coming second ($13.15 billion) and general government services ($8 billion) third.At the state and local level, education ($44.4 billion) was by far the largest expense, followed by general public services ($18.5 billion) and medical ($12.1 billion).The top three states based on total cost to state taxpayers for illegal immigrants and their children: California ($23 billion); Texas ($10.9 billion), and New York ($7.5 billion).Read more: WE ",politics,"Sep 27, 2017"

"MICHIGAN STATE POLICE CHIEF Under Fire For Sharing Meme On Social Media About NFL Players Anti-Cop Movement","Has the Left and the leftist media managed to make Americans forget why this whole  kneeling in protest against the American flag  in the NFL started? Have Americans forgotten the statement made by Colin Kaepernick when asked why he kneeled during our national anthem while every other player stood in respect for our flag?When the San Francisco 49 ers QB Colin Kaepernick was asked why he kneeled during our national anthem, his response was about police brutality, and about his belief that cops were essentially getting away with murdering blacks with no consequences.Here is Kaepernick s official statement:One day before 5 police officers were murdered in Dallas, TX by a Black Lives Matter supporter, Cleveland Browns player Isiah Crowell posted an image on his Instagram account of a man wearing an ISIS-like image of a man wearing an all-black outfit and black mask standing behind a police officer and stabbing him in the neck with a knife.The Cleveland Browns made the following statement on behalf of Crowell for his disgusting actions: We have spoken to Isaiah regarding his extremely disturbing and unacceptable social media decision. It was completely inappropriate and we have made him aware of our high level of disappointment. Isaiah has apologized but also knows that just an apology is insufficient and that he must take steps to make a positive difference after a very negative and impactful post. The NFL made no apology for Crowell s terrorist-like post aimed to incite violence against our law-enforcement officers. Should law enforcement officers be forced to remain silent in the face of a movement created to disparage and discredit the amazing work they do every day because of a Black Lives Matter, anti-cop movement that has permeated the NFL?Stephen Loomis, President of Cleveland Police Patrolmen s Association spoke out against Cleveland Brown s player Isiah Crowell. Lommis said he thinks the  store-bought apology  isn t enough.  He needs to go to Dallas, help the families who lost their loved ones last week, write them a check, look them in the eyes and give a heartfelt apology. Loomis says Crowell s post was as  offensive as putting a picture of historical African-American men being hung from a tree in the 60s.  He adds that if Crowell doesn t go to Dallas and make a donation,  I will pull Cleveland officers, sheriffs, state troopers out of First Energy Stadium this season if he doesn t make it right. As for Crowell admitting he was wrong and acted out of rage   Loomis says,  You re a grown ass man, and you claim you were too emotional to know it was wrong? Think we ll accept your apology? Kiss my ass.    TMZOn Sunday, the Patriots were booed wildly by fans when the team took a knee during our national anthem. Today, the leftist Detroit Free Press attempted to smear Michigan State Police Col. Kriste Kibbey Etue for sharing a message on social media criticizing the NFL players  protests.Here is the post that Etue did NOT create, but shared privately with her friends on Facebook. The message in this post is pretty clear. It s a message to the NFL letting them know that Americans will not sit back silently and allow millionaires who are obviously not grateful to be living in the United States disrespect our flag, our law enforcement officers, and our veterans.The Detroit Free Press used a statement from ONE SOURCE, Leonard Mungo, a Detroit attorney who, in 2015, filed a class action lawsuit against the Michigan State Police, who Mungo claimed were not hiring enough black and Hispanic troopers. The Detroit Free Press quote from Mungo said the posting demonstrates  kind of a dangerous mindset for someone in her powerful position. It s  scary that they don t understand that America is defined by its freedoms, and one of these freedoms is freedom of speech,  Mungo said. It also  has implications for why the state police   don t have representative numbers of African Americans in their ranks,  he said.Shanon Banner, a spokeswoman for Etue, said the colonel s Facebook post was not about race and was posted not publicly, but so that only Etue s friends would see it. As a public servant, Col. Etue has great respect for the armed forces and those who fight to protect our freedoms, Banner said in an e-mail to the Free Press.Etue did not create the post, Banner said.  It s a meme that is posted in other places around the Internet,  she said.Etue, who heads the statewide police department, shared the meme entitled  Dear NFL  on her Facebook page Sunday. It was a post widely shared on social media by those critical of hundreds of NFL players this past weekend who locked arms and/or kneeled during the pre-game playing of the national anthem. Some forms of the meme are calling for a boycott of the NFL until these silent gridiron protests end.The Michigan State Police issued an apology from Etue on their Facebook page. Americans should be asking why Etue has to apologize for standing up for law enforcement officers and veterans she defended in her post? While the left is screaming about the rights of the NFL players to disrespect our flag,  perhaps someone should ask them when Col. Etue s First Amendment Right become null and void? As a side note, The Detroit Free Press is home to Stephen Henderson, the race-obsessed, angry editorial editor who attempted to label Kid Rock (the single father of a black son and NAACP award winner) as a  racist , stirring up hate and negativity towards the beloved Detroit rocker who does so much for the residents of the city of Detroit.

O Reilly agreed that progressive groups like Media Matters track and threaten independent voices in the media who do not conform to progressive orthodoxy or talking points. These people want to wipe out any speech with which they disagree,  O Reilly said.Hannity said Media Matters, which was founded by left-wing political operative David Brock, threatened him and O Reilly over their planned interview.THEY EVEN HAVE A WEBSITE TO STOP HANNITY!

Advertisers have started dropping Hannity. Thanks in part to Media Matters  Stop Hannity advertiser education effort, advertisers are learning that financially supporting his political chicanery and Trump s political interests is bad for business. We ve seen this story unfold in the past, with O Reilly and Glenn Beck before him.Hannity s apparent decision to add O Reilly to his stable of guests is a disaster for Fox. The move gives ad buyers who were already concerned that Fox couldn t control Hannity a new reason for alarm. It gives advertisers who previously abandoned O Reilly s show a reason to fear that their ads elsewhere on the network could end up promoting him. And it gives British regulators   who were already reviewing Fox as part of Rupert Murdoch s $15 billion bid to purchase Sky   a reason to worry about the network s corporate governance and commitment to changing its seedy culture.Fox knows all this, so it seems more likely that the network was blindsided by a host who s out of its control than that it is willingly complicit in his effort to promote his former colleague. And Hannity knows it too. He just doesn t care.This may be the beginning of Fox s nightmare   the last remaining member of its former dream team, openly revolting and daring the network to fire him and let him take his audience somewhere else. It won t end until Hannity gets his way, or is sent on his way.MEDIA MATTERS WANTS TO DESTROY HANNITYThe two also discussed how such forces have tried to silence or  destroy  pro-Trump voices and  anyone who voted for him.

"BREAKING NEWS: Controversial ALABAMA GOP Senate Primary Race Winner Announced","Luther Strange will likely be the first and last establishment candidate Trump will make the admitted  mistake  of supporting Roy Moore defeated Alabama Sen. Luther Strange in Tuesday s Alabama Republican Senate primary runoff.The primary took on national importance as President Trump endorsed Strange, while traditional Trump allies, such as former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, backed Moore. They re going to say,  Donald Trump, the President of the United States, was unable to pull his candidate across the line. It is a terrible, terrible moment for Trump,  the president said while imitating news anchors at a Friday rally in Alabama in support of Strange.Strange become a senator when Jeff Sessions left his seat to become attorney general. The senator is a former lobbyist and was backed by a super PAC linked to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the Chamber of Commerce, a typical establishment GOP partner. Mitch McConnell and this permanent political class is the most corrupt and incompetent group of individuals in this country. They think you re a pack of morons. They think you re nothing but rubes,  Bannon said at a rally Monday in support of Moore.  They have no interest at all in what you have to say, what you have to think or what you want to do. However, Trump contended at his Friday rally in support of Strange that the senator barely knew McConnell, and that the Alabama senator is  determined to drain that swamp. The president would go on to say,  I ll be honest, I might have made a mistake,  and said he would campaign  like hell  for Moore if he were to win the primary. The former Alabama Supreme Court chief justice led the race throughout in the polls, and was up by 11 points in the final public poll.Moore is a major figure in Alabama and became nationally known in 2003 when he was removed from office after defying a federal court s ruling to remove a Ten Commandments monument from the Alabama state Supreme Court building.Like Trump, the former judge has a brash and sometimes offensive manner of speaking. Now we have blacks and whites fighting, reds and yellows fighting, Democrats and Republicans fighting, men and women fighting. What s going to unite us? What s going to bring us back together? A president? A Congress? No. It s going to be God,  Moore said in a campaign speech.  Daily Caller ",politics,"Sep 26, 2017"
"WATCH: SENATOR JOHN MCCAIN Tells TMZ Sports Reporter Hes Okay With NFL Players Disrespecting Our Flag","John McCain really doesn t care what topic reporters ask him about, he only cares how President Trump feels about it, so he can take an opposing view.  If President Trump agrees with a social or political issue, McCain disagrees with it. If Trump disagrees, McCain thinks it s a great idea.The cantankerous John McCain has become so predictable, it s almost laughable to hear his opinions anymore.  He s become an embarrassment to the Republican Party but refuses to give up the R behind his name to save the party of the humiliation of his antics.McCain s latest embarrassing interview happened today when TMZ caught up with him to ask him his thoughts on the NFL players taking a knee in a show of disrespect for our flag, as a way to support the anti-cop Black Lives Matter movement.  Instead of standing up our flag, or for his fellow veterans and the country he once fought so valiantly for, McCain took the cowardly way out and made a statement supporting the NFL player s right to disrespect our flag. Not surprisingly, McCain s remarks stood in contrast to strong admonition President Trump had for the disrespectful athletes in the NFL.Watch:",politics,"Sep 26, 2017"
"BOOM! DirecTV REFUNDS NFL Sunday Ticket Subscriptions After Being Bombarded With Angry Calls From Customers Over National Anthem Protests","Satellite service DirecTV is refunding NFL Sunday Ticket subscriptions for customers offended by the weekend s national anthem protests.Normally the company does not give refunds for the specialty package after the season starts, but it apparently changed course after getting calls from hoards of customers upset over the players and coaches who knelt for the anthem during Sunday and Monday games, one former subscriber said. I want to spend my money somewhere where it s gonna be appreciated,  former subscriber Paul Alvarado of Keller, Texas, told The Post.  I m paying for a product that should not include that kind of anti-American sentiment. Keller contacted DirecTV Tuesday to cancel his roughly $300-per-year plan when they surprised him by telling him he would get all the money back as a statement credit. The customer service rep he talked to said he had already received five calls to cancel on Tuesday alone, Alvarado said.DirecTV did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but Alvarado said the policy change happened overnight.

"WOW! TOP SPONSORS OF NFL Issue Statements About National Anthem Protests","Despite massive boycott threats by consumers, at least 3 major sponsors of the NFL have come out in support of players disrespecting our flag and our veterans. NFL players have joined the now unemployed 49 ers QB Colin Kaepernick to take a knee on the field during our national anthem as a way to show support for the Black Lives Matter anti-cop movement. The protest exploded over the weekend when President Trump spoke out against the disrespect NFL players are showing for our flag, turning the protest into an anti-Trump protest for players who many believe are still angry that Trump won the election, defeating the seriously flawed Democrat candidate, Hillary Clinton.Ford Motor Co., Armour Inc., and Anheuser-Busch InBev SA issued statements that affirmed NFL players  rights to kneel during the pre-game national anthem, while also sounding patriotic notes and affirming their support for the flag.Ford Motor Co, one of the biggest sponsors of the NFL just revealed that they are supporting the national anthem protests. We respect individuals  rights to express their views, even if they are not ones we share,  Ford stated.  That s part of what makes America great. Ford Motor Co chairman Martha Firestone Ford took her support for the players anti-cop, Black Lives Matter and anti-President Trump protests one step further when she joined her players on the field and linked arms with her daughters. The tangled responses are the latest version of the challenges faced by corporations in a world in which the president makes public demands and denouncements of companies via Twitter. General Motors Co., Campbell Soup Co., ESPN parent Walt Disney Co. and Uber Technologies Inc. have all faced calls for boycotts related to their perceived support of   or distance from   the White House.  BloombergAmericans are not as easily fooled by the actions of these disrespectful athletes and the team owners, as they work together with the media in an attempt to weaken and discredit our President for having the audacity to stand up for America, our flag and for the honor of every brave man and woman who have sacrificed their lives for our great nation.One of the great things about America is that consumers can decide not to purchase merchandise or goods from companies who continue to advertise with the NFL.

Watson points out that while they re protesting the deaths of blacks at the hands of cops in their communities, they completely ignore the rampant black on black crime and the actual high crime rates by blacks in the cities where the alleged  injustices  are taking place. Watson also claims the NFL players are ignoring the fact  that white people are more likely to be shot dead by cops  than blacks.This week, NFL players and even some coaches, turned their ire against President Donald Trump for daring to suggest that NFL owners should be taking disciplinary action against players who disrespect our flag that represents the lives sacrificed by so many brave men and women who died giving them the right to protest.Paul Joseph Watson reminds Americans how prevalent violence is with many of the  thugs  who play in the NFL. Watson even suggests,  Maybe they all hate the police so much because the cops are the only ones stopping them from beating up their own wives and girlfriends. This new incarnation of  take a knee  isn t about protesting police murders of black people.  There haven t even been any high-profilee cases of that for months.  It isn t about patriotism.

"WATCH: DESPERATE FOR RATINGS, Megyn Kelly Goes On Ellen Degeneres Show&Blames Trump For Her Exit From FOX News&Claims She Was Never A Political Person&Ellens Not Buying It","Ahead of the launch of her daily morning show, Megyn Kelly Today, the NBC News journalist stopped by The Ellen DeGeneres Show, where she explained how Donald Trump influenced her decision to leave Fox News after 12 years.  THRIt s pretty clear by Ellen s reactions to Kelly s answers that she s not a fan, and that as an employee of NBC, she s being forced to  take one for the team  with this very forced interview of the very unpopular Megyn Kelly prior to the debut of her new show.Watch, as Kelly attempts to convince Degeneres that after several years of making a fortune on FOX News where she became popular for what appeared to be her passionate political views, that she was  never a political person . LOL! :Kelly spent a good time of her interview with Degeneres deflecting from her unpopularity with the general public by blaming President Trump for her decision to accept $17 million from NBC to make the move to fluff journalism. Donald Trump has a way of clarifying one s life choices and that was true in my case, too,  Kelly said, explaining how she was struck by how her primetime news coverage  became all political.  When Kelly contemplated if Fox News was the right place for her,  the universe came and sort of shone a light and it was clear to me what I wanted to do. DeGeneres asked if any of Trump s infamous tweets targeted at Kelly were particularly what motivated her move, but Kelly said it was more than just the tweets:  The country s so divided right now and it s so political. It s like politics has become like race, you can t discuss it at all. Degeneres, who is known for being funny, only appeared to laugh twice during the entire segment. The first time was when Kelly wasn t honest with the audience when she claimed her ratings at FOX went up after she disrespected the President. (See chart below from Oct. 13, 2016, following her full-blown feud with then-candidate Donald Trump:)The second time was when she made Kelly look like a complete jackass by suiting her up in a sumo wrestler costume, to which Megyn responded in a very awkward and NOT funny way.

"Hero Church Member With CCL Stops Sudanese Shooter Who Stormed Church in Tennessee Kills and Injures Churchgoers","The main stream media is totally ignoring the horrific case of a Sudanese immigrant who stormed into a Tennessee church this morning and killed 1, injured several. Nashville Police have identified the suspect of a mass shooting at a church Sunday morning as 25-year-old Emanuel Kidega Samson.Samson is being charged with murder and multiple counts of attempted murder in the attack that killed one and left at least seven other people injured at the Burnette Chapel Church of Christ in Antioch, a town just south of Nashville, Tenn.IT COULD HAVE BEEN MUCH WORSE: One brave church member, 22-year-old Caleb Engle, confronted the Samson before being pistol whipped in the face. Engle then went to his car to retrieve a gun, which he has under a concealed carry license (CCL). Engle returned to the church to confront the gunman again. The gunman shot himself in the face when the man returned, possibly by accident. He s the hero here,  Nashville police chief Steve Anderson said.  He s the person who stopped this madness in its tracks. Later today, Engle released a statement: Samson is a bodybuilder who attended high school in Tennessee and is originally from Karthoum, Sudan, according screenshots of the suspect s Facebook page. Emanuel K. Samson came from Sudan in 1996. He was a legal US resident but not necessarily a US citizen.A Nashville Police Department spokesman said the shooter entered the church after 11 a.m. CST wearing a neoprene ski mask. One woman was shot in the parking lot before the shooter entered the church and opened fire on about 42 people still inside.That s when Caleb Engle became the hero that he is It could have been so much worse!SAMSON S BOOKING PHOTO:This is Emanuel Kidega Samson s booking photo. pic.twitter.com/z0Or6rJFAK  Metro Nashville PD (@MNPDNashville) September 25, 2017",politics,"Sep 24, 2017"
"LIFETIME VICTIMS of Injustice, MICHELLE and BARACK OBAMA Are Looking To Buy $15 Million Piece Of Land From Caroline Kennedy On Marthas Vineyard","Remember when Michelle Obama told an adoring crowd at the DNC Convention how she had to suffer through living in the White House that was  built by slaves ?Remember in 2015, when President Barack Obama used the  n  word during an interview where he talked about racism in America, and actually tried to convince the host that blacks are victims of racism today, as much as they were 200-300 years ago.Barack Obama invoked the most charged racial slur in American society during an interview published on Monday, as part of an argument that while the US has made great strides toward equality, racism still pervades the nation. Racism, we are not cured of it. And it s not just a matter of it not being polite to say nigger in public. That s not the measure of whether racism still exists or not,  Obama told comedian Marc Maron, who interviewed the president for his popular podcast on Friday and released their conversation online on Monday. It s not just a matter of overt discrimination. Societies don t, overnight, completely erase everything that happened 200 to 300 years prior. The legacy of slavery, Jim Crow, discrimination in almost every institution of our lives,  he continued,  that casts a long shadow and that s still part of our DNA that s passed on. Watch:Well, it appears that lifetime victims, Barack and Michelle Obama have finally broken the chains of oppression that have been holding them back since they moved from their mansion in Chicago in 2008, to the White House, and then to their multi-million pad in DC, as they set their sites on 2 separate pieces of VACANT land on Martha s Vineyard valued at $12 million and $15 million each.Word around the island is that the Obamas, who ve rented a place on the Vineyard for the past several summers, are looking to buy. The former first family has many friends on Martha s Vineyard   Harvard professors Henry Louis  Skip  Gates and Charles Ogletree, and former Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett, to name just a few   and they would like to own a place of their own on the island.The 44th president and his wife, Michelle, are believed to be focused  up island,  looking at homes or buildable lots in the rural communities of Aquinnah, Chilmark, and West Tisbury. (It s worth noting that the Obamas have always rented  up island,  including for a two-week stay this summer.)No one s talking, least of all realtors, but we re told that one property that may be getting a long look is a magnificent waterfront outpost in Aquinnah owned by Caroline Kennedy and her husband, Edwin Schlossberg. A few years ago, the couple, who inherited from Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis the 377-acre Red Gate Farm overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, subdivided the property and put two parcels on the market.Both are still available   but they don t come cheap. Sotheby s International Realty is listing a 75-acre parcel for $15 million, and a second 40-acre parcel for $12 million.The listing broker, George Ballantyne of Gibson Sotheby s International Realty, declined to talk to us. The properties appear on multiple sites, including Hancock Real Estate and Sand Piper Realty, which are both located on the Vineyard.  Boston Globe ",politics,"Sep 24, 2017"
"REVEALED: HOW BARACK OBAMA IS FUNDING The Resistance Movement Against President Trump","Wall Street might be shocked to learn it is helping bankroll the anti-Trump  resistance  movement that s aggressively fighting policies it favors   including corporate tax cuts and the repeal of Obama-era banking and health-care regulations.The payola is potentially earmarked for third-party interest groups approved by the Justice Department and HUD without requiring any proof of how the funds will be spent. Many of the recipients so far are radical leftist organizations who solicited the settlement cash from the administration even though they were not parties to the lawsuits, records show. During the Obama administration, groups committed to  revolutionary social change  sent proposals and met with high-level HUD and Justice Department officials to try to get their pieces of the settlement pie,  Cause of Action Institute vice president Julie Smith told The Post.Some of the chosen beneficiaries are now actively militating against the Trump administration and its policies, including:The Hispanic-rights group strenuously protested the Republican-led  skinny  repeal of the Affordable Care Act after receiving at least $1.5 million from the Obama regime s bank settlement funds, congressional researchers say.La Raza works closely with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and has teamed up with the anti-Trump resistance group, Indivisible, which was co-founded by La Raza alumnus Angel Padilla. Indivisible is working with La Raza and its affiliates to make sure  any bill that punishes sanctuary cities never goes to Trump s desk to become law.  They are encouraging activists to send postcards with pre-printed messages on immigration and health care to moderate GOP senators.NATIONAL URBAN LEAGUEAfter receiving at least $1.2 million from the bank-settlement slush fund, the African-American advocacy group solicited its supporters to oppose efforts to repeal ObamaCare by signing a letter to senators arguing  African-Americans stand to be disproportionately impacted.  It claimed more than 5 million black people would lose coverage under repeal legislation.NATIONAL COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT COALITIONSince hauling in at least $2.6 million in funds under settlement in the Obama-era mortgage suits, the liberal housing-rights group has slammed tax-reform proposals by the Trump administration as unfair, while trying to block efforts to privatize mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, claiming doing so would  deepen the racial wealth gap. NCRC is also actively lobbying against regulatory repeal of many provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.The Washington-based group boasts more than 600 member organizations who lobby lawmakers through list-serves, mailings, sign-on letters and conference calls. Though it s assumed that funds distributed to such  qualified organizations  will be used for housing assistance, the bank-settlement agreements do not enforce how the funds are spent. It stands to reason that some of the settlement funds have helped bankroll the resistance  bent on stopping the Trump agenda for America, Competitive Enterprise Institute senior fellow John Berlau said.It s not clear how much money, in all, has been diverted from settlement funds to these and other left-wing organizations. Attorney General Jeff Sessions has ordered a full audit of the funds while discontinuing the practice of funneling Justice Department settlements to third-party groups. Any settlement funds should go first to the victims and then to the American people [through the US Treasury]   not to bankroll third-party special interest groups or the political friends of whoever is in power,  Sessions said in a recent statement.Still, The Post has learned that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau continues to force financial institutions it prosecutes to donate to third-party community organizers. More, penalties in such cases are deposited into the Bureau s now-$170 million-plus Civil Penalty Fund, which has, in turn, channeled almost $30 million to  consumer advocacy  groups.For entire story: NYP ",politics,"Sep 24, 2017"

Wolfe, who is white, did not reference whether he agrees with the basis of the protest that gained steam Sunday following President Trump s condemnation: to object to the treatment of minorities in the United States.Entering Sunday, only one white player, Seth DeValve of Cleveland, had joined the movement. I stand because I respect the men who died in real battles so I have the freedom to battle on the field,  Wolfe, 27, told ESPN in a statement.  Paying tribute to the men and women who have given their lives for our freedom is why I stand. But everyone these days likes to find a reason to protest and that s their right. It s America and you are free to speak your mind. I just feel it s disrespectful to the ones who sacrificed their lives and it s the wrong platform. But like I said to each their own it s AMERICA! The greatest country in the world and if you don t think we are the greatest country in the world and you reside here, then why do you stay? A lot worse places in the world to call home. Proud to be an American. Several of his Broncos teammates took a kneel Sunday, days after Trump urged owners to kick the  son of a bitch  who protests off the team.

THE LEFT IS MAKING THIS ABOUT POLITICS BUT IT S ABOUT RESPECTING OUR FLAG AND ANTHEM FOR ALL AMERICANS PERIODMartha Ford spoke out against President Trump s announcement that NFL players should be  fired  if they refuse to stand for our anthem: Our game has long provided a powerful platform for dialogue and positive change in many communities throughout our nation. Thanks primarily to our players, the NFL also has been a unifying force in our country and impactful change has and hopefully will continue to be the result of peaceful expression, done so in order to highlight social injustices of all kind. Negative and disrespectful comments suggesting otherwise are contrary to the founding principles of our country, and we do not support those comments or opinions.

This is not a political stance but a  love of Country  stance. These players need to understand the difference and honor those who have fought and died for America.A Facebook fan has the best take on this yet:  THEN TAKE A KNEE Take a little trip to Valley Forge in January. Hold a musket ball in your fingers and imagine it piercing your flesh and breaking a bone or two. There won t be a doctor or trainer to assist you until after the battle, so just wait your turn. Take your cleats and socks off to get a real experience. Then take a knee.Then, take one at the beach in Normandy where man after American man stormed the beach, even as the one in front of him was shot to pieces the very sea stained with American blood. The only blockers most had were the dead bodies in front of them, riddled with bullets from enemy fire.Take a knee in the sweat soaked jungles of Vietnam. From Khe San to Saigon Anywhere will do. Americans died in all those jungles. There was no playbook that told them what was next, but they knew what flag they represented. When they came home, they were protested as well..and spit on for reasons only cowards know.Take another knee in the blood drenched sands of Fallujah in 110 degree heat..Wear your Kevlar helmet and battle dress..Your number won t be printed on it unless your number is up! You ll need to stay hydrated but there won t be anyone to squirt Gatorade into your mouth. You re on your own. There are a lot of places to take a knee Americans have given their lives all over the world. When you use the banner under which they fought as a source for your displeasure, you dishonor the memories of those who bled for the very freedoms you have. That s what the red stripes mean. It represents the blood of those who spilled a sea of it defending your liberty.While you re on your knee, pray for those that came before you, not on a manicured lawn striped and printed with numbers to announce every inch of ground taken but on nameless hills and bloodied beaches and sweltering forests and bitter cold mountains..every inch marked by an American life lost serving that flag you protest. No cheerleaders, no announcers, no coaches, no fans just American men and women delivering the real fight against those who chose to harm us blazing a path so you would have the right to  take a knee.  You haven t inkling what it took to get you where you are but your  protest  is duly noted. Not only is it disgraceful to a nation of real heroes, it serves the purpose of pointing to your ingratitude for those who chose to defend you under that banner that will still wave long after your jersey is retired If you really feel the need to take a knee, come with me to church on Sunday and we ll both kneel before Almighty God. We ll thank him for preserving this country for as long as He has. We ll beg forgiveness for our ingratitude for all He has provided us. We ll appeal to Him for understanding and wisdom. We ll pray for liberty and justice for all because He is the one who provides those things. But there will be no protest. There will only be gratitude for His provision and a plea for His continued grace and mercy on the land of the free and the home of the brave. It goes like this  GOD BLESS AMERICA!

Going to the White House is considered a great honor for a championship team.Stephen Curry is hesitating,therefore invitation is withdrawn!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 23, 2017President Trump should have also reminded the petulant Stephen Curry that there s a high likelihood most of his fans couldn t care less about his political opinions, and that whining to the media about not wanting to go visit the President (who was elected by the majority of Americans) at the White House will probably not help his brand for future marketing gigs.If Americans are fed up with professional sports turning into political arenas, they can start by turning off so-called  Sports networks  like Disney owned ESPN, whose hosts are nothing more than political hacks promoting the hate and giving these overpaid athletes political views more attention than they deserve.  Americans need to start turning off programs with controversial, race-obsessed hosts like Chris Hayes (who tweeted Curry s statement) and Trump-hating Jemele Hill who are more concerned about starting a race war in America than discussing sports.",politics,"Sep 23, 2017"
"Great Answer! Sean Spicer Asked To Name CNN Reporter Who Did Good Work During His Time In The Trump Administration","Sean Spicer was asked during a Washington Post interview,  which White House reporters  did good work . He was able to rattle off eight names and then said,  I m missing a bunch, for sure. Spicer was then asked if he forgot to include anyone from CNN who did good work during his time in the White House YOU KNEW THIS WAS COMING:Spicer gave the best answer ever Oh, no   We have to agree that the CNN correspondents have had it out for President Trump from day one. This is also  a dig at  combative WH correspondent Jim Acosta. How could we forget the exchanges with Acosta! A bulldog!CNN s Jim Acosta keeps trolling President Trump and keeps making a total fool of himself! The latest moment was after signing a trade bill when Acosta asked why the president didn t hold a press conference Trump s response is priceless!President Trump to @Acosta:  I like real news. Not fake news. You re fake news.  https://t.co/TssGvNyUct pic.twitter.com/sQ3IR8IRdX  CSPAN (@cspan) August 14, 2017REMEMBER THIS JIM ACOSTA MOMENT?We wish President Trump could clone SENIOR ADVISOR Stephen Miller! He s so brilliant and knows immigration like no other! We can t say the same for the White House Press Corp! The Trump administration made some positive announcements on immigration and the left went nuts! Miller got the best of them!ANOTHER GREAT TAKEDOWN!Fox News reported:Trump and Acosta have famously traded jabs since the president called Acosta  fake news  during a press conference earlier this year. If Spicer was going to compliment anyone from CNN, it would presumably have been the reporter he dealt with on a regular basis   but the former press secretary failed to mention Acosta when he had the chance.Acosta comes off as combative toward the White House on a regular basis and some insiders feel his grandstanding was one reason press briefings weren t televised over an extended period this summer. In addition to Trump and Spicer, Acosta sparred with White House adviser Stephen Miller last month over the administration s immigration policy. Miller famously accused the CNN reporter of having a  cosmopolitan bias. ",politics,"Sep 23, 2017"
"LAST MAN STANDINGS TIM ALLEN On Why He Wasnt Allowed To Call Obama A Communist On TV And Why Hillary Reminds Him Of HERPES","Before ABC cancelled Tim Allen s number one show  Last Man Standing,  Allen spoke with the Hollywood Reporter. They asked him why he has such strong political views. They wanted to know if he was a fan of Donald Trump s, what he thought of Hillary and Bill Clinton, and if it s really true that he wanted to run an episode that included raising a communist flag over the White House when Barack Obama was President. Whose idea was it for Mike Baxter to have loud, conservative political views?I brought that to the table. I wanted to be provocative. Mike Baxter is an educated Archie Bunker.Definitely. But you know what? I ve earned it. I don t say that lightly. I ve been on a successful show and learned from the best. But I find Last Man Standing actually rougher than Home Improvement. We re getting away with a lot of stuff. I m really shocked. This is a meaner, sharper comedy than I m used to. There s a lot of times our very liberal writing staff will come up with stuff that even my character would say,  I don t know if I can say that. How much is playing this right-leaning character an outlet for you to express your own political views?It s getting more and more comfortable. These guys know me so well that they re writing stuff that is exactly what I would ve said. It s a marvelous thing when you have lib eral people writing for [a show like this]. I believe Stephen Colbert was like that. He was pretending to be a conservative, I think. Someone said that. I never got that, but maybe I didn t watch it enough.Has the line between you and your character blurred over the years?For most of my life, I ve been taxed above 38 percent. When you re a young guy working the road and literally close to half of what you make goes to people who don t help you at all but just bitch about it the whole time, that s where I come from. I come from  no taxation without representation,  and it manifests itself in very peculiar points of view.How are you different from Mike?He s milder than I am. You wouldn t want to hear what I have to say. Escalate Mike Baxter with profanity and that s basically me. He s much more tepid because he s a business owner. Mike Baxter is calmed way down, and I m definitely not that guy.What riles you up the most?Unearned responses, unearned praise, unearned income: I have opinions about it. When you watch the debates, on both sides you see clowns who say shit that ain t ever going to happen, but lately, one party is the free shit party. They are just telling people they re going to get all sorts of free shit. When you say you re going to get free education, free healthcare   f , free brown loafers   of course, everybody s going to say yes to that.But you don t mean it. That s how you rack up debt, and debt is killing us. Whatever party is going to get us out of debt is my party.Who scares you?Well, we asked the female writing staff if they d vote for Hillary just because she s a woman, and they all said yes. So then the question was,  So if Sarah Palin was the female?  They all choked and they had to say,  Oh God, yes, we d vote for her.  I didn t quite buy it. I don t think you should vote for somebody just because they re tall, thin, yellow, green, whatever. Bernie Sanders, as nice a guy as he is, none of that shit s going to happen. And Trump can t send everybody to Mexico or whatever the f  he said. But give that guy the roads, bridges, infrastructure, power grid   just have him fix that shit for four years. He s good at that. And he s a businessman so he understands how debt load works. Forget the stupid shit he says about immigrants. That s just ignorant. But he might be able to do the stuff that really needs fixing.So you re not opposed to Trump?I m not opposed to anybody if their workload matches their bullshit load.Why has the show gone after Hillary but not Trump?It s a little surprising to me. We have a very liberal writing staff, so I m surprised they haven t taken a shot at him. But we re not sure he s going to last, whereas the Clintons are like herpes: Just when you think they re gone, they show up again.Didn t you try a bit about Obama raising the communist flag at the White House that never made it to air?We got network notes saying you can t call the president a communist. So, of course, I really wanted to. I do it in rehearsal all day long. ",politics,"Sep 23, 2017"

"Why John McCain Will Never Vote to Repeal and Replace Obamacare","It s all about the money isn t that the way it is with these RINO politicians who ve sold out the American people to big business? Well, John McCain is no different and should be taken to the woodshed one final time for his role in repeatedly destroying any hope we have of getting rid of Obamacare.BEWARE THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has paid millions to the GOP to keep Obamacare on behalf of multinational corporations who exploit and erode the U.S. economy. The largest beneficiaries of those payments has long been the RINOS within the senate. McCain s position is not a surprise. INSURERS PROFIT FROM OBAMACARE NO VOTE:Shares of U.S. insurers gained after news that McCain would not support the bill. Insurers had fallen over the past week as investors worried about spending cuts.Centene Corp gained 1.6 percent to $92.22 while Molina Healthcare rose 4.5 percent to $65.32. Both specialize in government-funded healthcare.The insurance industry, hospitals, medical advocacy groups such as the American Medical Association, American Heart Association and American Cancer Society, the AARP advocacy group for the elderly and consumer activists oppose the bill.WASHINGTON (Reuters)   U.S. Senator John McCain said on Friday he opposes the latest Republican bill to dismantle Obamacare, dealing the measure what could be a fatal blow given the party s slim Senate majority.With several other Republicans still undecided on the measure, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said earlier this week he intended to bring it to the Senate floor for a vote next week, though he did not promise to do so.A vote would set the stage for another dramatic Capitol Hill decision on the 2010 law that brought health insurance to millions of Americans and became former Democratic President Barack Obama s signature domestic achievement.Read more: Reuters ",politics,"Sep 22, 2017"

It will mean bridging  the technology gap  that persists in low-income districts. It requires revisions to the public-school system. And it warrants forming hiring committees with more women and people of color.  You can t just say you want to fix the problems, you have to mean it,  Obama said.  If a bunch of white guys are sitting around the table trying to get more women involved, they re not going to come up with the answer.  For Utah s Silicon Slopes and elsewhere, she added, a behavioral change in the office environment at IT corporations will need to accompany that shift.

Bharara joins CNN, a unit of Time Warner Inc, at a time when the cable network faces numerous accusations of being  fake news  from President Trump on Twitter.CNN declined to give further details on Bharara joining the network.Remember how he went after Dinesh D Souza? He is a ruthless and a very deceitful guy. The first thing that s highlighted inside my case file is  I m a conservative . This should be completely irrelevant in the decision whether to prosecute me. It should be beside the point. But of course in Bharara s case it was the point.

Bharara detailed the story of his firing for the first time, including how President Trump initially asked him to remain in his post after the election, and also spoke with former CIA Director Leon Panetta in the episode.Bharara may also address the circumstances of his firing in a book he is expected to publish in January 2019 with publisher Alfred A.

"Daniel Greenfield: Why Obama Really Spied On Trump: Its not just ideology. Its raw fear.","Daniel Greenfield s take on why Obama spied on Trump is the best yet. He takes you through the twists and turns to expose Obama and his cronies for the liars and cheats they are. We d love to know what you think about this take on why things happened the way they did:Last week, CNN revealed (and excused) one phase of the Obama spying operation on Trump. After lying about it on MSNBC, Susan Rice admitted unmasking the identities of Trump officials to Congress.ACKNOWLEDGED IN A LETTER FROM NUNES AND GOWDY:Rice was unmasking the names of Trump officials a month before leaving office. The targets may have included her own successor, General Flynn, who was forced out of office using leaked surveillance.SUSAN RICE LYING ABOUT THE UNMASKING   IS ANYONE SURPRISED? I know nothing about this. I was surprised to see reports from Chairman Nunes on that count today. What she says is a lie but who is surprised by this? We know that Susan Rice lied 5 times on 5 different morning shows the morning after Benghazi. Why wouldn t she try and cover this spying up to protect herself and others including Obama.Susan Rice is also giving conflicting stories on what she did so it might be a good idea for her to lawyer up right now. She claimed ignorance of the unmasking and spying but today she spoke about doing it. Yes, red flags are everywhere on this! The reality and truth is this was more of a political attack to destabilize the Trump presidency and embarrass him:Andrew McCarthy said it best: The national-security adviser is not an investigator. She is a White House staffer. The president s staff is a consumer of intelligence, not a generator or collector of it. If Susan Rice was unmasking Americans, it was not to fulfill an intelligence need based on American interests; it was to fulfill a political desire based on Democratic-party interests. GREENFIELD:  LAWS WERE BROKEN The bottom line is that laws were broken when the names were unmasked Someone s in BIG trouble! While Rice s targets weren t named, the CNN story listed a meeting with Flynn, Bannon and Kushner.Bannon was Trump s former campaign chief executive and a senior adviser. Kushner is a senior adviser. Those are exactly the people you spy on to get an insight into what your political opponents plan to do.Now the latest CNN spin piece informs us that secret FISA orders were used to spy on the conversations of Trump s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort (SEE CLAPPER VIDEO BELOW). The surveillance was discontinued for lack of evidence and then renewed under a new warrant. This is part of a pattern of FISA abuses by Obama Inc. which never allowed minor matters like lack of evidence to dissuade them from new FISA requests. Its possible  President Trump s voice was picked up in a wiretap of Paul Manafort, says former spy chief Clapper https://t.co/2ELM48axAa  CNN (@CNN) September 21, 2017Desperate Obama cronies had figured out that they could bypass many of the limitations on the conventional investigations of their political opponents by  laundering  them through national security.If any of Trump s people were talking to non-Americans, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) could be used to spy on them. And then the redacted names of the Americans could be unmasked by Susan Rice, Samantha Power and other Obama allies. It was a technically legal Watergate.If both CNN stories hold up, then Obama Inc. had spied on two Trump campaign leaders.Furthermore the Obama espionage operation closely tracked Trump s political progress. The first FISA request targeting Trump happened the month after he received the GOP nomination. The second one came through in October: the traditional month of political surprises meant to upend an election.The spying ramped up after Trump s win when the results could no longer be used to engineer a Hillary victory, but would instead have to be used to cripple and bring down President Trump. Headed out the door, Rice was still unmasking the names of Trump s people while Obama was making it easier to pass around raw eavesdropped data to other agencies.Obama had switched from spying on a political opponent to win an election, to spying on his successor to undo the results of the election.RICE AND POWER WERE USED TO  UNMASK  TRUMP ASSOCIATES    ALL THE PRESIDENT S WOMEN? Notice how uncomfortable Brennan is when asked about the Ambassador Power:Abuse of power by a sitting government had become subversion of the government by an outgoing administration. Domestic spying on opponents had become a coup.The Democrat scandals of the past few administrations have hinged on gross violations of political norms, elementary ethics and the rule of law that, out of context, were not technically illegal.But it s the pattern that makes the crime. It s the context that shows the motive.Obama Inc. compartmentalized its espionage operation in individual acts of surveillance and unmasking, and general policies implemented to aid both, that may have been individually legal, in the purely technical sense, in order to commit the major crime of eavesdropping on the political opposition.When the individual acts of surveillance are described as legal, that s irrelevant. It s the collective pattern of surveillance of the political opposition that exposes the criminal motive for them.If Obama spied on two of Trump s campaign leaders, that s not a coincidence. It s a pattern.A criminal motive can be spotted by a consistent pattern of actions disguised by different pretexts. A dirty cop may lose two pieces of evidence from the same defendant while giving two different excuses. A shady accountant may explain two otherwise identical losses in two different ways. Both excuses are technically plausible. But it s the pattern that makes the crime.Manafort was spied on under the Russia pretext. Bannon may have been spied on over the UAE. That s two different countries, two different people and two different pretexts.But one single target. President Trump.It s the pattern that exposes the motive.When we learn the whole truth (if we ever do), we will likely discover that Obama Inc. assembled a motley collection of different technically legal pretexts to spy on Trump s team.Each individual pretext might be technically defensible. But together they add up to the crime of the century.Obama s gamble was that the illegal surveillance would justify itself. If you spy on a bunch of people long enough, especially people in politics and business, some sort of illegality, actual or technical, is bound to turn up. That s the same gamble anyone engaged in illegal surveillance makes.Businessmen illegally tape conversations with former partners hoping that they ll say something damning enough to justify the risk. That was what Obama and his allies were doing with Trump.It s a crime. And you can t justify committing a crime by discovering a crime.If everyone were being spied on all the time, many crimes could be exposed every second. But that s not how our system works. That s why we have a Fourth Amendment.Nor was Obama Inc. trying to expose crimes for their own sake, but to bring down the opposition.That s why it doesn t matter what results the Obama surveillance turned up. The surveillance was a crime. Anything turned up by it is the fruit of a poisonous tree. It s inherently illegitimate.The first and foremost agenda must be to assemble a list of Trump officials who were spied on and the pretexts under which they were spied upon. The pattern will show the crime. And that s what Obama and his allies are terrified of. It s why Flynn was forced out using illegal surveillance and leaks. It s why McMaster is protecting Susan Rice and the Obama holdovers while purging Trump loyalists at the NSC.The left s gamble was that the Mueller investigation or some other illegitimate spawn of the Obama eavesdropping would produce an indictment and then the procedural questions wouldn t matter.It s the dirty cop using illegal eavesdropping to generate leads for a  clean  case against his target while betting that no one will look too closely or care how the case was generated. If one of the Mueller targets is intimidated into making a deal, the question of how the case was generated won t matter.Mueller will have a cooperative witness. And the Democrats can begin their coup in earnest. It will eventually turn out that there is no  there  there. But by then, it ll be time for President Booker.There s just one problem.If the gamble fails, if no criminal case that amounts to anything more than the usual investigational gimmick charges like perjury (the Federal equivalent of  resisting arrest  for a beat cop) develops, then Obama and his allies are on the hook for the domestic surveillance of their political opponents.With nothing to show for it and no way to distract from it.That s the race against the clock that is happening right now. Either the investigation gets results. Or its perpetrators are left hanging in the wind. If McMaster is fired, which on purely statistical grounds he probably will be, and a Trump loyalist who wasn t targeted by the surveillance operation becomes the next National Security Adviser and brings in Trump loyalists, as Flynn tried to do, then it s over.And the Dems finally get their Watergate. Except the star won t be Trump, it will be Obama. Rice, Power, Lynch and the rest of the gang will be the new Haldeman, Ehrlichman and Mitchell.Once Obama and his allies launched their domestic surveillance operation, they crossed the Rubicon. And there was no way back. They had to destroy President Trump or risk going to jail.The more crimes they committed by spying on the opposition, the more urgently they needed to bring down Trump. The consequences of each crime that they had committed spurred them on to commit worse crimes to save themselves from going to jail. It s the same old story when it comes to criminals.Each act of illegal surveillance became more blatant. And when illegal surveillance couldn t stop Trump s victory, they had to double down on the illegal surveillance for a coup.The more Obama spied on Trump, the more he had to keep doing it. This time it was bound to pay off.Obama and his allies had violated the norms so often for their policy goals that they couldn t afford to be replaced by anyone but one of their own. The more Obama relied on the imperial presidency of executive orders, the less he could afford to be replaced by anyone who would undo them. The more his staffers lied and broke the law on everything from the government shutdown to the Iran nuke sellout, the more desperately they needed to pull out all the stops to keep Trump out of office. And the more they did it, the more they couldn t afford not to do it. Abuse of power locks you into the loop familiar to all dictators. You can t stop riding the tiger. Once you start, you can t afford to stop.If you want to understand why Samantha Power was unmasking names, that s why. The hysterical obsession with destroying Trump comes from the top down. It s not just ideology. It s wealthy and powerful men and women who ran the country and are terrified that their crimes will be exposed.It s why the media increasingly sounds like the propaganda organs of a Communist country. Why there are street riots and why the internet is being censored by Google and Facebook s  fact checking  allies.It s not just ideology. It s raw fear.The left is sitting on the biggest crime committed by a sitting president. The only way to cover it up is to destroy his Republican successor.A turning point in history is here.If Obama goes down, the left will go down with him. If his coup succeeds, then America ends.Read more from Daniel Greenfield",politics,"Sep 21, 2017"
"GOP Official Drops Bombshell During Angry Debate With Lou Dobbs Over John Kelly [Video]","Top GOP Official Ed Rollins was interviewed by a very angry Lou Dobbs. He was furious with the ringside performance of John Kelly aka drama queen during President Trump s UN speech (some are saying it was before the speech).

HE VOTED FOR HILLARY CLINTON!Ed Rollins: At least what I ve heard from sources inside who know Kelly, he is an honorable man and a good general. He didn t vote for him. He voted for Hillary. So I don t think basically he is a Trump supporter or ideologically a Trump supporter.Whaaaaaat????? How can President Trump have a Chief of Staff that doesn t even follow his belief in policy?There is controversy over whether Kelly was was drama queen during or before Trump s speech. If it was before then this is a great case of the Democrats trying to sabotage Trump again.

"FBI and DOJ Refusing To Comply With Subpoena Over Trump Dossier&Hello Jeff Sessions?","Hello Jeff Sessions! Where is the DOJ s leader these days? Something tells us the Trump Dossier will end up being the bombshell that exposes Comey, Brennan and Clapper and all of the other criminals who used this dossier to spy on Trump. Obama used the dossier to spy on Trump!Anyone who followed the Obama White House intel policy outcomes will know that DNI Clapper and CIA Director John Brennan were the two primary political operatives weaponizing intelligence.But it gets better Comey comes into play:Remember the bombshell testimony of the Hermitage Capital CEO where the origin of the Fusion GPS  Russian Dossier  was discussed? CEO Browder stated the Russian government paid Fusion GPS to create the Steele propaganda dossier on candidate Donald Trump. That same dossier was used by the FBI in June/July 2016 to generate the FISA surveillance warrants against the Trump campaign. BOMBSHELL: Comey was using propaganda commissioned by Russia, funded in part by the FBI, to attack Trump, as the framework to launch his FBI investigation into candidate Donald Trump and Russian collusion.CEO BROWDER S ADMISSION BELOW:This is getting good.What does Nunes do now after several attempts at getting documents related to the dossier?After two previous deadlines came and went, House Intelligence Committee chairman Devin Nunes has set a new date for the FBI and Justice Department to turn over documents relating to the Trump dossier.Nunes originally subpoenaed the FBI and Justice on Aug. 24, demanding dossier documents by Sept. 1. When none were produced, Nunes agreed to extend the deadline to September 14. During that time, arrangements were made for intelligence committee investigators to visit the Justice Department to make sure officials on both sides understood precisely which documents the committee seeks.No documents were produced by Sept. 14, and now Nunes, apparently unsatisfied with the results of the staff meeting, has sent a new letter to FBI Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. In it, Nunes set a deadline of this Friday for the documents to be produced. If the documents are not produced by then, Nunes directed that Wray and Sessions appear in an open committee hearing Sept. 28, to explain why they did not hand over the materials.The document request in the original Aug. 24 subpoena has not changed. It focuses on the FBI s relations with Christopher Steele, the former British spy retained by the American opposition research firm Fusion GPS to dig dirt on Donald Trump in Russia as part of an effort funded by wealthy supporters of Hillary Clinton. Among other things, the original subpoena demanded all internal FBI reports  incorporating, relying on, or referring to  information provided by Steele, his sources, or Fusion GPS.The original subpoena also asked for  any information, if it exists, provided by Mr. Steele as an informant/source (confidential or otherwise) or in any other capacity,  as well as any documents relating to whether the FBI paid or offered any benefits to Steele. The subpoena also asked for all documents relating to FBI and Justice  efforts to corroborate, validate, or evaluate  information provided by Steele.Finally, the original subpoena requested any court applications for surveillance that included any information provided by Steele, plus any court orders, if there were any, that were based in any part on Steele s information.So far, the FBI and Justice Department have not provided the information. Now, they have a new deadline.Read more: WE",politics,"Sep 20, 2017"

"One for the Ages Full Video and Transcript of Trumps Incredible UN Speech [Video]","A speech for the ages was given today by President Donald Trump. He addressed the 72nd meeting of the United Nations General Assembly in New York for the first time in his presidency. The transcript is below.PRESIDENT TRUMP: Mr. Secretary General, Mr. President, world leaders, and distinguished delegates: Welcome to New York. It is a profound honor to stand here in my home city, as a representative of the American people, to address the people of the world.As millions of our citizens continue to suffer the effects of the devastating hurricanes that have struck our country, I want to begin by expressing my appreciation to every leader in this room who has offered assistance and aid. The American people are strong and resilient, and they will emerge from these hardships more determined than ever before.Fortunately, the United States has done very well since Election Day last November 8th. The stock market is at an all-time high   a record. Unemployment is at its lowest level in 16 years, and because of our regulatory and other reforms, we have more people working in the United States today than ever before. Companies are moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time. And it has just been announced that we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and defense.Our military will soon be the strongest it has ever been. For more than 70 years, in times of war and peace, the leaders of nations, movements, and religions have stood before this assembly. Like them, I intend to address some of the very serious threats before us today but also the enormous potential waiting to be unleashed.We live in a time of extraordinary opportunity. Breakthroughs in science, technology, and medicine are curing illnesses and solving problems that prior generations thought impossible to solve.But each day also brings news of growing dangers that threaten everything we cherish and value. Terrorists and extremists have gathered strength and spread to every region of the planet. Rogue regimes represented in this body not only support terrorists but threaten other nations and their own people with the most destructive weapons known to humanity.Authority and authoritarian powers seek to collapse the values, the systems, and alliances that prevented conflict and tilted the world toward freedom since World War II.International criminal networks traffic drugs, weapons, people; force dislocation and mass migration; threaten our borders; and new forms of aggression exploit technology to menace our citizens.To put it simply, we meet at a time of both of immense promise and great peril. It is entirely up to us whether we lift the world to new heights, or let it fall into a valley of disrepair.We have it in our power, should we so choose, to lift millions from poverty, to help our citizens realize their dreams, and to ensure that new generations of children are raised free from violence, hatred, and fear.This institution was founded in the aftermath of two world wars to help shape this better future. It was based on the vision that diverse nations could cooperate to protect their sovereignty, preserve their security, and promote their prosperity.It was in the same period, exactly 70 years ago, that the United States developed the Marshall Plan to help restore Europe. Those three beautiful pillars   they re pillars of peace, sovereignty, security, and prosperity.The Marshall Plan was built on the noble idea that the whole world is safer when nations are strong, independent, and free. As President Truman said in his message to Congress at that time,  Our support of European recovery is in full accord with our support of the United Nations. The success of the United Nations depends upon the independent strength of its members. To overcome the perils of the present and to achieve the promise of the future, we must begin with the wisdom of the past. Our success depends on a coalition of strong and independent nations that embrace their sovereignty to promote security, prosperity, and peace for themselves and for the world.We do not expect diverse countries to share the same cultures, traditions, or even systems of government. But we do expect all nations to uphold these two core sovereign duties: to respect the interests of their own people and the rights of every other sovereign nation. This is the beautiful vision of this institution, and this is foundation for cooperation and success.Strong, sovereign nations let diverse countries with different values, different cultures, and different dreams not just coexist, but work side by side on the basis of mutual respect.Strong, sovereign nations let their people take ownership of the future and control their own destiny. And strong, sovereign nations allow individuals to flourish in the fullness of the life intended by God.In America, we do not seek to impose our way of life on anyone, but rather to let it shine as an example for everyone to watch. This week gives our country a special reason to take pride in that example. We are celebrating the 230th anniversary of our beloved Constitution   the oldest constitution still in use in the world today.This timeless document has been the foundation of peace, prosperity, and freedom for the Americans and for countless millions around the globe whose own countries have found inspiration in its respect for human nature, human dignity, and the rule of law.The greatest in the United States Constitution is its first three beautiful words. They are:  We the people. Generations of Americans have sacrificed to maintain the promise of those words, the promise of our country, and of our great history. In America, the people govern, the people rule, and the people are sovereign. I was elected not to take power, but to give power to the American people, where it belongs.In foreign affairs, we are renewing this founding principle of sovereignty. Our government s first duty is to its people, to our citizens   to serve their needs, to ensure their safety, to preserve their rights, and to defend their values.As President of the United States, I will always put America first, just like you, as the leaders of your countries will always, and should always, put your countries first. (Applause.)All responsible leaders have an obligation to serve their own citizens, and the nation-state remains the best vehicle for elevating the human condition.But making a better life for our people also requires us to work together in close harmony and unity to create a more safe and peaceful future for all people.The United States will forever be a great friend to the world, and especially to its allies. But we can no longer be taken advantage of, or enter into a one-sided deal where the United States gets nothing in return. As long as I hold this office, I will defend America s interests above all else.But in fulfilling our obligations to our own nations, we also realize that it s in everyone s interest to seek a future where all nations can be sovereign, prosperous, and secure.America does more than speak for the values expressed in the United Nations Charter. Our citizens have paid the ultimate price to defend our freedom and the freedom of many nations represented in this great hall. America s devotion is measured on the battlefields where our young men and women have fought and sacrificed alongside of our allies, from the beaches of Europe to the deserts of the Middle East to the jungles of Asia.It is an eternal credit to the American character that even after we and our allies emerged victorious from the bloodiest war in history, we did not seek territorial expansion, or attempt to oppose and impose our way of life on others. Instead, we helped build institutions such as this one to defend the sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.For the diverse nations of the world, this is our hope. We want harmony and friendship, not conflict and strife. We are guided by outcomes, not ideology. We have a policy of principled realism, rooted in shared goals, interests, and values.That realism forces us to confront a question facing every leader and nation in this room. It is a question we cannot escape or avoid. We will slide down the path of complacency, numb to the challenges, threats, and even wars that we face. Or do we have enough strength and pride to confront those dangers today, so that our citizens can enjoy peace and prosperity tomorrow?If we desire to lift up our citizens, if we aspire to the approval of history, then we must fulfill our sovereign duties to the people we faithfully represent. We must protect our nations, their interests, and their futures. We must reject threats to sovereignty, from the Ukraine to the South China Sea. We must uphold respect for law, respect for borders, and respect for culture, and the peaceful engagement these allow. And just as the founders of this body intended, we must work together and confront together those who threaten us with chaos, turmoil, and terror.The scourge of our planet today is a small group of rogue regimes that violate every principle on which the United Nations is based. They respect neither their own citizens nor the sovereign rights of their countries.If the righteous many do not confront the wicked few, then evil will triumph. When decent people and nations become bystanders to history, the forces of destruction only gather power and strength.No one has shown more contempt for other nations and for the wellbeing of their own people than the depraved regime in North Korea. It is responsible for the starvation deaths of millions of North Koreans, and for the imprisonment, torture, killing, and oppression of countless more.We were all witness to the regime s deadly abuse when an innocent American college student, Otto Warmbier, was returned to America only to die a few days later. We saw it in the assassination of the dictator s brother using banned nerve agents in an international airport. We know it kidnapped a sweet 13-year-old Japanese girl from a beach in her own country to enslave her as a language tutor for North Korea s spies.If this is not twisted enough, now North Korea s reckless pursuit of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles threatens the entire world with unthinkable loss of human life.It is an outrage that some nations would not only trade with such a regime, but would arm, supply, and financially support a country that imperils the world with nuclear conflict. No nation on earth has an interest in seeing this band of criminals arm itself with nuclear weapons and missiles.The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea. Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime. The United States is ready, willing and able, but hopefully this will not be necessary. That s what the United Nations is all about; that s what the United Nations is for. Let s see how they do.It is time for North Korea to realize that the denuclearization is its only acceptable future. The United Nations Security Council recently held two unanimous 15-0 votes adopting hard-hitting resolutions against North Korea, and I want to thank China and Russia for joining the vote to impose sanctions, along with all of the other members of the Security Council. Thank you to all involved.But we must do much more. It is time for all nations to work together to isolate the Kim regime until it ceases its hostile behavior.We face this decision not only in North Korea. It is far past time for the nations of the world to confront another reckless regime   one that speaks openly of mass murder, vowing death to America, destruction to Israel, and ruin for many leaders and nations in this room.The Iranian government masks a corrupt dictatorship behind the false guise of a democracy. It has turned a wealthy country with a rich history and culture into an economically depleted rogue state whose chief exports are violence, bloodshed, and chaos. The longest-suffering victims of Iran s leaders are, in fact, its own people.Rather than use its resources to improve Iranian lives, its oil profits go to fund Hezbollah and other terrorists that kill innocent Muslims and attack their peaceful Arab and Israeli neighbors. This wealth, which rightly belongs to Iran s people, also goes to shore up Bashar al-Assad s dictatorship, fuel Yemen s civil war, and undermine peace throughout the entire Middle East.We cannot let a murderous regime continue these destabilizing activities while building dangerous missiles, and we cannot abide by an agreement if it provides cover for the eventual construction of a nuclear program. (Applause.) The Iran Deal was one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into. Frankly, that deal is an embarrassment to the United States, and I don t think you ve heard the last of it   believe me.It is time for the entire world to join us in demanding that Iran s government end its pursuit of death and destruction. It is time for the regime to free all Americans and citizens of other nations that they have unjustly detained. And above all, Iran s government must stop supporting terrorists, begin serving its own people, and respect the sovereign rights of its neighbors.The entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change, and, other than the vast military power of the United States, that Iran s people are what their leaders fear the most. This is what causes the regime to restrict Internet access, tear down satellite dishes, shoot unarmed student protestors, and imprison political reformers.Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people will face a choice. Will they continue down the path of poverty, bloodshed, and terror? Or will the Iranian people return to the nation s proud roots as a center of civilization, culture, and wealth where their people can be happy and prosperous once again?The Iranian regime s support for terror is in stark contrast to the recent commitments of many of its neighbors to fight terrorism and halt its financing.In Saudi Arabia early last year, I was greatly honored to address the leaders of more than 50 Arab and Muslim nations. We agreed that all responsible nations must work together to confront terrorists and the Islamist extremism that inspires them.We will stop radical Islamic terrorism because we cannot allow it to tear up our nation, and indeed to tear up the entire world.We must deny the terrorists safe haven, transit, funding, and any form of support for their vile and sinister ideology. We must drive them out of our nations. It is time to expose and hold responsible those countries who support and finance terror groups like al Qaeda, Hezbollah, the Taliban and others that slaughter innocent people.The United States and our allies are working together throughout the Middle East to crush the loser terrorists and stop the reemergence of safe havens they use to launch attacks on all of our people.Last month, I announced a new strategy for victory in the fight against this evil in Afghanistan. From now on, our security interests will dictate the length and scope of military operations, not arbitrary benchmarks and timetables set up by politicians.I have also totally changed the rules of engagement in our fight against the Taliban and other terrorist groups. In Syria and Iraq, we have made big gains toward lasting defeat of ISIS. In fact, our country has achieved more against ISIS in the last eight months than it has in many, many years combined.We seek the de-escalation of the Syrian conflict, and a political solution that honors the will of the Syrian people. The actions of the criminal regime of Bashar al-Assad, including the use of chemical weapons against his own citizens   even innocent children   shock the conscience of every decent person. No society can be safe if banned chemical weapons are allowed to spread. That is why the United States carried out a missile strike on the airbase that launched the attack.We appreciate the efforts of United Nations agencies that are providing vital humanitarian assistance in areas liberated from ISIS, and we especially thank Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon for their role in hosting refugees from the Syrian conflict.The United States is a compassionate nation and has spent billions and billions of dollars in helping to support this effort. We seek an approach to refugee resettlement that is designed to help these horribly treated people, and which enables their eventual return to their home countries, to be part of the rebuilding process.For the cost of resettling one refugee in the United States, we can assist more than 10 in their home region. Out of the goodness of our hearts, we offer financial assistance to hosting countries in the region, and we support recent agreements of the G20 nations that will seek to host refugees as close to their home countries as possible. This is the safe, responsible, and humanitarian approach.For decades, the United States has dealt with migration challenges here in the Western Hemisphere. We have learned that, over the long term, uncontrolled migration is deeply unfair to both the sending and the receiving countries.For the sending countries, it reduces domestic pressure to pursue needed political and economic reform, and drains them of the human capital necessary to motivate and implement those reforms.For the receiving countries, the substantial costs of uncontrolled migration are borne overwhelmingly by low-income citizens whose concerns are often ignored by both media and government.I want to salute the work of the United Nations in seeking to address the problems that cause people to flee from their homes. The United Nations and African Union led peacekeeping missions to have invaluable contributions in stabilizing conflicts in Africa. The United States continues to lead the world in humanitarian assistance, including famine prevention and relief in South Sudan, Somalia, and northern Nigeria and Yemen.We have invested in better health and opportunity all over the world through programs like PEPFAR, which funds AIDS relief; the President s Malaria Initiative; the Global Health Security Agenda; the Global Fund to End Modern Slavery; and the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, part of our commitment to empowering women all across the globe.We also thank   (applause)   we also thank the Secretary General for recognizing that the United Nations must reform if it is to be an effective partner in confronting threats to sovereignty, security, and prosperity. Too often the focus of this organization has not been on results, but on bureaucracy and process.In some cases, states that seek to subvert this institution s noble aims have hijacked the very systems that are supposed to advance them. For example, it is a massive source of embarrassment to the United Nations that some governments with egregious human rights records sit on the U.N. Human Rights Council.The United States is one out of 193 countries in the United Nations, and yet we pay 22 percent of the entire budget and more. In fact, we pay far more than anybody realizes. The United States bears an unfair cost burden, but, to be fair, if it could actually accomplish all of its stated goals, especially the goal of peace, this investment would easily be well worth it.Major portions of the world are in conflict and some, in fact, are going to hell. But the powerful people in this room, under the guidance and auspices of the United Nations, can solve many of these vicious and complex problems.The American people hope that one day soon the United Nations can be a much more accountable and effective advocate for human dignity and freedom around the world. In the meantime, we believe that no nation should have to bear a disproportionate share of the burden, militarily or financially. Nations of the world must take a greater role in promoting secure and prosperous societies in their own regions.That is why in the Western Hemisphere, the United States has stood against the corrupt and destabilizing regime in Cuba and embraced the enduring dream of the Cuban people to live in freedom. My administration recently announced that we will not lift sanctions on the Cuban government until it makes fundamental reforms.We have also imposed tough, calibrated sanctions on the socialist Maduro regime in Venezuela, which has brought a once thriving nation to the brink of total collapse.The socialist dictatorship of Nicolas Maduro has inflicted terrible pain and suffering on the good people of that country. This corrupt regime destroyed a prosperous nation by imposing a failed ideology that has produced poverty and misery everywhere it has been tried. To make matters worse, Maduro has defied his own people, stealing power from their elected representatives to preserve his disastrous rule.The Venezuelan people are starving and their country is collapsing. Their democratic institutions are being destroyed. This situation is completely unacceptable and we cannot stand by and watch.As a responsible neighbor and friend, we and all others have a goal. That goal is to help them regain their freedom, recover their country, and restore their democracy. I would like to thank leaders in this room for condemning the regime and providing vital support to the Venezuelan people.The United States has taken important steps to hold the regime accountable. We are prepared to take further action if the government of Venezuela persists on its path to impose authoritarian rule on the Venezuelan people.We are fortunate to have incredibly strong and healthy trade relationships with many of the Latin American countries gathered here today. Our economic bond forms a critical foundation for advancing peace and prosperity for all of our people and all of our neighbors.I ask every country represented here today to be prepared to do more to address this very real crisis. We call for the full restoration of democracy and political freedoms in Venezuela. (Applause.)The problem in Venezuela is not that socialism has been poorly implemented, but that socialism has been faithfully implemented. (Applause.) From the Soviet Union to Cuba to Venezuela, wherever true socialism or communism has been adopted, it has delivered anguish and devastation and failure. Those who preach the tenets of these discredited ideologies only contribute to the continued suffering of the people who live under these cruel systems.America stands with every person living under a brutal regime. Our respect for sovereignty is also a call for action. All people deserve a government that cares for their safety, their interests, and their wellbeing, including their prosperity.In America, we seek stronger ties of business and trade with all nations of good will, but this trade must be fair and it must be reciprocal.For too long, the American people were told that mammoth multinational trade deals, unaccountable international tribunals, and powerful global bureaucracies were the best way to promote their success. But as those promises flowed, millions of jobs vanished and thousands of factories disappeared. Others gamed the system and broke the rules. And our great middle class, once the bedrock of American prosperity, was forgotten and left behind, but they are forgotten no more and they will never be forgotten again.While America will pursue cooperation and commerce with other nations, we are renewing our commitment to the first duty of every government: the duty of our citizens. This bond is the source of America s strength and that of every responsible nation represented here today.If this organization is to have any hope of successfully confronting the challenges before us, it will depend, as President Truman said some 70 years ago, on the  independent strength of its members.  If we are to embrace the opportunities of the future and overcome the present dangers together, there can be no substitute for strong, sovereign, and independent nations   nations that are rooted in their histories and invested in their destinies; nations that seek allies to befriend, not enemies to conquer; and most important of all, nations that are home to patriots, to men and women who are willing to sacrifice for their countries, their fellow citizens, and for all that is best in the human spirit.In remembering the great victory that led to this body s founding, we must never forget that those heroes who fought against evil also fought for the nations that they loved.Patriotism led the Poles to die to save Poland, the French to fight for a free France, and the Brits to stand strong for Britain.Today, if we do not invest ourselves, our hearts, and our minds in our nations, if we will not build strong families, safe communities, and healthy societies for ourselves, no one can do it for us.We cannot wait for someone else, for faraway countries or far-off bureaucrats   we can t do it. We must solve our problems, to build our prosperity, to secure our futures, or we will be vulnerable to decay, domination, and defeat.The true question for the United Nations today, for people all over the world who hope for better lives for themselves and their children, is a basic one: Are we still patriots? Do we love our nations enough to protect their sovereignty and to take ownership of their futures? Do we revere them enough to defend their interests, preserve their cultures, and ensure a peaceful world for their citizens?One of the greatest American patriots, John Adams, wrote that the American Revolution was  effected before the war commenced. The Revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people. That was the moment when America awoke, when we looked around and understood that we were a nation. We realized who we were, what we valued, and what we would give our lives to defend. From its very first moments, the American story is the story of what is possible when people take ownership of their future.The United States of America has been among the greatest forces for good in the history of the world, and the greatest defenders of sovereignty, security, and prosperity for all.Now we are calling for a great reawakening of nations, for the revival of their spirits, their pride, their people, and their patriotism.History is asking us whether we are up to the task. Our answer will be a renewal of will, a rediscovery of resolve, and a rebirth of devotion. We need to defeat the enemies of humanity and unlock the potential of life itself.Our hope is a word and world of proud, independent nations that embrace their duties, seek friendship, respect others, and make common cause in the greatest shared interest of all: a future of dignity and peace for the people of this wonderful Earth.This is the true vision of the United Nations, the ancient wish of every people, and the deepest yearning that lives inside every sacred soul.So let this be our mission, and let this be our message to the world: We will fight together, sacrifice together, and stand together for peace, for freedom, for justice, for family, for humanity, and for the almighty God who made us all.Thank you. God bless you. God bless the nations of the world. And God bless the United States of America. Thank you very much.",politics,"Sep 19, 2017"
"NFLS PHONY PATRIOTISM: US Defense Department Paid NFL DISGUSTING $4.5 Million For On-Field Flag Appearances&Welcome Home Tributes","Every day, the NFL gives fans another reason to stop supporting them. Although the NFL agreed to refund a small portion of the money our Defense Department (US taxpayers) have paid them to show support for our military, it s the idea that Americans have been duped into believing it was something they did out of honor or reverence for our military. The NFL has reached a new low with their acceptance of players who are disrespecting our flag to promote Obama s race war while disallowing the Dallas Cowboys to honor the 5 police officers slain in their hometown by a Black Lives Matter terrorist. Don t forget, they also looked away when Cleveland Brown s player, Isaiah Crowell posted an Instagram picture of a cop with his neck being slit open. The NFL never said a word. They never even acknowledged what some considered to be a terrorist type threat to our law enforcement.In May 2016, the NFL announced that they would return more than $700,000 of taxpayers  money that was paid to teams for sponsored military tributes.After being criticized for  paid patriotism,  in which money came out of the armed forces budget for various measures of public recognition during games, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said that the league would pay that money back.In a letter written to Senators Jeff Flake and John McCain on Wednesday, and disclosed on Thursday, Goodell said that   following an audited review of 100 marketing agreements from 2012 to 2015 by accounting firm Deloitte & Touche   teams were deemed to have received $723,734 for acts of sponsored patriotism. Given the immense sacrifices made by our service members, it seems more appropriate that any organization with a genuine interest in honoring them, and deriving public credit as a result, should do so at its own expense and not at that of the American taxpayer,  the report said.  Americans deserve the ability to assume that tributes for our men and women in military uniform are genuine displays of national pride, which many are, rather than taxpayer-funded DOD marketing gimmicks.   PGLast year, Flake and McCain disclosed that the U.S. Department of Defense had spent $5.4 million in contracts with 14 NFL teams from 2011 to 2014. Some of those contracts disclosed that payment was for on-field flag ceremonies and tributes to welcome home veterans. One team, the Atlanta Falcons, had made more than $1 million from the department over those four seasons.The National Guard spent $6.7 million on contracts with NFL teams from 2013 to 2015.

"ILLINOIS: ENTIRE TEAM OF 8-Yr Old Kids Perform Disgusting Act of Disrespect For Our Flag and Law Enforcement Under Guidance Of Coach","Every player on the Cahokia Quarterback Club football team (8 and under) took a knee during the national anthem ahead of Sunday s game at Little Devil s Field in Belleville. One of the kids asked me if I saw (people) protesting and rioting in St. Louis. I said yes; I said,  Do you know why they are doing it?  said Coach Orlando Gooden.Coach Gooden said his player responded,  Because black people are getting killed and nobody s going to jail. Gooden, who played football at Mizzou, said the kids knew about the Jason Stockley decision. I felt like it was a good teaching moment for me to circle the team and have a meeting,  he said.Watch:Here are just a few shocking statistics the coach could have shared with his players about neighboring E. St. Louis, IL:WND- Before Ferguson exploded in reaction to the August shooting of black teen Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson, the St. Louis police chief raised eyebrows when he called for the use of drones to monitor high-crime areas.The proposal was a response to what St. Louis police authorities called  subhuman, antisocial, urban terrorist  behavior by criminals.St. Louis also is homeof the notorious  Knockout Game,  a random but racially motivated assault that has claimed at least six lives.St. Louis is 44 percent white and 49 percent black, but statistics shows a racial imbalance in crime. Based on the city s official crime data for 2012   the most recent year which data are available   97.6 percent of those arrested for murder were black and 2.4 percent were white. More than 82 percent of those arrested for serious crimes like murder, aggravated assault and larceny were black, while just 17.5 percent arrested were white.Black males in St. Louis were responsible for the vast majority (63.5 percent) of crimes committed. Other groups contribute significantly less to the serious crimes in St. Louis. White males made up 17 percent of arrests, black females were 14 percent of arrests and white females only 5.3 percent of arrests.There are other strange imbalances in arrests: Black females were arrested for 14 murders compared with three white males arrested for murder. Black females were arrested for more robberies, aggravated assaults and larcenies than white males.These are just a few of the lowlights in a city on the verge of becoming, as U.S. News said, the most dangerous city in America.Consider one violent night in St. Louis last June when 18 people were shot in seven different shootings. Bloody Night Leaves Many in St. Louis Outraged  read one headline.However, some of the shooting victims were not outraged enough to cooperate with law enforcement. St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay described the  no snitchin  mentality of many crime victims: These are disputes, and there are victims who won t talk to the police,  the mayor said.  Trying to make an arrest isn t that simple. In one case, they ve got (multiple) people shot and not one of them would identify the shooter. Slay remarked,  In the vast majority of these cases, people are using their guns to settle their own petty feuds, and that s really what s very unfortunate and outrageous about this. Local news reported on a shooting in a housing complex involving an AK-47 in which  a black male armed with the AK-47 came around the corner [and] started shooting  at an 18-year-old woman and four of her friends.Juanita Sparks, 60, of St. Louis told reporters,  I am tired of thugs. Colin Gordon, author of  Mapping Decline: St. Louis and the Fate of the American City,  calls St. Louis  the poster child of white flight.  However, middle- and upper-middle class blacks are also leaving the city in significant numbers.The Cahokia football coach, who had the perfect opportunity to educate these young minds about getting a good education and staying away from a dead-end life of crime, instead, took the opportunity to disrespect the law enforcement officers tasked with protecting these crime-ridden neighborhoods.  The coach said he spoke to them about that and other situations that have happened in our country. He then explained why former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick started kneeling during the anthem.

"LIBERAL HOLLYWOOD IMPLODES! Ratings Are In For The Trump-Bashing Emmys&Insignificant Celebrities Are Dealt MAJOR BLOW!","This summer s box office numbers were the worst they ve been in over 25 years, and now this   KNOCK, KNOCK! Who s there? Karma Adjustments might take a little of the sting out of the news that Sunday night s Emmy telecast was a ratings catastrophe, but any adjustment will only make the nightmare a little less nightmarish. Instead of being the lowest-watched Emmys in its 69-year history, Sunday night s telecast might be able to squeak into the second-lowest.As of now, though, it looks as though all that promised Trump-hating resulted in a record low, which is especially shocking (at least to bubbled Hollywood) because last year everyone was certain the bottom had been hit.Regardless, the die is cast. Last night was yet-another ratings flop for Hollywood s Beautiful People. As of now, it looks as though fewer than 11.3 million viewers tuned in to watch host Stephen Colbert s hate-fest. That would mean the 69th Emmy telecast had fewer viewers than last year s 68th, which currently holds the all-time low ratings record.What we do know for sure is that the 8.2 overnight rating is lower than 2016 s 8.4. Even in the coveted 18-49 age group, TVs Greatest Night flopped with a pathetic 2.8, which proves that even young people are tired of watching rich elites publicly work through their inability to come to terms with losing the 2016 presidential election.This news, of course, comes just days after the ratings for the MTV Awards hit their own record low.What has to be especially galling to Colbert and his fellow social justice glitter-warriors, is that in a country of 330 million, fewer than five percent tuned in, cared to watch even a minute of the show, was not in the least interested in their Big Thinks on issues n  stuff, including President Trump who, despite the unrelenting hate campaigns from the media and Hollywood, still holds (if you believe the polls) a 40% approval rating. We all know it is higher, especially in the only states that matter.As Hollywood has gotten more political, more divisive, more bigoted towards Normal People, and more hateful, take a look at the nuclear fallout. America is more red, more Republican-led than at any time since Reconstruction. On every level, Democrats have been wiped out of electoral office.

Such warrants require the approval of top Justice Department and FBI officials, and the FBI must provide the court with information showing suspicion that the subject of the warrant may be acting as an agent of a foreign power. Very wrong!PAUL MANAFORT WIRETAPPED US investigators wiretapped former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort under secret court orders before and after the election, sources tell CNN, an extraordinary step involving a high-ranking campaign official now at the center of the Russia meddling probe.The government snooping continued into early this year, including a period when Manafort was known to talk to President Donald Trump. Some of the intelligence collected includes communications that sparked concerns among investigators that Manafort had encouraged the Russians to help with the campaign, according to three sources familiar with the investigation. Two of these sources, however, cautioned that the evidence is not conclusive.Special counsel Robert Mueller s team, which is leading the investigation into Russia s involvement in the election, has been provided details of these communications.A secret order authorized by the court that handles the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) began after Manafort became the subject of an FBI investigation that began in 2014. It centered on work done by a group of Washington consulting firms for Ukraine s former ruling party, the sources told CNN. The surveillance was discontinued at some point last year for lack of evidence, according to one of the sources.The FBI then restarted the surveillance after obtaining a new FISA warrant that extended at least into early this year. Sources say the second warrant was part of the FBI s efforts to investigate ties between Trump campaign associates and suspected Russian operatives.

"LOOK WHO THE VIEW HIRED To Replace Only Conservative On Their Panel After She Dared To Ask Hillary The Wrong Question [VIDEO]","Jedediah Bila is at most, a lukewarm conservative. She s a hardcore Trump hater, so the show gave her a little leeway when it came to expressing her lukewarm conservative views. Apparently, no one gave her permission, however, to ask Hillary Clinton to accept some responsibility for her loss during a taped segment last week.When Hillary agreed to appear on The View to hawk her new book,  What Happened  that explains why everyone else is to blame after was clobbered in the 2016 presidential election by Donald J. Trump, she certainly didn t expect to be challenged by the token conservative, who clearly hates President Trump. In other words, Hillary and likely the entire panel of dingbats on The View believed she was entering a  safe space , but that didn t turn out to be the case, as Bila zinged her with an unexpected question, that forced Hillary to scramble for an acceptable answer to her question. Of course, Hillary s answer had nothing whatsoever to do with the question Bila asked her, as Hillary hilariously attempted to blame the media for her loss. The 5:30 point is where Bila crosses Hillary Not surprisingly only one week after Bila s question of Hillary, the token conservative host finds herself in the unemployment line, while Meghan McCain, the daughter of one of the worst RINO s in the Senate will be taking Bila s spot, as the lukewarm conservative on the panel of hosts with the dingbats of The View.Meghan McCain told liberal rag PEOPLE magazine that she shed tears when Donald Trump officially won the GOP nomination for president at the Republican convention.For anyone who thinks Bila expected to be exiting The View, a quick look at a couple of her most recent posts on Facebook show that she was gearing up for the next season with the dingbats at The View:Only 5 days ago, Bila posted about hoping that Hillary would come back to discuss the issues with her:Most of her questions were softball questions and she spent a great deal of time trashing our president, but something happened lately, as Jedediah seemed to be actually defending her conservative principles. She recently challenged the racist, Trump-hating CA Congresswoman, Maxine Waters and her over-the-top rhetoric about our sitting President. The hyena s on the panel and the clapping seals in the audience would have nothing to do with an opinion that is contrary to anything other than the hard left. Why Bila put up with those dingbats for so many seasons is a mystery to many who watched. Apparently hating Donald Trump is enough to land a semi-talented female a coveted seat at The View s leftist propaganda table.Watch:Maybe it was just the Clinton interview that ended her career, or maybe it was a combination of the Waters and then Clinton interviews, either way, The View can sit back and rest easy, as Meghan McCain doesn t have a conservative bone in her body, and the  Goebbels Sisters  can now carry on, uninterrupted with their disinformation campaign about President Trump and about the American people who support him.",politics,"Sep 18, 2017"

"WHOA! BILL OREILLY DROPS BOMBSHELL Report About Key Accuser In Sexual Harassment Case That Could Prove He Was Unjustly FIRED By FOX News","Bill O Reilly needs to ask the investigators assigned to defend him in a sexual harassment case that eventually led to his firing for a full refund. O Reilly s reputation, as well as his career, were destroyed by a woman, who it turns out, is not only a two-bit phony, but a liar as well.O Reilly tweeted,  Sorry to have to post this article but it is necessary to expose the evil in play in this country. More to come.  after Newsmax broke the story about a key accuser in the O Reilly sexual harassment case that eventually led to his firing by the liberal Murdoch brothers at the Fox News network.Newsmax has obtained two documents that cast doubt on Burgess s credibility.A Detroit Police report dated Feb. 11, 2015, documents Burgess s arrest on charges of making a false report and obstructing a court order.According to the police document, Burgess called authorities and alleged her boyfriend had struck her in the face with a gun. Police said when they arrived at the scene Burgess  appeared intoxicated. The arresting officer stated:  I asked Ms. Burgess where the gun was that she was struck with in the face, she replied there is no gun. I again asked her where the gun was, and if she had been assaulted. Ms. Burgess stated there was no gun, and he didn t assault me! The boyfriend told police she had threatened him, saying she would call  the cops saying you hit me with a gun! According to the police document, Burgess was arrested for filing a false felony report and for violating a personal protection order.In a statement provided to Newsmax, Lisa Bloom, Burgess s attorney, acknowledges the police report involving her client, but states that Burgess and her former boyfriend  both believe the charges were based on a misunderstanding and were not pursued by the police or prosecutors. In another document, a social media user thought to be Burgess tweeted on Nov. 24, 2012:   up until 10 years ago Laurence Fishburne could get every oz. of my hot chocolate. Addressing that tweet, Bloom stated:  Ms. Burgess has used many terms to refer to herself, including on occasion  bitch  and the N word. That does not give others   especially her superiors in her workplace   permission to use offensive language about her. Here is attorney Lisa Bloom celebrating with her client, Perquita Burgess who we now know, has a history of filing false reports against men:With my beautiful and brave client Perquita Burgess as she walked through her fear and emerged triumphant yesterday. pic.twitter.com/Qw1wihd0zh  Lisa Bloom (@LisaBloom) April 21, 2017In April, O Reilly was fired from Fox News shortly after Perquita Burgess claimed the host made sexually suggestive comments to her, including calling her  hot chocolate. Burgess worked at Fox News for several weeks in 2008 as a clerical temp.Shortly after an April 1st New York Times report detailed sexual harassment allegations by several women against O Reilly, Burgess called a 21st Century Fox hotline claiming alleged workplace misconduct by O Reilly. 21st Century is the parent company of Fox News.At the time her charges emerged, O Reilly s program,  The O Reilly Factor,  was already in the throes of an advertiser-boycott campaign being pushed by several liberal organizations. I had no idea who this woman was,  O Reilly told Newsmax. O Reilly denied ever having a conversation with her. So when it came out, it was stunning,  he said.The day after O Reilly was fired, Burgess went public with her account in a high-profile appearance on ABC s  The View.   NewsmaxBill O Reilly accuser Perquita Burgess told the dingbats at The View that she felt triumphant when the Fox News Channel host was fired following an investigation into claims of harassment by women. Perquita Burgess, a former clerical worker at Fox, went on  The View  Thursday to talk about encounters with O Reilly nine years ago.Watch Perquita tell The View dingbats how Bill O Reilly allegedly calling her  Hot chocolate  is racist.  Not only was it sexual, I took that as very  plantational  remark. You know, I ve been around enough racism, whatever. ",politics,"Sep 17, 2017"

Security scrambled and beat the piss out of the unidentified puncher.While all the attention was on the nasty rapper who got knocked out, the person who cold-cocked him on stage was pummeled by security. Is it part of the security detail s job to mob beat anyone who harms the performer they ve been hired to protect, or is it their job to capture and detain him until the proper authorities have arrived? Let s hope this guy who jumped on stage and gave this disgusting rapper a little dose of karma has a good lawyer because he needs to sue those security guards for using excessive force XX was eventually carried offstage. One of his tour managers tells us he was unconscious for at least 2 minutes.

"Comedian Adam Carolla Slams NYC Mayor de Blasios Statue Commission","Thank goodness for a little common sense! Adam Carolla is spot on in his rant over the ridiculous  statue commission  that the NYC Mayor has created to point out any  oppressive  landmarks in the city. Here s his take on the idiocy of the censorship:Comedian Adam Carolla thinks Mayor Bill de Blasio s statue commission belongs in the toilet.He can t understand the outrage the mayor and others have toward historical statues  displayed in cities  but are mum about the art installation where people can poop on a golden toilet called  America.  PHOTO BELOWThe Guggenheim wants you to crap all over  America Here s a novel idea     I would say to de Blaiso, I will support him and his statue quest   if he supports the commission I put together to see what gets into the Guggenheim,  Carolla quipped in an exclusive interview with the New York Post.Carolla s become an outspoken critic    even  testifying before Congress this year   of Americans who get so easily offended that they want to shut down anything th ey deem  controversial.He s making a movie about coddled college students who can t tolerate free speech on campus.GO SEE THIS GUY!He ll be in Brooklyn Nov. 29 for a show his with radio host Dennis Prager. Carolla sees similarities between college uprisings over conservative speakers like Ann Coulter, Ben Shapiro and  Milo Yiannopoulos and the current war against statues in the Big Apple. How come the same people who are outraged over the  Columbus statue have no feelings toward the golden toilet that people defecate in called  America  after so many people   men and women, veterans   have given their lives to that golden toilet,  Carolla said.  Why no outrage in that department?! PICTURED BELOW: THE STATUE WAS VANDALIZED WITH RED PAINT AND BLACK WRITING:  HATE WILL NOT BE TOLERATED  and #SOMETHINGSCOMINGThe Central Park Columbus statue was vandalized last week with red paint on the explorer s hands. Meanwhile, de Blasio has vowed to find the city s  oppressive  landmarks and tag them for potential removal with a new commission: OPPRESSIVE  MONUMENTS?  Mayor de Blasio named a diverse group of 18 artists, historians and other professionals to take hold of what s become a political hot potato.Hizzoner dubbed Ford Foundation President Darren Walker and the city s Department of Cultural Affairs commissioner Tom Finkelpearl as co-chairs of the panel.The body includes an anthropologist of the Native American Mohawk people, a historian of Chinese American people in New York, and the director of a gay and lesbian art museum.Longtime de Blasio supporter Harry Belafonte   an entertainer and civil rights advocate who had a Manhattan library named in his honor in May   was also tapped to join the commission. Over the next 90 days, the commission will develop guidelines on how the City should address monuments seen as oppressive and inconsistent with the values of New York City,  the mayor s office said in a press release on Friday.CAROLLA S IDEA:Carolla suggests keeping the statues but adding educational plaques around the controversial figures who were on the wrong side of history and maybe even a warning:  You don t want this to be you one day.

"WATCH: FOX and FRIENDS Host BRIAN KILMEADE Immediately Makes WHOOPI Regret Telling Him To Read A Book","You almost have to feel sorry for Whoopi Goldberg. Her emotional arguments are no match for the very smart conservative Brian Kilmeade, who prefers to use facts and rely on actual history to support his positions.On the 16th anniversary of 9/11, Fox News  Brian Kilmeade asked Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke about the future of the 9/11 Memorial given the current climate of removing memorials that negatively affect some snowflake s politically correct sentimentalities. Do you worry 100 years from now that someone s going to try and take that memorial down like they re trying to remake our memorials today?  Kilmeade asked. I m one that believes we should learn from history,  Zinke responded,  and I think our monuments are part of our country s history. We can learn from it. And since we don t put up statues of Jesus, everyone s going to fall morally short, and I think reflecting on our history, both good and bad, is a powerful statement and part of our DNA. The next day on The View, co-host Whoopi Goldberg had a few choice words for Kilmeade Victims, 9/11. Perpetrators, Confederacy. You understand the difference?  Goldberg said, referring to the Fox News host.  When you see something that is put together to intimidate  and that is celebrating a group of people who decided that they wanted to fight for their right to own slaves. I think it s kind of you can t it s beyond apples and oranges. Get a book, read a book, crack a book, read something. But Kilmeade wasn t about to take any of it lying down. Firing back on his radio show, The Brian Kilmeade Show, that afternoon, the Fox News host said he couldn t  wait to clarify something that they skewed. They are now putting a definer on the Jefferson Memorial in Washington DC. They are now defiling the Lincoln Memorial in Washington DC. They are chopping off heads of Columbus who I don t think fought in the Civil War but I gotta crack a book according to Whoopi Goldberg,  Kilmeade said. To put your values on people that lived 200 years ago, I think it shows the arrogance of our generation,  Kilmeade responded. What about all those people who thought it was perfectly okay for women not to vote?  Kilmeade asked.  What about all those people  that thought it was perfectly okay for blacks to go to the back of the bus? Are they all horrible people? They re brought up in a time where for some reason that was considered the norm. But as a society, we kept getting better. We always keep improving.

"WOW! HUNGARYS PRIME MINISTER Follows Through On Promise To Build Border Wall&George Soros Will Be Furious When He Sees The STUNNING Number of Illegal Immigrants Hes Kept Out So Far","Hungary has slashed illegal immigration by over 99 per cent after rolling out a series of powerful border fences in response to the European migrant crisis, possibly providing a lesson as to the potential impact of constructing President Trump s much-discussed southern wall in the U.S.A razor-wire fence built along Hungary s southern border with Serbia and Croatia has helped to sharply reduce the number of migrants from the hundreds of thousands who last year moved up from the Balkans towards northern Europe, especially Germany.Hungary says it has registered 19,140 asylum applications in 2016 and more than 14,000 migrants have crossed its southern borders illegally.Speaking on the second anniversary of the government s move to seal Hungary s border with Serbia   which is also an external border for the European Union   Prime Minister Viktor Orb n s Chief Security Advisor Gy rgy Bakondi announced that the fences have caused illegal immigration to collapse from 391,000 in 2015, to 18,236 in 2016, to just 1,184 in 2017.In February 2017, Prime Minister Orb n took his war against George Soros public:Hungary s populist prime minister on Friday lashed out against billionaire financier George Soros, claiming he and groups backed by him want to secretly influence the country s politics.In his annual state of the nation speech, Viktor Orban said groups partly funded by Soros, who was born in Hungary, needed to be made transparent and identifiable. Large-bodied predators are swimming here in the waters. This is the trans-border empire of George Soros, with tons of money and international heavy artillery,  said Orban, who received a Soros-funded scholarship as Hungary was transitioning from communism to democracy in the late 1980s. It is causing trouble   that they are trying secretly and with foreign money to influence Hungarian politics,  Orban said.Breitbart:  The system of technical barriers is the key to the success of border security, and without it, it would be impossible to stop the mass arrival of immigrants , the security chief explained.Hungary had to respond rapidly to the migrant influx which burst upon Europe after Germany s Angela Merkel announced there was  no limit  on the number of asylum seekers her own country would accept, so its frontiers are defended by twin fences peppered with watchtowers and patrolled by thousands of newly recruited border guards rather than a solid wall   which would have taken longer to construct.Nevertheless, as it has been steadily reinforced illegal migration has slowed to a trickle   drawing the ire of open borders activists like billionaire financier George Soros and globalist officials at the European Union and the United Nations.In June 2017, Orb n told the Hungarian parliament that his country  will not give in to blackmail from Brussels and we reject the mandatory relocation quota.  Schulz shot back swiftly at Orb n in his speech on Tuesday.His comments came as the European Commission voted to launch infringement proceedings against the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary for not taking in refugees under a mandatory 2015 quota system advocated by Germany that aimed to relocate 160,000 refugees across the Continent.Hungary s badass Prime Minister Viktor Orb n has consistently stood up to leftist EU bullies who are demanding that all EU nations take their  fair share  of the mass influx of mostly Muslim refugees. We shall not allow others to tell us whom we can let into our home and country, whom we can live alongside.    Prime Minister Viktor Orb nWatch Prime Minister Viktor Orb n s historic speech in March 2016, where he demands other European leaders find their backbone and save Europe before it s too late. His speech will make you want to stand up and cheer! Mr.Orb n says  That s a German problem,  Schulz said.  Let me make this perfectly clear: When it comes to agricultural policy, it s all  Yes, please.  When it comes to subsidies, it s all  Yes, please.  And when it comes to solidarity in refugee policy, it s  No, thank you    that s not acceptable. ",politics,"Sep 16, 2017"

"Trump Posed For Pic With Two Kids And Everyone Immediately Noticed One Shocking Thing In It","As one of the most approachable presidents in history, President Donald Trump didn t hesitate to partake in a picture when two kids approached and asked for a photo. He s seen smiling in between a brother and sister duo in the picture. As soon as the photo hit the Internet, everyone noticed one shocking thing in it.The photo looks like every other fan shot out there, with two beaming children who happened to get the opportunity to meet the president. However, it s now gone viral after viewers realized who the children were and why their paths had crossed with the president s.Elijah and Gianna Lucas live in Fresno, California but were in Washington, D.C. on Monday to attend a ceremony in honor of National Peace Officers  Memorial Day. Like thousands of others, they sat in the crowd and listened to our Commander-in-Chief speak about the importance of police work in America and the sacrifice it often is, which has gone without recognition for eight years under Barack Obama. Trump not only showed deep appreciation for the men and women in law enforcement but their families as well, many of whom are left to pick up the pieces after losing their hero in the line of duty.While Obama routinely recognized thugs shot by cops and incited riots around it, Trump does just the opposite in addressing the senseless loss of life by those who work to serve and protect everyone and mentions them by name. This means more to Elijah and Gianna than it does for most since these siblings are two of five in their family who are now growing up without their father, who died while on duty on October 31, 2016. President Trump holds Fresno County Sheriff s Sgt. Rod Lucas  sheriff s identification card as he poses with Lucas  children, Elijah and Gianna Lucas, at the Capitol in Washington, D.C.I don t recall Obama ever announcing his condolences when an officer of the law was killed, let alone take time to meet personally with their families and take a selfie with their children. He did this for thugs  moms seeking vengeance in their criminal child s death by cop but refused to give the same attention and respect where it really belongs   on the true victims.What s seen in this shot of the president with Fresno officer Sgt. Rod Lucas  kids is a genuine joy that the Trump had to be a part of this day for them, to personally tell them that their dad was a hero who is appreciated for his service. Lucas died an accidental death at the hands of one of his law enforcement colleagues on October 31, 2016. They were shifting guns around, talking about different ways to carry a second gun, when a gun was accidentally discharged, and a bullet struck Lucas in the chest,  Breitbart reports.  Investigators determined no foul play was involved. Rather, Lucas, a 20-year-veteran of the force, was  having a conversation with a nine-year veteran detective about the various ways to carry backup weapons when the shot was fired . In years past during Police Week, families and children of fallen officers didn t get the recognition they deserved from our president. Now that Trump is in office, he s more than making up for that lost time under Obama and ensuring children who woke up to bad news that their mom or dad wasn t coming home, feel that they aren t forgotten.In an incredible moment at the same event on Monday, held in front of the U.S. Capitol in D.C., Trump turned his speech to a 6-year-old boy named Micah, who he saw in the audience. Micah had lost his officer father in a shootout he was involved in while on the job in Phoenix, Arizona. Trump wanted to give him something special and personal and did so by tossing the boy his hat he had under the podium, which he was saving for himself to wear after the event until he found a far better use for it.Until Trump took office, the presidency was more concerned about disarming our officers and sympathizing with the families of thugs who died in the commission of a crime. Whenever a cop was killed, the past president wouldn t have even addressed it. However, that era officially ended on Monday when Trump posed for a selfie with two fatherless kids and tossed his hat to this little boy before saying,  I want you to know that patriotic Americans of all backgrounds truly support and love our police.

"PBS HOST ASKS HILLARY:Do You Believe The President Is Racist?&Her Answer Proves That She Is The REAL Racist [VIDEO]","PBS host Judy Woodroof asked Hillary if she believed President Trump is racist? Hillary pauses for effect and then delivers her very scripted answer to Woodruff:  Here s what I believe, I believe that he has given a lot of encouragement and rhetorical support to the Ku Klux Klan, he accepted the support of David Duke. Hillary knowingly pushed the lie that Trump accepted the support of KKK member David Duke. It s the same lie she s been peddling since Trump became her opponent in the presidential race, even though she knows there isn t one shred of evidence or proof to back up her sick claim. Her answer to Woodruff is nothing more than a lame attempt to pin Trump a false allegation on our sitting President while deflecting from the truth about her ACTUAL ties to the KKK. Watch Hillary attempt to paint President Trump as a  racist .When President Trump was dropping out of the Reform Party primary in 2000, he clearly condemned David Duke during an interview with Matt Lauer.When pressed by Matt Lauer on why he saw the Reform Party as self-destructing, Trump commented: Well, you ve got David Duke just joined, a bigot, a racist, a problem, I mean, this is not exactly the people you want in your party. Watch Trump s 2000 interview with Lauer here:What Hillary Clinton didn t mention to Judy Woodruff during her interview, was that her presidential campaign received more than $20,000 in donations contributed by members of the Ku Klux Klan. Vocativ reported that a prominent member of the hate group Will Quigg of the California Grand Dragon for the Loyal White Knights said,  For the KKK, Clinton is our choice . Mr. Quigg, the leader of the Klan s California chapter, announced last month that he had abandoned supporting Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump in lieu of backing his likely Democratic opponent. The Klansman claims that members have raised more than $20,000 for Mrs. Clinton and have donated it anonymously to her campaign.  She is friends with the Klan,  Mr. Quigg told Vocativ.  A lot of people don t realize that. Hillary never made any secret of her love and admiration for her  mentor,  the late Klan leader Democrat Senator, Robert Byrd.In a video uploaded to the State Department s official YouTube page on June 28, 2010, Clinton commemorated late Sen.

"Socialist Utopia of Venezuela Tells People to Eat Their Pets"," GENERALLY, VENEZUELANS DO NOT EAT RABBITS AND SEE THEM AS PETS The Venezuelan government just urged its citizens to eat their pet rabbits so they won t starve to death. A severe food crisis is part of the socialist utopia that just keeps going downhill. What s next? Cannibalism?President Nicolas Maduro unveiled a government program called  Plan Rabbit  at a meeting with his agriculture minister, Freddy Bernal, that was broadcast on Periscope, CNN Money reported. It s a plan to distribute rabbits to communities across Venezuela to breed and eat. Maduro noted that rabbits breed quickly and are a good source of protein, but not cholesterol.GOVERNMENT PUSHES A  CHANGE IN CONSUMPTION PATTERNS The rabbit isn t a pet, it s only two and a half kilos of meat,  Bernal stressed in the streamed announcement. He then invoked President Donald Trump to push the program. Trump s attack against the Venezuelan people is an opportunity to revise and change cultural consumption patterns,  he said.Venezuelan opposition leaders immediately slammed the move. Are you serious?  asked former presidential candidate Henrique Capriles in a video response.  You want people to start raising rabbits to solve the problem of hunger in our country? A 2016 study found that three-fourths of Venezuelans had lost almost twenty pounds on average over the course of the year. Meat is particularly scarce in the South American nation, with citizens even resorting to butchering zoo animals, according to police.Most economists agree the mass hunger is the result of socialist government policies spearheaded by former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez and Maduro, his successor. Chavez instituted price controls on many food items, which helped lead to shortages and massive inflation.We ve previously reported on shortages of food and even toilet paper in Venezuela.BYOTP! NO TOILET PAPER AND NO FOODSocialism doesn t work but I guess Venezuela didn t get the memo. No toilet paper? No food? Yes, it s come to that in this socialist hellhole Venezuela s product shortages have become so severe that some hotels in that country are asking guests to bring their own toilet paper and soap, a local tourism industry spokesman said on Wednesday .  It s an extreme situation,  says Xinia Camacho, owner of a 20-room boutique hotel in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada national park.  For over a year we haven t had toilet paper, soap, any kind of milk, coffee or sugar. So we have to tell our guests to come prepared.  Montilla says bigger hotels can circumvent product shortages by buying toilet paper and other basic supplies from black market smugglers who charge up to 6-times the regular price. But smaller, family-run hotels can t always afford to pay such steep prices, which means that sometimes they have to make do without.READ MORE: WFB ",politics,"Sep 16, 2017"
"U2 SUDDENLY CANCELS Huge St. Louis Concert Tonight&Why Bonos Decision To Cut and Run Makes Him Look Like Ridiculous Hypocrite","In 2016, celebrities came together to create an emotional video that minimized crimes committed or incidents that led to the death of black men and women, both young and old, across America. One of those celebrities was U2 s lead singer, Bono.For many, Bono s part in the video was even more controversial because he attempted to link the death of 9 black church members in South Carolina, who died while conducting a bible study at the hands of a young racist man, Dylann Roof, (who has since been sentenced to death for his heinous crime) with white cops who have killed blacks and have been found not guilty of intentional murder.The video doesn t just shine a light on injustices by white police officers, it promotes an atmosphere of hate and distrust for white people in America.It seems rather unusual that after U2 s Bono would cancel his concert in St. Louis that was scheduled for tonight, following a night of violent protests that led to the breaking of windows in the St. Louis Mayor s home (who supports BLM) and the shutting down of traffic for  safety  reasons.

Let that sink in The head of the city s largest police union is calling for the firing of a John Jay College professor after he tweeted  it s a privilege to teach future dead cops. Professor Michael Isaacson, a self-proclaimed member of the Antifa movement who works in the economics department at the CUNY Manhattan college, tweeted from the account @VulgarEconomics:  Some of ya ll might think it sucks being an anti-fascist teaching at John Jay College but I think it s a privilege to teach future dead cops  on Aug. 23.Patrolmen s Benevolent Association boss Pat Lynch wrote a letter saying Isaacson  harbors total disdain for the active and future police officers that he teaches at John Jay College. In a Friday letter to Karol Mason, president of John Jay College of Criminal Justice, Lynch demanded the  immediate dismissal  of Isaacson  on behalf of nearly 50,000 active and retired New York City police officers who are members of the Patrolmen s Benevolent Association of the City of New York. Recent media reports have revealed Mr. Isaacson s disgusting anti-police attitudes and his gleeful embrace of political violence, including violence against police officers, as expressed in his own social media postings,  Lynch wrote.Lynch continued:  It is absolutely outrageous that an individual who holds and expresses these views could be employed by any academic institution, much less one that counts an overwhelming number of New York City police officers as among its students, alumni and faculty members. He wrote that Isaacson s  continued presence will make it next to impossible for John Jay College to maintain any respect or credibility among the women and men who have dedicated their lives protecting this city, or among prospective students considering a law enforcement career.

"Like Mother, Like Daughter: Chelsea Clinton Spreads Lie Claiming Outrageous Michigan Anti-Gay Law Passed","Like mother, like daughter Brainiac Chelsea Clinton falsely tweeted today that the Michigan House had voted to allow emergency medical providers choice in treating patients, specifically giving EMTs the option to deny treatment to gay patients.Chelsea is often wrong on twitter. It s becoming embarrassing and evident that Steve Bannon was right about Hillary not being very smart. Looks like the apple doesn t fall far from the tree Absolutely appalling,  the former First Daughter tweeted,  Michigan House Passed Bill Allowing EMTs To Refuse Treatment To Gay People. The story Clinton cited was from a website for the LGBT New Now Next Awards, and was posted in 2014. When followers pointed out the story was old, Clinton deleted her tweet.Not only was the story old, but the actual premise was deeply flawed. What the Michigan House actually passed was a garden variety Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which would have exempted religious individuals from laws that infringed on their religious beliefs.Like most state RFRAs, the Michigan bill contained a clause that allows the state to infringe on religious beliefs when there s a  compelling government interest.  The preservation of human life is widely considered to qualify, according to legal experts.The misconception that the bill would allow ambulance drivers to let gay people bleed out in the streets evidently stems from a local CBS story, which was later picked up by CBS News  national website.Huh?  A Jewish butcher would not have to handle non-Kosher meat Yes, he REALLY said that: For example, a Christian doctor who does not believe in a gay lifestyle would not have to treat a gay patient,  CBS Detroit legal analyst Charlie Langton said at the time.  Or perhaps, a Jewish butcher would not have to handle non-Kosher meat. When the original CBS story was published, a Stanford law professor told the Weekly Standard that Langton was simply wrong.

The teacher tried to get the boy to stand for the Pledge of Allegiance but the boy says he doesn t do that.The teacher was put on leave and is under investigation now.A Black Publication is trying to spin this as just more racism after other black athletes refused to stand for the National Anthem. Notice how The Root spins this alleged assault: Everybody is all about freedom of speech and expression until a black person (hey, Colin Kaepernick; hey, Jemele Hill) decides to exercise his or her right to do so.

I was so confused. I didn t know what was going on. He says the homeroom teacher tried to force him to stand during the Pledge of Allegiance. I PLEDGE TO GOD AND FAMILY Click on Detroit reported: I don t stand because I don t pledge to a flag,  Stone said.  I pledge to God and family. The alleged incident happened Sept. 7. Stone said the next day, another teacher yelled at him for sitting down during the Pledge. I don t feel safe going to that school anymore because I don t know what they re going to do next,  Stone said.His father addressed the district directly during their last board meeting. It s his choice to sit,  Brian Chaney said.  I don t make him sit. And they should respect that. Marine veteran Stephen Stevens sees things differently. I would love to be able to talk to them and get their side and explain my side so maybe we could come to an understanding,  Stevens said.  Because I get they have that right, but I don t believe they understand what that right really entails. If they re fighting for freedom, they re fighting for us to have choices,  Brian Chaney said.  Then it s our choice. The superintendent of Farmington Public Schools released the following statement: The District fully supports the right of each student to participate or not in the daily Pledge. The teacher allegedly involved in the incident has been placed on administrative leave. At this time, the District cannot speculate about the outcome of the pending investigation. The family is exploring its options. Stone hasn t gone back to school, but they re probably going to leave the district.",politics,"Sep 15, 2017"

"NATIONAL PET CHAIN Linked To Outbreak of Bacterial Infection Sickens 39 People In 7 States, 9 Victims Have Already Been Hospitalized","The CDC is investigating an outbreak of a bacterial infection linked to puppies sold through the national pet store chain Petland.The outbreak of Campylobacter infections has sickened 39 people from seven states, including Florida, Kansas, Missouri, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Wisconsin.So far nine people have been hospitalized. No deaths have been reported.Campylobacter can cause a gastrointestinal illness in humans with symptoms of diarrhea, cramping, abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever. The illness typically lasts about a week and symptoms appear within two to five days after exposure. People more likely to get a severe infection include children younger than 5, adults older than 65, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems, including those with the genetic blood disorder thalassemia or HIV or people receiving chemotherapy.Investigators say evidence indicates that puppies sold through Petland stores are a likely source of this current outbreak. The bacteria can spread through contact with dog feces. It usually does not spread from one person to another.Twelve of those affected are Petland employees from four states. The other 27 people either recently purchased a puppy at Petland, visited a Petland store, or visited or live in a home with a puppy sold through Petland before illness began.The CDC says the pet store chain is cooperating with health officials to address the outbreak.

"Illegals Voting in Maryland City Elections Just the Tip of the Iceberg in Trend of Illegal Alien Voting?","We ve been reporting on this unbelievable trend in non-citizen (green card holders AND illegal aliens) voting across Maryland since August. The city of College Park,  Maryland is the latest to decide on non-citizen voting by a slim margin. Tucker Carlson is as outraged by this as we are:A city council in Maryland has voted in favor of allowing resident non-citizens such as illegal immigrants to participate in local elections. The charter amendment passed with its original wording with a vote of 4-3, with one abstention from District 1 Councilman Fazlul Kabir.The city council in College Park, home to the University of Maryland campus, has joined six other towns that allow green-card holders, illegal immigrants and other non-citizens to vote in local elections.In August, most of the residents voiced their opposition to the amendment letting all non-citizen residents to vote in local elections, but by Tuesday night, the majority wrote to the mayor in support of the proposal, Wojahn told the Post.The city hall meeting was packed and almost two-dozen people spoke against or for the motion expanding the voting privileges, Fox 5 DC reported. Local police were on hand due to previous threats and harassment over the motion.Both sides clashed verbally   with one man allegedly being called a Nazi while waiting to voice his opinion against the motion.The College Park City Council meeting is about to begin @thedbk pic.twitter.com/09ZVCwv3WA  Leah Brennan (@allhaeleah) September 12, 2017THIS IS SHOCKING! THE HISTORY OF ILLEGAL VOTING:The shocking thing is that Wikipedia says people who feel like they are citizens can vote Huh???The right of foreigners to vote in the United States has historically been a contentious issue. A foreigner, in this context, is an alien or a person who is not a citizen of the United States.Since 1996, a federal law has prohibited non-citizens from voting in federal elections, punishing them by fines, imprisonment, inadmissibility, and deportation. Exempt from punishment is any non-citizen who  reasonably believed at the time of voting that he or she was a citizen of the United States,  had a parent who is or was a citizen, and began permanently living in the United States before turning 16 years old. The federal law does not prohibit non-citizens from voting in state or local elections, but no state has allowed non-citizens to vote in state elections since Arkansas became the last state to outlaw non-citizen voting in 1926. 12 local governments, 11 of them in Maryland, allow non-citizens to vote in their local elections (Takoma Park, Barnesville, Martin s Additions, Somerset, Chevy Chase Sections 3 and 5, Glen Echo, Garrett Park, Hyattsville, College Park, and Mount Rainer). San Francisco allows noncitizens parents to vote in School Board elections (beginning in 2018).However, over 40 states or territories, including colonies before the Declaration of Independence, have at some time given at least some aliens voting rights in some or all elections. For example, in 1875, the Supreme Court in Minor v. Happersett noted that  citizenship has not in all cases been made a condition precedent to the enjoyment of the right of suffrage. Thus, in Missouri, persons of foreign birth, who have declared their intention to become citizens of the United States, may under certain circumstances vote. By 1900, nearly half of the states and territories had some experience with voting by aliens, and for some the experience lasted more than half a century. At the turn of the twentieth century, anti-immigration feeling ran very high, and Alabama stopped allowing aliens to vote by way of a constitutional change in 1901; Colorado followed suit in 1902, Wisconsin in 1908, and Oregon in 1914. Just as the nationalism unleashed by the War of 1812 helped to reverse the alien suffrage policies inherited from the late eighteenth century, World War I caused a sweeping retreat from the progressive alien suffrage policies of the late nineteenth century. In 1918, Kansas, Nebraska, and South Dakota all changed their constitutions to purge alien suffrage, and Texas ended the practice of non-citizen voting in primary elections by statute. Indiana and Texas joined the trend in 1921, followed by Mississippi in 1924 and, finally, Arkansas in 1926. In 1931, political scientist Leon Aylsworth noted:  For the first time in over a hundred years, a national election was held in 1928 in which no alien in any state had the right to cast a vote for a candidate for any office   national, state, or local.

During a concert in Grand Rapids, MI, Kid Rock took time to get very political, as he addressed some serious issues that he is clearly passionate about.Kid Rock started out by addressing his Grand Rapids, MI audience:  What s going on in the world today? It seems the government wants to give everyone health insurance but wants us all to pay. And to be very frank, I don t really don t have a problem with that, because God has blessed me, and made my pockets fat.  But redistribution of wealth seems more like their plan. And I don t believe that you should say sacrifice, do things by the book and then take care of some deadbeat, milking the system, lazy ass motherf -. Rock went on to address single moms who keep having kids to get more welfare. His most passionate statement was against deadbeat dads who refuse to be a  man  and raise their children.

"Ramadan Abdullah Set Free On Bail After Police Make Shocking Discovery Of Weapons In Storage Locker Destined For Secretive Islamic Compound In Upstate NY","How is a man with ties to a US based terror organization, who according to authorities, was caught planning to deliver a large cache of weapons to a secretive Islamic compound in upstate New York allowed to roam the streets while he awaits a trial that won t take place until  November? This incredible story should make every American wonder how serious we are about fighting homegrown terrorism in the United States A long-time associate of a U.S.-based Islamist terrorist organization, Muslims of America (MOA), was arrested in New York following the discovery of a large cache of weapons that were intended for MOA s  Islamberg  headquarters in Hancock, NY.Ramadan Abdullah, 64, was arrested in Johnson City, NY, and is no stranger to law enforcement. Abdullah was previously arrested along with another man in 1977 for attempting to rob a Brooklyn candy store, resulting in a murder.At the time, police searched Abdullah s home and discovered enough material to build 50 bombs. Even so, the charges against Abdullah were ultimately reduced.Abdullah was arrested on May 31 after attempting to steal four boxes of ammunition from a local Gander Mountain store. When asked by police about the purpose of the ammunition, Abdullah s answers raised suspicion among police who obtained a search warrant for a storage locker he was renting in the town of Union.During the search, the police discovered the following:8 assault weapons 4 loaded handguns 1 loaded shotgun 2 rifles 64 high-capacity ammunition feeding devices flak jacketsThousands of rounds of ammunition, including .50-caliber armor-piercing roundsPolice searched other residences linked to Abdullah and found a loaded handgun, and more high-capacity ammunition feeding devices and ammunition, including .38-caliber rounds.New York State Police Major Jim Barnes declined to confirm whether Abdullah was associated with terrorist groups or organizations but noted that police believe Abdullah had traveled overseas. There s no indications there was a plan in place to commit an act of violence. However, it begs the question, what was he doing with all this and what were his intentions down the road?  Barnes said.Johnson City Police Chief Brent Dodge said,  It s just a tremendous blessing to be able to take all these high power weapons and high power ammunition off the streets, and who knows what kind of large scale tragedy that this investigation may have prevented later down the road. Abdullah is a longtime associate of the U.S.-based Islamist cult Muslims of America.Apparently, a Muslim man with a large cache of weapons set to be delivered to a secretive Islamic compound in upstate New York, who also has a prior criminal record, doesn t pose enough of a security threat in the eyes of the judge, to keep him in jail until he is tried. The Johnson City man facing 16 charges in a massive weapons bust was granted release on bond Tuesday, as he awaits a Nov. 13 trial in Broome County Court.Ramadan Abdullah, 64, has pleaded not guilty to an indictment charging more than a dozen felonies connected to his arrest in June, which police described as being one of the area s largest gun takedowns in recent memory.Judge Kevin Dooley granted Abdullah s release from jail on bond Tuesday, after defense lawyer Matthew Ryan presented the court with two Binghamton properties that would be put up for collateral.(MOA), which has been described as a terrorist organization in documents from the FBI and other agencies. A 2003 file says MOA is linked to terrorists in Pakistan, including Al-Qaeda affiliates.The group s headquarters is a 70-acre compound in Hancock, NY called  Islamberg.  It is just a 50-minute drive from where Abdullah was arrested.Dennis Michael Lynch visited Islamberg to see what was really going on in the remote Islamic compound. Here is a clip from his visit:MOA is led by a radical cleric in Pakistan named Sheikh Mubarak Ali Gilani, who demands a cultish loyalty from his followers in America. Gilani indoctrinates them to follow a hate-filled extremist ideology that includes violent jihad against perceived enemies of Islam and a belief that they are fulfilling apocalyptic prophecies.The group has claimed to have 22  Islamic villages  across the U.S., mostly in rural areas, which have been used as guerilla training compounds. The group also has a history of committing acts of terrorism and crimes including murder, gun smuggling, narcotics trafficking and money laundering.A 2007 FBI report warns that MOA  possesses an infrastructure capable of planning and mounting terrorist campaigns overseas and within the U.S.  It says  members of the MOA are encouraged to travel to Pakistan to receive religious and military/terrorist training from [Sheikh] Gilani. Confidential sources inside MOA say that Ramadan Abdullah has been a significant member of the group since it first formed in the United States in 1980 and helped buy the land that became  Islamberg.  Additional research substantiates their information that he is close to MOA members.They say that he is an  elder  and often visits Islamberg to spend time with older members but does not live inside the commune. He s also provided firearms instruction for MOA, they report.The sources say that Abdullah s weapons were destined for the group, specifically Islamberg.Via: Clarion Project ",politics,"Sep 13, 2017"
"Hillary Clintons Voodoo Doll Obsession Revealed: Stick them full of pins","Hillary Clinton has a  thing  for voodoo her new book describes a voodoo moment but she s gone down this path before. Who does this? Hillary Clinton reveals she was  tempted  to make voodoo dolls of  certain members  of the news media and Congress, and then  stick them full of pins.  So Clinton wrote in her 494-page new memoir, What Happened, which was released today.In the book, Clinton complained that the  attacks  against her use of the private email server  were untrue or wildly overstated, and motivated by partisan politics. CLINTON SPOKE ABOUT HER VOODOO DOLL OBSESSION:It was a dumb mistake. But an even dumber  scandal.  It was like quicksand: the more you struggle, the deeper you sink. At times, I thought I must be going crazy. Other times, I was sure it was the world that had gone nuts. Sometimes I snapped at my staff. I was tempted to make voodoo dolls of certain members of the press and Congress and stick them full of pins. Mostly, I was furious at myself.VOODOO MOMENT #2!In her previous memoir, Hard Choices, Clinton described attending a voodoo spirit ceremony with a  voodoo priest  during her honeymoon with Bill Clinton in Haiti in 1975.SHE SPOKE ABOUT VOODOO IN HER MEMOIR  HARD CHOICES : One of the most memorable experiences of our trip was meeting a local voodoo priest named Max BeauvoirHe invited us to attend one of his ceremonies. We saw Haitians  seized with spirits  walk on hot coals, bite the heads off live chickens, and chew glass, spit out the shards, and not bleed. At the end of the ceremony, the people claimed the dark spirits had departed.BILL SPOKE ABOUT THE VISIT TOO:In his memoir  My Life,  the former president wrote a vivid account of a trip the couple s first trip to Haiti in 1975:A voodoo priest gave what Clinton described as a  brief course in voodoo theology.  And then the late-afternoon ceremony began. Clinton wrote: After several minutes of rhythmic dancing to pounding drums, the spirits arrived, seizing a woman and a man. The man proceeded to rub a burning torch all over his body and walk on hot coals without being burned. The woman, in a frenzy, screamed repeatedly, then grabbed a live chicken and bit its head off. Then the spirits left and those who had been possessed fell to the ground. Is this supposed to make the Clintons more relatable to the voodoo community? Haitians are probably sticking pins in Bill and Hillary voodoo dolls after the Clintons robbed them of funds raised after the earthquake in Haiti.Read more: Breitbart News ",politics,"Sep 13, 2017"

"WATCH: TOP 5 VIDEOS The Leftist Media Doesnt Want You to See Of KID ROCK Giving Back To Others","Organized protesters took to the streets outside of the brand new Little Caesars Arena in Detroit to protest Kid Rock s concert tonight, calling him a  racist  for using a confederate flag in his southern concerts years ago. The truth is that Kid Rock, who is a single father of a black son, and the recipient of the Detroit NAACP s great expectations award in acknowledgment of his work in helping the black community in Detroit, doesn t have a racist bone in his body. Liberal protesters are also pointing to Rock s public remarks expressing his disgust for Colin Kaepernick for disrespecting our flag by kneeling during our national anthem.  We all know the protests are being organized because the left fears Rock is serious about challenging the 2-term liberal US Senator Debbie ( rubber stamp ) Stabenow:Kid Rock has done more to help the city of Detroit than any elected official in recent history, yet people like Stephen Henderson, the race-obsessed editorial editor of the Detroit Free Press just can t help but criticize the rocker with a heart of gold and a passion for helping others who have either fallen on hard times or have bravely served our nation, by suggesting that Rock is a  racist. This is a musician who got rich off crass cultural appropriation of black music, who used to wrap his brand in the Confederate flag   a symbol inextricably linked to racism, no matter what its defenders say   and who has repeatedly issued profane denouncements of the very idea of African Americans pushing back against American inequality. Just last week, he trashed Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who s jobless right now because he dared challenge the nation s racism with a silent, kneeling protest during the pre-football game singing of the national anthem. Having Kid Rock open this arena is erecting a sturdy middle finger to Detroiters   nothing less. And the Ilitches, who ve done so much for this city and also taken so much from it, should be the last to embrace that kind of signaling.Sadly, it s people like Stephen Henderson who are so steeped in hate for anyone who doesn t buy into his nonsensical rhetoric, that will keep the hateful and divisive course Barack Obama set for our nation alive and well Here are just a few of many examples of how Kid Rock has given back to so many. These are videos you ll never see in the mainstream media. #1. 30-year old Dan Bawita is one of Kid Rock s biggest fans. As he sat at a table in a local restaurant in Michigan celebrating his birthday with friends and family, he got the surprise of his life when a very unexpected guest showed up to help him celebrate. Not only did Robert Ritchie, aka Kid Rock show up to surprise Dan, he spent over 2 hours hanging out with him and sharing a few pretty special gifts with his new friend.#2. In 2011, U.S. Army Sgt. Davin Dumar lost his left leg and suffered several other injuries during a deployment to Afghanistan. After 70 surgeries, Dan and his wife Dana wanted to move back to Michigan and settle down where they grew up. Kid Rock worked a local Michigan builder, Pulte Homes, and Operation Finally Home to build a home for the wounded vet and his wife. Watch Kid Rock, as he helps to surprise the couple with their new home:#3. Kid Rock didn t just visit the troops in Baghdad, he visited our troops while they were in a combat zone. A true American badass #4. In 2008, Kid Rock visited the troops in Al Asad, Iraq, for a Christmas concert. He started the concert by giving a speech thanking the troops for helping to protect our freedom of speech.    Watch him sing  All Summer Long  for the troops. ***Language warning***#5. In 2012, when the Detroit Symphony Orchestra was in danger of folding due to lack of funds, Kid Rock stepped up to the plate and performed a full-blown concert with the symphony to help raise money for the amazing group of musicians, who 5 years later, are still playing.***As a bonus (and because I also attended Romeo High School) we decided to include this video of Robert Ritchie surprising the high school he attended with a $5K gift to be used to help boost their arts program.",politics,"Sep 12, 2017"

"TRUMPS DOJ CHOOSES SIDES In Supreme Court Case Of Baker Who Refused To Make Cake For Gay Wedding","The double standard in our judicial system today, as it relates to the protection of religious rights for Christians in America is stunning. Activist judges have been legislating from the bench for far too long when it comes to the protection of religious rights. Will President Trump s DOJ put an end to the persecution of Christians with this very important upcoming case?  In a major upcoming Supreme Court case that weighs equal rights with religious liberty, the Trump administration on Thursday sided with a Colorado baker who refused to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex couple.The Department of Justice on Thursday filed a brief on behalf of baker Jack Phillips, who was found to have violated the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act by refusing to created a cake to celebrate the marriage of Charlie Craig and David Mullins in 2012. Phillips said he doesn t create wedding cakes for same-sex couples because it would violate his religious beliefs.The government agreed with Phillips that his cakes are a form of expression, and he cannot be compelled to use his talents for something in which he does not believe. Forcing Phillips to create expression for and participate in a ceremony that violates his sincerely held religious beliefs invades his First Amendment rights,  Acting Solicitor General Jeffrey B. Wall wrote in the brief.  WaPoComedian Steven Crowder made a powerful (and hilarious) video that was seen by over 5 MILLION viewers, exposing how the left twists the narrative to promote their radical ideology. Crowder went undercover to several Muslim bakeries in Dearborn, Michigan to see how many of them would be willing to bake a cake for a gay couple. Keep in mind, the left is the champion of Muslim communities in America when it comes to protecting their rights.Watch:In 2015, Star Transport lost a high profile case after two Muslim Somali immigrant drivers who worked for them were fired for refusing to deliver alcohol, as part of their job.

"Democrats Caught in Major Lie About DREAMERS [Video]","Democrats have been spouting the narrative that DACA recipients are overwhelmingly serving in the military. That s a lie! Fewer than 900 DACA recipients out of 800,000 are serving in the armed forces. The Democrats have been lying about who makes up DACA but this is a HUGE glaring lie.Breitbart News reports that fraud is rampant for DACA:Fraud is rampant and  huge  for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, a former official with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) agency alleges. Under DACA, nearly 800,000 illegal aliens were given temporary protected status and work permits to remain in the United States. Experts have told Breitbart Texas that during the Obama Administration, background screening was lax.In an interview with LifeZette, former USCIS manager of the agency s investigative unit, Matt O Brien, alleged that the fraud rate for DACA is roughly  40 to 50 percent  and potentially even  higher : Based on what I had seen and what I discussed with my colleagues, the fraud rate is 40 to 50 percent. It s possible that it was higher,  he told LifeZette this week.IN CASE YOU WANT MORE INFO ON DACA: WATCH AG Jeff Sessions Explain Why Obama s Unconstitutional Act Has Harmed Americans US Attorney General Jeff Sessions brilliantly lays out the case for America and against those who believe it s okay to break our laws, as long as you have lawmakers who are willing to look the other way The Department of Homeland Security will stop processing any new applications for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) program. I am here today to announce that the program known as DACA that was effectuated under the Obama administration is being rescinded,  Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Tuesday at a Justice Department news conference.Sessions was critical of the Obama program implemented through executive order in 2012 to give work authorization and government benefits, like Social Security to nearly a million illegal aliens.  MRCTV Watch: The brilliant Jessica Vaughan, from the Center for Immigration Studies, shared these important facts about DACA recipients in America, compiled by Harvard University researcher Roberto G. Gonzales, called the National UnDACAmented Research Project. There are important (self-acknowledged) caveats to the findings: The research is based on an online survey of just over 2,000 self-described DACA-eligible respondents and about 200 follow-up interviews. Gonzales believes that for a variety of reasons, the respondents are more educated and well-off than the DACA population as a whole.Nevertheless, the findings are interesting. Here is a sample:73 percent of DACA recipients he surveyed live in a low-income household (defined as qualifying for free lunch in high school); 22 percent have earned a degree from a four-year college or university; 21 percent have dropped out of high school; 20 percent have no education beyond high school and no plans to attend college; 59 percent obtained a new job with a DACA work permit, but only 45 percent increased their overall earnings; 36 percent have a parent who holds a bachelor s degree; and 51 percent were already employed before DACA. None of this is to suggest that these individuals should not be considered for an amnesty or legalization program, but to suggest that the arguments in favor of such a program are largely political rather than economic. Immigrants who are not highly educated and who are working in low-paying jobs are more likely to access welfare and other public assistance programs over the course of their lives.

"Is Conservative Firebrand Laura Ingraham Joining Fox News?","Will radio host and television commentator Laura Ingraham become a prime time host at Fox News? The word is that Ingraham will be taking the ten o clock spot.The rumor started when Matt Drudge of The Drudge Report hinted that Ingraham had a spot on Fox lined up.Ingraham has been telling friends that the deal is essentially done, with just a few details to iron out, CNN reports.Ingraham s taking over of ten o clock is part of a larger restructuring of Fox s lineup. Sean Hannity s show will move from its current ten o clock slot to nine p.m. And  The Five  will move back to five p.m. from its current nine o clock time.This shift was almost certainly prompted by the firing of Eric Bolling and concurrent cancelling of Bolling s panel show,  The Specialists,  which previously filled the five o clock slot. Bolling had been under internal investigation following accusations of sexual misconduct on his part, claims which Bolling fervently denies.Bolling s sudden exit is part of a larger shake-up at Fox prompted by allegations of sexual misconduct. Fox Chairman and CEO Roger Ailes left in July 2016, while Bill O Reilly left in April after 21 years at the network, both for similar reasons.It is not known when the show will begin airing, but CNN s sources say that the deal has been confirmed. A Fox News spokeswoman denied the existence of the deal to CNN.We certainly hope this is a done deal. Ingraham gets the Trump voter and isn t in the DC bubble.

"DONALD TRUMP JR., JUST HUMILIATED Michael Moore In Front Of Millions On Social Media&And It Was SPECTACULAR!","Leftist activist and mediocre filmmaker Michael Moore made a very lame attempt at shaming President Donald Trump on Friday. Moore feigned concern on Twitter that Trump s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, FL wasn t being used as a shelter. Moore tweeted on Friday,  Has he [President Trump] opened up Mar-a-Lago as a shelter yet? , suggesting that President Trump should have opened the doors to his public club to help those looking for shelter from Hurricane Irma that was set to pound the southern and eastern shores of Florida.Has he opened up Mar-a-Lago as a shelter yet?

The more you hate on Donald Trump and his family, the more voters the Democrat Party will lose in 2018 and beyond As a side note, Trump ruffled a lot of feathers in the exclusive enclave of Palm Beach, FL when he opened the doors to Mar-a-Lago to both Blacks and Jews, when other private clubs in the area were excluding them.

"Empty Barrels Make the Most Noise  General John Kelly Just Ripped Democrat Who Said Hes a Disgrace to the Uniform","Fox News received an email from General John Kelly last night in response to a personal shot taken at him by a member of Congress This is not just any member of Congress it s the bitter open borders Democrat Luis Gutierrez. This Chicago Democrat is all for opening the flood gates for illegals Last week, you may remember that Democrat Luis Gutierrez, in slamming President Trump s decision on DACA, went after Kelly in particular and said the following:General Kelly, when he was the head of Homeland Security, lied straight to the faces of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus about preventing the mass deportation of DREAMers. Now as Chief of Staff, this former general is executing the plan to take away their lifeline and taking steps to criminalize young people who live and work here legally. General Kelly is a hypocrite who is a disgrace to the uniform he used to wear. He has no honor and should be drummed out of the White House along with the white supremacists and those enabling the President s actions by  just following orders. Gutierrez received a lot of criticism but Gutierrez is standing by his criticism. He told The Washington Examiner last week,  He s a politician. He works for Donald Trump and now supports Donald Trump s xenophobic, racist policies, and he s carrying them out as his chief of staff. I m not talking about him as a general; I m talking about him as a politician. What Gutierrez forgets is that Obama in 2012 said this about DACA: Now, let s be clear   this is not amnesty, this is not immunity. This is not a path to citizenship. It s not a permanent fix. This is a temporary stopgap measure   Congress needs to act. There is still time for Congress to pass the DREAM Act this year, because these kids deserve to plan their lives in more than two-year increments. GENERAL KELLY STRIKES BACK:Fox News reports today that Kelly reacted to Gutierrez s remarks thusly:In an email to Fox News late Sunday, Kelly responded by saying Congress did  nothing  to help so-called Dreamers when they had the chance. As far as the congressman and other irresponsible members of congress are concerned, they have the luxury of saying what they want as they do nothing and have almost no responsibility,  Kelly said.  They can call people liars but it would be inappropriate for me to say the same thing back at them. As my blessed mother used to say  empty barrels make the most noise. He concluded,  The congressman has a right to his opinion. Kelly also said in the letter,  Every DOJ and DHS lawyer says DACA is unconstitutional. Every other legal scholar   right and left   says the same thing. Trump didn t end DACA, the law did. That said, I worked and succeeded to give the congress another six months to do something. I am not confident. Read more: FOX News ",politics,"Sep 11, 2017"
"WOW! POPE FRANCES Tells Journalists That People Who Dont Believe In Man-Made Climate Change Are Stupid and Stubborn","Here is a portion of the interview that was conducted by a group of journalists and Pope Frances today:Vatican Insider    I leaned out to greet the children and didn t see the glass, and  pum! The Pope with a smile and an obvious dark bruise framing his left cheek, answers the question on how he feels after the small accident that happened to him in Cartagena. Immediately after the Avianca flight took off from Cartagena, Francis spoke for 38 minutes with journalists on immigration, climate change, Trump s latest measures and the situation in Venezuela. He confirmed that he had a private meeting with the Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni, but denied that there was talk of immigration. He expressed his support to Italy for what the country is doing by trying to manage the emergency landings and regulate immigration flows. Here is a list of US Senators who are also Catholics. Their pro-life ratings are listed in front of their names.: Senate100% Mike Johanns, R-Neb.100% Jim Risch, R-Idaho100% David Vitter, R-La.94% Pat Toomey, R-Pa.**68% Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska50% Robert Casey Jr., D-Pa.31% Mary Landrieu, D-La.23% Susan Collins, R-Maine11% Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.4% John Kerry, D-Mass.2% Richard Durbin, D-Ill.2% Tom Harkin, D-Iowa2% Barbara Mikulski, D-Md.2% Patty Murray, D-Wash.2% Jack Reed, D-R.I.1% Robert Menendez, D-N.J.0% Mark Begich, D-Alaska0% Maria Cantwell, D-Wash.0% Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y.0% Claire McCaskill, D-Mo.Does anyone see a pattern here? Yet, no open condemnation for these lawmakers who actually have the power to stop the barbaric practice of abortion by the Pope. Italy is starting to feel the climate change. There have been many deaths in recent days and so much damage  Why is it that governments are delaying this realization, whereas on other issues they keep soliciting, like on the Korean arms race, for example?How ironic that the Pope would suggest climate-change deniers who ve been screaming that phony climate change data and peddlers are part of a scheme to extort money from citizens that will somehow  fix  the NOT resolved science behind  man-made climate change. I have heard of the abolition of this law, but I have not been able to read the articles on how and why this decision was taken. I do not know the situation well. However, detaching young people from their family won t bear any good fruit for young people or the family. This law comes from the executive and not from Parliament: if that is the case, I hope that they will think it over again a little bit. I have heard the President of the United States speak, who presents himself as a pro-life. If he is a good pro-life, he understands the importance of family and life: the unity of the family must be defended. When young people feel exploited, they ultimately feel hopeless. And who steals it? Drugs, other kinds of addictions, suicide  achievable when your roots are cut off. Anything that goes against the roots steals hope. ",politics,"Sep 11, 2017"

Mitt Romney is preparing to run for Senate in 2018 if Sen. Orrin Hatch decides to retire.Sources close to Romney say the two-time presidential candidate will jump into the 2018 Utah Senate scrum if Hatch opts not to.So far, Hatch has not made up his mind as to whether he ll run for an eighth term in 2018. He has previously said he was planning on running as long as his and his wife s health holds up.Dave Hansen, a longtime political advisor to Hatch, told UtahPolicy.com last month that he didn t expect Hatch to decide on his political future until October. However, sources now tell UtahPolicy.com that Hatch may not make up his mind until December.Hatch s reticence to make a definitive announcement is presenting other candidates from getting in the race, but Romney has the financial resources to mount a campaign no matter when Hatch decides.A UtahPolicy.com poll shows Romney would be in great shape to win a Senate race against Democrat Jenny Wilson. Romney pulls 64% of the vote to Wilson s 26%. The poll shows Stewart would only be ahead of Wilson 34-30, but that s likely due to Stewart being less familiar to Utah voters.Earlier this year Hatch said he would be willing to step aside if an  outstanding person  like Mitt Romney were to run for the seat he currently holds.

DeVos ignited a firestorm when she announced the end of yet another case of an unlawful overreach by Barack Obama, that affected every college student by stripping them of their right to due process in sexual assault cases.DeVos explained her reasoning for reversing an unfair and impractical solution to sexual assault on campuses:  Survivors, victims of a lack of due process, and campus administrators, have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved. A student says he or she was sexually assaulted by another student on campus. If he or she isn t urged to keep quiet, or discouraged from reporting it to local law enforcement, the case goes to a school administrator, who will act as the judge and jury. The accused may or may not be told of the allegations before a decision is rendered. If there is a hearing, both the survivor and the accused, may or may not be allowed legal representation. Whatever evidence is presented may or may not be shown to all parties. The notion that a school must diminish due process rights to better serve the victim only creates more victims. A better way also means we shouldn t demand anyone become something they are not.Click HERE for video of Betsy DeVos making her announcement that has the Ivy League educated attorney so angry.Ranco brags about his huge settlement against the Austin Police Department in 2016, for excessive use of force against an innocent citizen.

Ryan was proposing an 18-month suspension of the debt ceiling that would have let the government keep borrowing as much as it needed, and said the long time frame was needed to provide for market stability.But Democrats said they could only agree to a three-month suspension since they wanted leverage more immediately for other issues they want to pursue in the coming weeks. Trump s decision to take the Democratic plan was seen by some as a betrayal of Republicans, and a sign Trump was abandoning the GOP on a key legislative package.After the dust settled, however, Republican lawmakers and aides made it clear they saw the three-month plan as a slight improvement over Ryan s plan.The reason was simple.Neither plan involved a commitment to new spending cuts as a condition for allowing more government borrowing, something many conservatives wanted to see. With that key piece lacking, many Republicans preferred a shorter term agreement for the same reason Democrats did: it will let them try much sooner to leverage the next debt ceiling fight for their own policy prescription, in this case, spending cuts.A source with the conservative House Freedom Caucus said that group has not met to discuss the plan that Trump settled on Wednesday. But this source said many members of the group seem to agree that both deals were bad because neither included a commitment to spending cuts. Lots of members think the three-month deal is bad, but so is an 18-month deal,  this source said. But the source added that the shorter time frame will at least let them try again soon, and in that way, is better for Republicans. [HFC] members don t want to sit on their hands,  the source said.HFC members, in particular, see the debt ceiling deadline as a chance to threaten not to vote for an increase in the borrowing limit until spending cuts are included. When the battle heats up again, the HFC is expected to push for a cap on federal spending based on a percentage of U.S. gross domestic product.The HFC is a relatively small group of conservative lawmakers known for clashing with House GOP leaders. The Republican Study Committee, in contrast, is more mainstream and is comprised of most House GOP lawmakers for the purpose of advancing conservative policies.But even the RSC indicated Wednesday that Trump s deal is better for Republicans than what Ryan was pushing. For example, RSC member Tom Cole, R-Okla., said Wednesday that he preferred Trump s plan over Ryan s. I think a short-term deal is much easier to vote for than an 18-month or two-year extension with no offsets,  he said on MSNBC, describing the choices that were put before the GOP. Cole cast the deal Trump reached as a slight delay that will let Republicans try again soon for spending cuts. I think a much worse deal would have been to extend the debt ceiling with no spending cuts,  he added.  So we live to fight another day. For entire story: Washington Examiner ",politics,"Sep 8, 2017"

"NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTER FRAUD BOMBSHELL: New Report Reveals How Over 5,500 Votes Were Illegally Cast On Election Day 2016"," Kris Kobach   For years, the mainstream media has ignored the problem of voter fraud and belittled those of us who are trying to do something about it. And when secretaries of state like me identify cases of fraud, we are told that the number of incidents of voter fraud is too insignificant to matter.New Hampshire was a must win for Hillary. Watch CNN explain the significance of winning the state of New Hampshire for Hillary: New Hampshire is one of fifteen states that allow same-day voter registration. The benefit of same-day registration is that it allows a person who has procrastinated or has forgotten to register to nonetheless cast a ballot on election day. The downside of same-day registration is that it does not allow the state time to assess the eligibility of the voter. A volunteer poll worker simply accepts a modicum of identification and takes the voter at his word that he s a U.S. citizen resident of the state who is eligible to vote.New Hampshire is also a battleground state. Unlike neighboring Massachusetts and Vermont, which reliably vote for the Democrat in presidential elections, New Hampshire can swing either way. It has long been reported, anecdotally, that out-of-staters take advantage of New Hampshire s same-day registration and head to the Granite State to cast fraudulent votes.Now there s proof.According to statistics released by the Speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, on the date of the general election in November 2016, there were 6,540 same-day registrants who registered to vote in New Hampshire using an out-of-state driver s license to prove their identity. In and of itself, that doesn t prove that any fraud occurred   theoretically, each of those individuals could have been someone who recently moved to the State and had not yet had time to get a New Hampshire driver s license. According to New Hampshire law, a new resident has 60 days to obtain a New Hampshire driver s license.So if those 6,540 voters were bona fide New Hampshire residents, they would get their driver s license no later than January 7, 2017. However, the numbers tell a very different story. It turns out that, as of August 30, 2017   nearly ten months after the election   only 1,014 of the 6,540 same-day registrants who registered with an out-of-state license had obtained a New Hampshire driver s license. The other 5,526 individuals never obtained a New Hampshire driver s license. And, of those 5,526, only 213 registered a vehicle in New Hampshire.So 5,313 of those voters neither obtained a New Hampshire driver s license nor registered a vehicle in New Hampshire. They have not followed the legal requirements for residents regarding driver s licenses, and it appears that they are not actually residing in New Hampshire. It seems that they never were bona fide residents of the State.5,513 is a big number   more than enough to swing two very important elections. The closest major election was the contest between incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Kelly Ayotte and challenger Maggie Hassan (D). Hassan won the election by a razor-thin margin of 1,017 votes. Those 5,313 fraudulent votes were more than enough to swing the election. If 59.2 percent or more of them went for Hassan, then the election was stolen through voter fraud. That s likely, since the surrounding states are Democrat strongholds.It s also possible that New Hampshire s four electoral college votes were swung to Hillary Clinton through illegal voting by nonresidents. Clinton won New Hampshire by only 2,732 votes. If 74.8 percent of the 5,513 fraudulent votes were cast for Clinton, then the presidential election in New Hampshire was tipped as well.If the presidential contest had been closer and had come down to a margin of three or four electoral college votes, then this voter fraud might have had extraordinary consequences. Regardless, in the Senate contest, it is highly likely that voting by nonresidents changed the result.   Breitbart ",politics,"Sep 7, 2017"

"BOOM! LIBS GO NUTS After BETSY DEVOS Announces Due Process Barack Obama Stripped From College Students In Sexual Assault Cases Will Be Restored [VIDEO]","President Trump s Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos spoke today at George Mason University s Virginia campus. DeVos ignited a firestorm when she announced the end of yet another case of an unlawful overreach by Barack Obama, that affected every college student by stripping them of their right to due process in sexual assault cases.DeVos explained her reasoning for reversing an unfair and impractical solution to sexual assault on campuses:  Survivors, victims of a lack of due process, and campus administrators, have all told me that the current approach does a disservice to everyone involved. A student says he or she was sexually assaulted by another student on campus. If he or she isn t urged to keep quiet, or discouraged from reporting it to local law enforcement, the case goes to a school administrator, who will act as the judge and jury. The accused may or may not be told of the allegations before a decision is rendered. If there is a hearing, both the survivor and the accused, may or may not be allowed legal representation. Whatever evidence is presented may or may not be shown to all parties. The notion that a school must diminish due process rights to better serve the victim only creates more victims. A better way also means we shouldn t demand anyone become something they are not.Students, families, school administrators are generally not lawyers, and they re not judges. We shouldn t force them to be so for justice to be served.The era of rule by letter is over. Through intimidation and coercion, the failed system has clearly pushed schools to overreach. With the heavy hand of Washington tipping the balance of her scale, the sad reality is that Lady Justice is not blind on campuses today. Watch:Liberals immediately attempted to twist the facts in this decision to uphold the law by allowing every American the right to due process, into  Trump adminstration supports rape on college campuses.  Liberals are so used to a president and an administration who flagrantly disregards the law, they can t even comprehend why due process is one of our most sacred rights.Twitter user, Makada does a great job of explaining to the leftsits who are criticizing DeVos and Presdient Trump that men should be entitled to the same rights as women, and that it is NOT okay to determine that they are guilty of sexual assault without a fair trial in a court of law:Leftists are tweeting #StopBetsy because she wants men to be innocent until proven guilty.

Trump went around Ryan and McConnell to make a deal to get funds to the hurricane victims in Texas.

The art of the deal in action Trump also pushes the issue on the debt limit to right before the election in 3 months brilliant! SHOCKING  PIVOT BY POTUS:He turned on Republican leaders in Congress when he caved to Democrats  demands to raise the debt limit and fund the government for three months, setting up a brutal year-end fiscal cliff. The move shocked everyone, as top White House officials and GOP leaders had been gearing up to raise the debt ceiling through the 2018 midterm election, looking to pass legislation as soon as Friday.But even after Mnuchin, Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell pushed back on the Democratic demands in the meeting, Trump agreed to the three-month deal that will also head off the possibility of a government shutdown until mid-December.During the meeting, Ryan sharply criticized the Democratic proposal, a source familiar with the exchange said. But Schumer reminded him that Ryan had supported short-term increases in the past intended to help create bipartisan deals in 2013.So after Democrats rejected GOP proposals to raise the debt ceiling for 18 months, and then six months   Trump endorsed Schumer s three-month pitch.The Treasury Department will likely be able to buy more time for Congress on the debt limit into 2018.

She got really nasty during a confirmation hearing for  Barrett: When you read your speeches, the conclusion one draws is that the dogma lives loudly within you, and that s of concern when you come to big issues that large numbers of people have fought for, for years in this country. Barrett had already stated at the beginning of the hearing that it is  never appropriate for a judge to apply their personal convictions, whether it derives from faith or personal conviction. IS THERE A TREND TO BLOCK TRUMP NOMINEES BY TARGETING THEIR RELIGION?This line of questioning is disturbing and isn t the first time recently that a Senator has berated a nominee for his religion:In June, Bernie Sanders got really nasty and snarky with nominee Russell Vought.  Voight was President Trump s nominee for deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget. Just like Barrett, Voight had written about his Christian faith and was drilled by a relentless Sanders:BERNIE SANDERS decided to go after the religion of a nominee for Deputy Director of the Office of Management and Budget This was a vicious attack on RUSSELL VOUGHT who has strong Christian beliefs that have absolutely nothing to do with what he was being questioned about. Religious beliefs aren t budgetary concerns. This was a personal attack on a DEVOUTLY RELIGIOUS man who had written an article years past defending his Christian College.PART OF THE EXCHANGE BETWEEN SANDERS AND VOUGHT:Sanders is quoting from an article that Vought wrote:  Muslims do not simply have a deficient theology. They do not know God because they have rejected Jesus Christ, His Son, and they stand condemned.  Do you believe that that statement is Islamophobic?Vought: Absolutely not, Senator. I m a Christian, and I believe in a Christian set of principles based on my faith.Sanders: Forgive me, we just don t have a lot of time. Do you believe people in the Muslim religion stand condemned? Is that your view?Vought: Again, Senator, I m a Christian, and I wrote that piece in accordance with the statement of faith at Wheaton College.Sanders: I understand that. I don t know how many Muslims there are in America. Maybe a couple million. Are you suggesting that these people stand condemned? What about Jews? Do they stand condemned too?Vought: Senator, I m a Christian.Sanders: I understand you are a Christian, but this country [is] made of people who are not just I understand that Christianity is the majority religion, but there are other people of different religions in this country and around the world. In your judgment, do you think that people who are not Christians are going to be condemned?Vought: Thank you for probing on that question. As a Christian, I believe that all individuals are made in the image of God and are worthy of dignity and respect regardless of their religious beliefs. I believe that as a Christian that s how I should treat all individuals.Sanders: Do you think that s respectful of other religions?I would simply say, Mr. Chairman, that this nominee is really not someone who this country is supposed to be about. I will vote  no. CAN THE US GOVERNMENT IMPOSE RELIGIOUS TESTS FOR PUBLIC OFFICE:The Constitution says the U.S. government can t impose religious tests for public office. But scholars say Sen. Bernie Sanders can without consequence apply his own religious rubric in opposing a presidential nominee who believes non-Christians risk going to hell.The Vermont independent, who is Jewish but  not particularly religious,  grilled Russell Vought, nominee to be deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, on Wednesday, focusing on an article he wrote that said Muslims  do not know God because they have rejected Jesus Christ his Son, and they stand condemned. Sanders asked if that view was Islamophobic, and if Jews also stand condemned.Vought responded that he is a Christian.  In your judgment, do you think that people who are not Christians are going to be condemned?  Sanders asked. Vought began to answer before Sanders interrupted, asking if that viewpoint was  respectful of other religions. National Review columnist David French writes that Sanders was  imposing a religious test for public office in direct violation of Article VI of the United States Constitution  and that he was objecting to  entirely orthodox Christian beliefs  about access to heaven.Constitutional scholars say Sanders, who said he will vote against Vought, may violate the spirit of the Constitution, but arguably not Article VI, which states:  no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States. No senator should vote against a nominee based on his or her religion. It would violate the spirit if not the letter of the Constitution. But senators can vote against nominees for any reason or no reason at all. There would be no legal consequence, and the nominee would have no forum for complaint. Allan Vestal of Drake University Law School says the Constitution s religious-test ban  does not provide a mechanism for inquiring into the motivations of individual senators and representatives in the votes they cast. There is no constitutional constraint on yea or nay votes, so yes he can do it,  agrees Richard Epstein, a New York University law professor.So now Trump nominees will all be attacked for their religion? This is really dangerous territory.Read more: US News",politics,"Sep 6, 2017"

The video featured stark images of the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, along with graffiti supporting the movement for Black Lives Matter, a police cruiser sinking into a body of water and a young black boy dancing in front of a line of officers outfitted in riot gear. That s all before Beyonc  throws up her middle fingers.In other words There can be no denying that Michelle has given up the front, and is coming out as a full-fledged supporter of the anti-law enforcement Black Lives Matter domestic terror group.The Washington Post wrapped up their piece by reminding their readers how painful it s been for Michelle to be stuck in the White House, and how she s looking forward to living a  normal  life again, unlike the  stodgy  former first ladies before her:In one of her final interviews as first lady, Obama told Oprah Winfrey that she longed for a  normal  life after living in the nation s fish bowl. So it seems counter intuitive for her to participate in this such a public display of adulation for one of the world s most famous women.Add to that the controversial nature of the look   which hearkens to Beyonc  in one of her more militant moments. Remember that satirical New Yorker cover, which cast Michelle Obama as a fist-bumping, combat boot-wearing, afro d commando? That image, Obama has said,  knocked [her] back. ",politics,"Sep 6, 2017"
"VANITY FAIR LEAVES MELANIA Off BEST DRESSED List&But Look Who Did Make The List","Immediately following the election, a few leftist designers announced they wouldn t work with Melania Trump. Their decision to not offer their fashion creations to Melania hasn t seemed to have had much of an effect on her. Melania has brought elegance, class and most of all, style back to the White House that we haven t seen since the Jackie Kennedy era.Apparently, Vanity Fair missed the excitement and enthusiasm so many women (and men) seem to have for seeing photos of the always meticulously dressed First Lady Melania Trump, because somehow, her name was kept off their  Best Dressed Women of 2017  list, but several names that appeared on their list have many Americans scratching their heads in disbelief.Melania made her first major fashion statement on the day her husband was inaugurated as our 45th President, where she was seen wearing a stunning two-piece, robin s egg blue, Ralph Lauren suit.Later in the evening, Melania stunned again in a sleek white, off-the-shoulder column dress with a modest slit revealing her toned legs, as she and President Trump danced to Frank Sinatra s  My Way. There have been countless photos of Melania carrying herself with grace, class, and elegance as truly one of the most well-dressed First Lady s in history.Melania stunned the world in her luxurious black pants suit on her first overseas trip to Saudi Arabia with President Trump:Again, Melania pulled off another amazing pants suit on her trip to Saudi Arabia, that even made some of us forget about the damage Hillary Clinton had done to the image of pants suits on women.But Vanity Fair s list apparently is less a list of  well dressed  individuals and couples, and more a list of individuals who lean left. Here are a few of the people who did make Vanity Fair s list:Here are a few of the people who did make Vanity Fair s  Best Dressed Women  list:Beyonce s sister, (Yes, the same sister who was caught on camera beating and kicking Jay Z in an elevator.) Solange Knowles made the list.  Because why?We don t need to go into the whole love-fest between Solange s much more famous sister Beyonce and the Obama s, do we?And the entertainer Rhianna, who usually looks like she just walked out a freak show, and calls women up to the stage while she s performing to grind on them in front of a packed house, was also named as one of Vanity Fair s  Best Dressed . Did we mention that she was a huge Obama supporter? When she visited the White House, she told her fans that the best part of the visit was that Obama was  black . She probably just forgot that he is also white. Anyhow, it s probably pretty clear why Vanity Fair chose her.Vanity Fair even had a  Best Dressed Couples  category, and to the surprise of no one, the Obama s and the Macron s made the list that should have been renamed the  High Profile People On The Left Who Wear Clothes . Of course, Michelle and Barack made the list. Even funnier, is the fact that Vanity Fair chose this photo to highlight Michelle s great taste in clothing.And then there s the leftist first couple of France, the Macron s. We must concede, that Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron are the only leftists on this list that we believe actually have any business being on a  Best Dressed  list. Like Melania Trump, France s first lady never disappoints when it comes to fashion. Vanity Fair did however mention Melania and her fashion sense in arecent article, but it was anything but flattering, as they attempted to accuse her of copying (of all people) Michelle Obama, as a way to make her more appealing to Americans. LOL!From the Vanity Fair article:Melania Trump appears to be taking a page out of the Michelle Obama book of fashion. The usually designer-clad Trump flew from Camp David to D.C. over the weekend wearing a surprisingly affordable $75 pink gingham shirt from J.Crew along with a pair of matching J Brand pink pants and Manolo Blahnik flats. According to Yahoo Style Canada, the button-up top is a discontinued piece from the brand s 2012 collection. Perhaps she s been waiting to save the economical top for just the right moment in her First Lady reign.The mall brand is a major departure from the First Lady s typical designer wardrobe, which is occasionally criticized for being over the top and out of touch. Trump s predecessor Michelle Obama was often lauded for wearing J.Crew during her time in the White House, coming across as a more relatable and accessible First Lady than many in the past. It seems entirely possible that Trump is ripping out a page from the Obama handbook in order to drum up some much-needed goodwill from the public. ",politics,"Sep 6, 2017"
"N KOREA JUST REVEALED Plans To Unleash An Unimaginable  Attack That Could Lead To Electronic Armageddon","WFB  North Korea for the first time this week revealed plans for using its nuclear arms for space-based electronics-disrupting EMP attacks, in addition to direct warhead ground blasts.The official communist party newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, published a report Monday on  the EMP might of nuclear weapons,  outlining an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) attack produced by detonating a nuclear warhead in space. In general, the strong electromagnetic pulse generated from nuclear bomb explosions between 30 kilometers and 100 kilometers [18.6 miles and 62 miles] above the ground can severely impair electronic devices, electric machines, and electromagnetic grids, or destroy electric cables and safety devices,  said the article authored by Kim Songwon, dean of Kim Chaek University of Technology in Pyongyang. The discovery of the electromagnetic pulse as a source of high yield in the high-altitude nuclear explosion test process has given it recognition as an important strike method,  he stated.The official discussion by North Korea of plans to conduct EMP strikes will likely fuel debate over the threat. Former CIA Director James Woolsey has said North Korea is capable of orbiting an EMP nuclear weapon in a satellite.Some liberal arms control advocates have dismissed the EMP threat from Pyongyang as far-fetched, such as arms control advocate Jeffrey Lewis, who in April dismissed the threat of an EMP attack by laughing at a reporter s question.  This is the favorite nightmare scenario of a small group of very dedicated people,  he told NPR.Disclosure of North Korea s intention to use its nuclear force for EMP attacks comes as U.S. intelligence agencies are continuing to analyze the latest underground nuclear test by North Korea on Sept. 3 that the regime said was its first hydrogen bomb explosion.Senior administration officials said initial assessments of the nuclear blast in northeastern North Korea indicate it was the largest test detonation so far, and much larger than an underground test carried out last year. It was the regime s sixth nuclear test.U.S. nuclear technicians have not made a definitive conclusion about the specifics of the device. Specialists are trying to determine if the test involved a hydrogen bomb, as Pyongyang asserted, or a device designed for EMP attack. They are also assessing whether the test used boosted fission technology.Hydrogen bombs are advanced devices that use a two-stage explosion process to produce a massive explosion. Boosted fission devices are less sophisticated technologically and require more nuclear fuel. We re highly confident this was a test of an advanced nuclear device and what we ve seen so far is not inconsistent with North Korea s claims,  a U.S. intelligence official said.However, a final conclusion on the type and yield of the blast is not expected for several days. Data from the test is being analyzed by nuclear weapons experts at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico.Also, the large explosion perhaps more than 100 kilotons, or the equivalent of 100 tons of TN likely produced significant venting of radioactive particles into the air.Special U.S. intelligence aircraft, including the WC-135 nuclear  sniffer  jets, are conducting flights near the test zone to gather samples of particles from the test.EXPERTS ARE SAYING AN EMP ATTACK BY N KOREA IS A VERY REAL AND DARK POSSIBILITYAccording to the Business Insider, some experts believe that the more realistic threat at this point in time is an EMP attack. To make that happen, all North Korea has to do is launch a low-yield nuclear missile from a submarine, ship, or even by balloon and explode it at high altitude, above the atmosphere.The potential result: a blackout of the Eastern grid that supplies 75% of power to the United States.If an EMP attack did take place, it would be beyond anything we have seen before. The Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse Attack, which was established by Congress in 2001, estimates that within 12 months following a nationwide blackout,  up to 90% of the US population could perish from starvation, disease, and societal breakdown. Electronic ArmageddonIn practical terms, a catastrophic blackout would be worst in cities, because it would instantly deprive the population of access to drinking water, refrigeration, heat, air conditioning, and telecommunication. Food stores would be looted within a matter of days, and gas stations would cease to function without electricity.Without Internet access and power, all commerce and advanced methods of communication would stop. There would be no TV, radio, phones. Credit card transactions and cash withdrawals at banks would be impossible. Paper money would become worthless, and Bitcoin would cease to exist, along with the stock market.Newt Gingrich, speaking at the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources earlier this month, said an EMP attack  would send us back to the 18th century. But that s not the only problem. If no outside help arrives, within days, chaos begins to reign. Civilization is a rather thin veneer that humans have acquired over centuries, a mask covering our hard-wired survival instincts. Once the mask slips, it could mean the end of the world as we know it.We are Ill-Prepared For An EMP AttackUS politicians and major utilities have kicked the can down the road when it comes to EMP preparation. Edison Electric estimates that shielding transformers for the US grid system could cost $20 billion.Granted, American power companies have been studying ways to protect our electronic grids against attack, but tangible results are slow in coming.The only current option after an EMP attack would be to replace damaged or destroyed transformers. However, says Scott Aaronson, managing director for Cyber and Infrastructure Security at Edison Electric, replacements for those transformers must be procured from foreign suppliers, which could take up to 18 months.Peter Vincent Pry, leader of the Task Force on National and Homeland Security, believes North Korea is closer to launching an EMP attack than many analysts believe. He wants Congress to work harder and cut the red tape to allow the innovation necessary to mitigate the threat.In Pry s opinion, an EMP attack would ultimately kill more Americans than a direct nuclear blast could. His book, The Long Sunday, describes several plausible EMP attack scenarios.Pry thinks that  the first nation to use nuclear weapons today even a rogue state like North Korea or Iran will immediately become the most feared and credible nuclear power in the world, a formidable force to be reckoned with, and perhaps the dominant actor in a new world order. Is there a sensible way to prepare for an EMP attack?Maybe not, but stocking some food, water, fuel, and batteries for emergencies is always a good idea as well as owning a stash of gold coins as hard assets.While  you can t eat gold,  as some preppers say, it is the only kind of money that has prevailed over the millennia. Kim, the North Korean technical university dean, stated that high-altitude explosions can be conducted in the stratosphere or in space where the blast wave is limited by the lack of air or the thinness of air. In explosions occurring at such altitudes, large amounts of electrons are released as a result of ionization reactions of high-energy instant gamma rays and other radioactive rays,  he said.  These electrons form a strong electromagnetic pulse (EMP) through interaction with the geomagnetic field. The detonation would create a strong electric field of 100,000 volts per meter when it approaches the ground and  that is how it destroys communications facilities and electricity grids,  the report said.The EMP report was published Monday, a day after the same state-run outlet reported on a visit by North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to a nuclear weapons facility that also mentioned plans for using nuclear weapons in EMP attacks. Our hydrogen bomb whose power as a nuclear bomb can be adjusted at will from tens of kilotons to hundreds of kilotons according to the targets of strike is a multifunctional thermonuclear warhead which not only has enormous lethality and destructibility, but also can even carry out super-powerful EMP attack over an expansive area through detonation at high altitudes according to strategic goals,  the report said.

"RINO SENATOR From Red State Tells Illegal Aliens: You Have Done Nothing Wrong&Joins Dems To Push DREAM ACT Legislation Only Hours After Trump Rescinds DACA [VIDEO]","Here are a few facts explaining who the DACA recipients really are.  The National UnDACAmented Research Project was compiled by Harvard University researcher Roberto G. Gonzales and published by the Center For Immigration Studies (CIS):In April 2016, the Washington Times reported that a massive anti-deportation infrastructure had emerged to try to protect illegal immigrants from President Trump s crackdown, with advocacy groups coaching potential deportees on how to massage encounters with police, and lawyers and judges working to shield them from charges that would make them priorities for deportation.A video released Monday by a coalition of advocates instructs illegal immigrants not to open the door to federal agents, what proof to demand if they are being arrested and what to say if accosted outside their homes.Meanwhile, attorneys are working to lower charges from some illegal immigrant criminals, hoping to blunt their crimes so they don t show up as high-priority deportation targets.The Washington Times reported on a recent case in California, where an immigrant from India was accused of abusing his wife. The Santa Clara prosecutor told The Daily Beast that he reduced a felony assault charge to a felony accessory after the fact charge in order to spare the man a sentence that would have made him a deportation risk.IJR- The same day that President Donald Trump  rescinded  the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) held a joint press conference in which they reintroduced legislation that would see Congress tackling many of the issues that DACA comprises. What Senator Graham and I want to deliver is the message today, is that we need to do our job right here in the United States Senate,  Durbin said.  We need to pass, in this month of September, a DREAM Act, a permanent law in this country, that says that these young people will have their chance to become part of America s future. The DREAM   Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors   Act has been circling Congress for more than a decade, having first been introduced by Durbin and Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) in 2001. The legislation has failed to pass each time it has been introduced.Durbin then took a moment to speak directly to the DREAMers, saying,  Do not give up hope. If you are one of those DREAMers,  Durbin continued,  one of those protected by DACA, you need to be part of America in its future. We made a promise to you that if you gave this information to our government about you and your family, it wouldn t be used against you. I don t want that to ever happen. Durbin then turned over the podium to Graham, who said right out of the gate, speaking to the DACA participants,  you have done nothing wrong. You ve demonstrated your ability to be beneficial to the country now and in the future,  Graham said.  The only thing that stands between you and certainty in your life is the Congress. That cannot be that reassuring. Congress is going to have to up its game,  Graham opined. ",politics,"Sep 6, 2017"

According to the party, the board responded with a list of 1,101,178 individuals, though its website reflects 1,115,664 votes cast. There should never be more votes than voters every ballot cast should be recorded against a registered voter,  Chairman of the Chicago GOP Chris Cleveland told Fox News, explaining that after receiving the data, the party  immediately  contacted the board for  clarification.   This is either massive fraud or massive incompetence, but we have no way of telling the difference because they won t give us the data. The discrepancy totals more than 14,000, though Cleveland claims it could be as high as 16,000.Cleveland told Fox News he filed a number of FOIA requests the original in January, and  several follow ups  for updated numbers.

To target these young people is wrong   because they have done nothing wrong,  Obama wrote in a Facebook post published hours after Trump announced his decision in a written statement following a speech by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.  It is self-defeating   because they want to start new businesses, staff our labs, serve in our military, and otherwise contribute to the country we love. And it is cruel. No, what s cruel is having open borders to allow these people in. What s cruel is to have this unConstitutional policy that now Trump has to deal with. President Trump is the adult in the room of a bunch of lawless cowards.OBAMA S STATEMENT: Immigration can be a controversial topic. We all want safe, secure borders and a dynamic economy, and people of goodwill can have legitimate disagreements about how to fix our immigration system so that everybody plays by the rules. But that s not what the action that the White House took today is about. This is about young people who grew up in America   kids who study in our schools, young adults who are starting careers, patriots who pledge allegiance to our flag. These Dreamers are Americans in their hearts, in their minds, in every single way but one: on paper. They were brought to this country by their parents, sometimes even as infants. They may not know a country besides ours. They may not even know a language besides English. They often have no idea they re undocumented until they apply for a job, or college, or a driver s license. Over the years, politicians of both parties have worked together to write legislation that would have told these young people   our young people   that if your parents brought you here as a child, if you ve been here a certain number of years, and if you re willing to go to college or serve in our military, then you ll get a chance to stay and earn your citizenship. And for years while I was President, I asked Congress to send me such a bill. That bill never came. And because it made no sense to expel talented, driven, patriotic young people from the only country they know solely because of the actions of their parents, my administration acted to lift the shadow of deportation from these young people, so that they could continue to contribute to our communities and our country. We did so based on the well-established legal principle of prosecutorial discretion, deployed by Democratic and Republican presidents alike, because our immigration enforcement agencies have limited resources, and it makes sense to focus those resources on those who come illegally to this country to do us harm. Deportations of criminals went up. Some 800,000 young people stepped forward, met rigorous requirements, and went through background checks. And America grew stronger as a result. But today, that shadow has been cast over some of our best and brightest young people once again. To target these young people is wrong   because they have done nothing wrong. It is self-defeating   because they want to start new businesses, staff our labs, serve in our military, and otherwise contribute to the country we love. And it is cruel. What if our kid s science teacher, or our friendly neighbor turns out to be a Dreamer? Where are we supposed to send her? To a country she doesn t know or remember, with a language she may not even speak? Let s be clear: the action taken today isn t required legally. It s a political decision, and a moral question. Whatever concerns or complaints Americans may have about immigration in general, we shouldn t threaten the future of this group of young people who are here through no fault of their own, who pose no threat, who are not taking away anything from the rest of us. They are that pitcher on our kid s softball team, that first responder who helps out his community after a disaster, that cadet in ROTC who wants nothing more than to wear the uniform of the country that gave him a chance. Kicking them out won t lower the unemployment rate, or lighten anyone s taxes, or raise anybody s wages. It is precisely because this action is contrary to our spirit, and to common sense, that business leaders, faith leaders, economists, and Americans of all political stripes called on the administration not to do what it did today. And now that the White House has shifted its responsibility for these young people to Congress, it s up to Members of Congress to protect these young people and our future. I m heartened by those who ve suggested that they should. And I join my voice with the majority of Americans who hope they step up and do it with a sense of moral urgency that matches the urgency these young people feel. Ultimately, this is about basic decency. This is about whether we are a people who kick hopeful young strivers out of America, or whether we treat them the way we d want our own kids to be treated. It s about who we are as a people   and who we want to be. What makes us American is not a question of what we look like, or where our names come from, or the way we pray. What makes us American is our fidelity to a set of ideals   that all of us are created equal; that all of us deserve the chance to make of our lives what we will; that all of us share an obligation to stand up, speak out, and secure our most cherished values for the next generation. That s how America has traveled this far. That s how, if we keep at it, we will ultimately reach that more perfect union. Read more: DM",politics,"Sep 5, 2017"

Just last week, he trashed Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who s jobless right now because he dared challenge the nation s racism with a silent, kneeling protest during the pre-football game singing of the national anthem.Having Kid Rock open this arena is erecting a sturdy middle finger to Detroiters   nothing less. And the Ilitches, who ve done so much for this city and also taken so much from it, should be the last to embrace that kind of signaling.Sadly, it s people like Stephen Henderson who are so steeped in hate for anyone who doesn t buy into his embarrassing attempts to shame the white man, that will help to keep the hateful and divisive course Barack Obama set for our nation alive and well ",politics,"Sep 5, 2017"

There are important (self-acknowledged) caveats to the findings: The research is based on an online survey of just over 2,000 self-described DACA-eligible respondents and about 200 follow-up interviews. Gonzales believes that for a variety of reasons, the respondents are more educated and well-off than the DACA population as a whole.Nevertheless, the findings are interesting. Here is a sample:73 percent of DACA recipients he surveyed live in a low-income household (defined as qualifying for free lunch in high school); 22 percent have earned a degree from a four-year college or university; 21 percent have dropped out of high school; 20 percent have no education beyond high school and no plans to attend college; 59 percent obtained a new job with a DACA work permit, but only 45 percent increased their overall earnings; 36 percent have a parent who holds a bachelor s degree; and 51 percent were already employed before DACA. None of this is to suggest that these individuals should not be considered for an amnesty or legalization program, but to suggest that the arguments in favor of such a program are largely political rather than economic. Immigrants who are not highly educated and who are working in low-paying jobs are more likely to access welfare and other public assistance programs over the course of their lives.

"OBAMA THREATENS TO SURFACE FROM LEFTIST BUNKER To Speak Out Against Trumps Plan To End DACA","Contrary to what the media would like us to believe, Obama has not remained silent when it comes to policy that President Trump put in place by executive order. Neither he nor his Democratic henchmen remained silent when President Trump desperately tried to convince Congress to repeal and replace Obamacare, or when he had the opportunity to attack him over his handling of the Charlottesville controversy. The media celebrated Obama s post-Charlotseville tweet designed to make our former President look like he was in favor of uniting the nation (which we all know is a bald-faced lie), while falsely giving the impression that President Trump was choosing sides.Before the media gets into a full-blown tizzy about Obama using social media to bash our current president over DACA, they might consider that most of America aren t stupid enough to believe that Valerie Jarrett didn t move into Barack Obama s DC home because he needed a friend to play checkers with. He may not be making public statements to voice his opposition against our current president, but one thing we do know is that he and Valerie Jarrett aren t sitting on their hands, while President Trump unwinds everything they worked so hard to make happen, including DACA.Hotair   You know it s killing this guy not to be on camera every day scolding Trump in his usual  that s not who we are  terms but that would be a strategic disaster so obvious that silence is really the only option. A  Trump vs. Obama  fight over almost any issue would unify most of the right behind the president and O knows it; the most brutal thing he can do to Trump is to deny him that our-guy-versus-their-guy dynamic. I don t think it s crazy to believe that Trump s job approval would be five to 10 points higher if Obama had spent the last seven months sniping at him regularly. By withholding his criticism, he s made it possible for  soft  Republicans and right-leaning independents to criticize POTUS without fear of being accused that they re carrying O s water.Two days before President Trump s inauguration, Obama warned him that he would come out against him if Trump rescinded his unconstitutional DACA.Why attack Trump now? I think there s more to it than DACA just being near and dear to Obama s heart. He knows that congressional Republicans are going to be jammed up here to an unusual degree. Immigration is a fraught issue for the GOP under the best of circumstances but DREAMers are an especially hard case due to their having come here as children. They re the one class of illegals about whom even Trump speaks warmly. In fact, the president s going to end DACA not because he wants to but because Republican AGs are squeezing him to do so, replete with the threat of a court battle; even then, Trump is still so reluctant to pull the plug that he s willing to hold off for another six months. The entire GOP (apart from Steve King) will spend those six months telling every voter who listens that they re open to legalizing DREAMers. All they ask in return is some face-saving security measures so that they can semi-plausibly argue to their base that they didn t roll over completely on amnesty.Having Obama wade in publicly on the side of DREAMers will complicate all of that. With O banging the drum for amnesty, Republican voters who are lukewarm on the idea in the first place will start to turn frosty. Populists will have a field day attacking Ryan and McConnell (and Trump?) for essentially doing Obama s bidding by negotiating for a DREAM bill. Some congressional Republicans might start to get cold feet. The more hostile Trump and the congressional GOP become towards a DREAM deal as part of a backlash towards Obama, the more ammo Schumer will have to say that Republicans are being cruel to poor illegal children whose only mistake was trusting the federal government. The whole GOP  we like DREAMers too!  messaging effort will be scrambled. Either negotiations will end up collapsing in Congress, with Dems using the DREAM failure against Republicans next fall, or Trump, Ryan, and McConnell will have to swallow hard and approve an amnesty cheered on by Barack farking Obama, which is about the RINO-iest move a modern Republican is capable of making. Either the GOP base ends up angry at the White House or everyone else does. Obama  speaking out  is tinder for the match Trump is about to strike.Let s hope President Trump will be able to locate and tweet this pesky little video of candidate Obama telling his constituents how he disagrees with law breaking illegal aliens living and working in America:",politics,"Sep 4, 2017"

"Trump Diversity Council Member Threatens to Quit If Trump Ends DACA&Bye, Bye!

Bye Bye!Trump diversity council member tells @Acosta he may quit the council if Trump moves ahead to end DACA https://t.co/CCn90EgSdn  CNN Newsroom (@CNNnewsroom) September 4, 2017 I want to remind him and his team that from an economic standpoint, and again, we re business people if you look at this from a purely economic standpoint again, none of these young people gets government benefits of any sorts so they re not costing us anything. They pay over $2 billion in taxes Is anyone else out there sick of the American people being told illegals cost nothing?DACA Will Cost Americans And Their Government A Huge Amount of Money.On average, people with college degrees pay more in taxes than they receive in government benefits. People without a degree consume more taxes than they pay to federal, state and local tax officials.In 2013, a Heritage Foundation study showed that amnesty for 11 million illegals would spike federal spending by $6,300 billion over the next five decades. That is roughly equivalent to $550,000 per illegal, or $10,000 per illegal per year, much of which will be spent when the immigrant becomes eligible for Social Security and Medicare. That cost estimate does not include the extra costs created when immigrants use their new legal powers as a citizen to bring in more low-skilled migrants.If those 3 million DACA people and their parents soon become legal residents or citizens, then Obama s DACA will cost Americans roughly $1,700 billion over the next 50 years, according to Heritage Foundation s numbers.Moreover, the DACA migrants add to the flood of illegal labor that has driven down wages for ordinary Americans, including urban youths and recent immigrants. Currently, Americans lose roughly $500 billion a year from their salaries because of the immigration tax caused by cheap labor according to the academies  report.Via: GP",politics,"Sep 4, 2017"

"Gov. Cuomo Defends Not Endorsing Mayor de Blasio&Speaks Up On Offensive Statues Of Christopher Columbus","NY Governor Andrew Cuomo made two shocking announcements regarding the Christopher Columbus Statues and about his decision not to endorse NY Mayor de Blasio.During an appearance at the West Indian Day Parade on Monday, Gov. Cuomo said statues of the famous Italian explorer should remain in the public square: The Christopher Columbus statue is really about honoring Italian Americans. I for one for obvious reasons happen to believe in the Italian-American heritage. I believe in the contribution Italian-Americans have made, just as I believe in celebrating the Caribbean and the Israel day parade. NO ENDORSEMENT?   A BATTLE ROYAL BETWEEN TWO DEM HEAVYWEIGHTSGov. Andrew Cuomo said he isn t endorsing Mayor Bill de Blasio for re-election   because he lives in Westchester. I don t vote in the primary election. I m a Westchester resident,  he said.  I m not voting in this election, so I don t have any primary endorsements at this time. The Democratic primary is Sept. 12, and de Blasio is heavily favored to win. The mayor endorsed Cuomo months before the Democratic primary in 2014.Cuomo s non-endorsement of de Blasio is just the latest example of sniping between the two Democratic Party power brokers. We didn t ask for his support,  said de Blasio campaign spokeswoman Monica Klein. A FIRESTORM OF CRITICISM If this doesn t sink the mayor s reelection efforts, we don t know what will! When de Blasio announced he would form a committee of people who would decide which statues are  offensive  then take them down, we knew it was going to be a rough go for de Blasio. You don t tell the Italian community to take down Christopher Columbus statues! Cuomo said it best when he finally came out with a statement in support of keeping the statues: The Italian American contribution and the Italian American culture is a big part if what makes New York, New York,  Cuomo said.There have been several protests regarding this move by de Blasio so he s now backtracking on his decision:Mayor de Blasio and Council Speaker Melissa Mark Viverito have come under a firestorm of criticism for mulling the removal of a Christopher Columbus statues   including the 76-foot structure in Columbus Square   as part of a review of offensive monuments. The mayor has backtracked following the outcry. There s no plan to remove the Columbus statue,  said de Blasio spokesman Eric Phillips.While the Italian explorer is revered for discovering the New World, Columbus  detractors said he mistreated and enslaved native Caribbean populations and doesn t deserve to be extolled.CUOMO NEEDED TO FIRST PUT HIS WET FINGER INTO THE WIND TO SEE HOW OPINION WAS GOINGIt s the first time Cuomo has waded in on the controversy after declining comment last week.

"CNN Publishes Inauguration Day Letter from Obama to Trump: Keep International Order","CNN has published the Inauguration Day letter from Obama to incoming President Trump. The letter includes the usual pleasantries then asks Trump to keep the  international order  going. Hummm, that s a loaded demand because then-candidate Trump s stump mantra was to put America first. Um, yeah no May of 2010 is when Obama declared a  new international order was needed: President Obama is facing criticism for his declaration over the weekend that he would seek a new  international order,  with some questioning how much U.S. sovereignty the administration is willing to cede in exchange for more global cooperation. Trump campaigned on upsetting the apple cart for this new globalism and liberal political hack Fareed Zakaria wrote about the end to this  international order  in a Washington Post OpEd in which he bashed Trump s America first policy:In his first days in office, President Trump has begun to reverse the domestic policies of the previous eight years. But with regard to the United States  relations with the world, Trump seems far more radical. In word and deed, he appears to be walking away from the idea of America at the center of an open, rule-based international order. This would be a reversal of more than 70 years of U.S. foreign policy.CNN reports:During his final moments in the Oval Office, President Barack Obama folded into thirds a handwritten letter to Donald Trump, slid it into an envelope, and in neat capital letters addressed it to  Mr. President. Now, the contents of that letter   the last direct communication between the 44th and 45th presidents   have emerged for the first time after CNN obtained a copy.Full text of the letter:Dear Mr. President  Congratulations on a remarkable run. Millions have placed their hopes in you, and all of us, regardless of party, should hope for expanded prosperity and security during your tenure.This is a unique office, without a clear blueprint for success, so I don t know that any advice from me will be particularly helpful. Still, let me offer a few reflections from the past 8 years.First, we ve both been blessed, in different ways, with great good fortune. Not everyone is so lucky. It s up to us to do everything we can (to) build more ladders of success for every child and family that s willing to work hard.Second, American leadership in this world really is indispensable. It s up to us, through action and example, to sustain the international order that s expanded steadily since the end of the Cold War, and upon which our own wealth and safety depend.Third, we are just temporary occupants of this office. That makes us guardians of those democratic institutions and traditions   like rule of law, separation of powers, equal protection and civil liberties   that our forebears fought and bled for. Regardless of the push and pull of daily politics, it s up to us to leave those instruments of our democracy at least as strong as we found them.And finally, take time, in the rush of events and responsibilities, for friends and family. They ll get you through the inevitable rough patches.

"LOL! SHAKEDOWN ARTIST JESSE JACKSON TELLS CROWD: President Trump Would Not Qualify To Get Into Jesus Kingdom [VIDEO]","Here s a 1999 video of Jesse Jackson praising Donald Trump for his contribution to the black community, awarding him with a lifetime achievement award for African Americans:What a difference a few years (and an [R] behind your name can make:WFB   While speaking to a crowd at the  Ministers March for Justice  Rev. Jesse Jackson suggested that President Trump should be worried about gaining citizenship in heaven. Trump says you must be able to speak the language of English, [be] qualified, and have a job skill,  Jackson said Monday.  Jesus would not qualify to come in Trump s country he would not qualify to get into Jesus  kingdom. It s difficult to understand Jackson in the video below, as he mumbles through much of his commentary. (For translation, see quotes above):The  Ministers March for Justice,  was spearheaded by Rev. Al Sharpton and featured ministers from various traditions united in opposing the Trump administration. The event took place on the 54th anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr. s March on Washington, and Jackson did not shy away from using religious language to judge the president.After judging Trump s ability to enter heaven, he quoted part of a passage from the Gospel of Matthew, in which Jesus says what he will tell his followers at the Final Judgment.Is the notorious shake down artist Jesse Jackson really one to be deciding who will and who will not be given admittance to heaven? In 2006, government watchdog Judicial Watch released a report that revealed new details about the intimidation and shakedown tactics of Jesse Jackson s Rainbow Push Coalition.WND   The report,  Jesse Jackson Exposed,  claims Jackson is  an extortionist who uses his influence as a civil rights leader to essentially blackmail wealthy corporations with absurd discrimination threats. Included, the group says, are  incriminating admissions from Jackson made under oath at trial. Among the tactics highlighted in the report are:Jackson lobbied the Federal Communications Commission to block companies seeking government approval to merge until they donate money to Rainbow Push.Jackson publicly chastised Toyota for running an ad Jackson deemed  racist.  After Toyota pulled the ad, Jackson threatened a boycott the automaker to force it to launch a $7.8 million  diversity program. Jackson installed one of his friends, J.L. Armstrong, in a management position at Toyota to determine which organizations would receive $700 million in contracts awarded by Toyota.Minority businesses pay Jackson s  Trade Bureau  a fee to help extort lucrative contracts from corporations. During the trial, Jackson compared the Trade Bureau to  Noah s Ark,  claiming minority businesses and organizations had to be inside the  ark  to survive. Judicial Watch brought the lawsuit against Jackson, his son Jonathan Jackson and Rainbow Push Coalition on behalf of Rev. Jesse Lee Peterson, a black minister and founder of the Los Angeles-based Brotherhood Organization for a New Destiny.Peterson wrote a book titled,  Scam,  that takes Jackson to task as one of America s  self-appointed  black leaders. I don t recall the entire black race in this country taking a national vote to elect Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton, Louis Farrakhan, the NAACP, California Congresswoman Maxine Waters, the Congressional Black Caucus or liberal black preachers as our leaders,  Peterson writes,  yet they ve seized the mantle of leadership and claim to speak for all blacks in this nation. Another expose of Jackson, Kenneth Timmerman s book  Shakedown: Exposing the real Jesse Jackson,  goes back several decades, including his ordination as a reverend. I describe a two to three year process for earning that title,  Timmerman said.  Jesse Jackson got himself ordained two months after Martin Luther King was shot. It was essentially a  political ordination,  a  shotgun ordination.  He did not go through the long procedure. He was not licensed to preach, as far as I could determine. I went to the church where he was ordained. He did not go through this two-year process. He never submitted himself to the authority of the church. He has never had a church himself, and he has been accountable to no one.  Timmerman asserts Jackson  is not doing things to help the black community. Jesse Jackson is   to help himself first.

Jackson used religion to bash Trump during the event: He quoted part of a passage from the gospel of Matthew: I was hungry, you fed me; naked, you clothed me; captive, you set me free. Jackson was referring to the fact that he believes in open borders and welcoming arms for everyone. Nice try, it s just not true that a nation can survive without borders.

It s a snoozer of an OpEd until you get to the last part In a shocking slam on President Trump s character and knowledge of government, McCain shows his bitterness towards Trump. He claims that,  We don t answer to him   but also say that,  We must respect his authority WTH!MCCAIN: IT S TIME CONGRESS RETURNS TO REGULAR ORDER: We can fight like hell for our ideas to prevail. But we have to respect each other or at least respect the fact that we need each other.That has never been truer than today, when Congress must govern with a president who has no experience of public office, is often poorly informed and can be impulsive in his speech and conduct.We must respect his authority and constitutional responsibilities. We must, where we can, cooperate with him. But we are not his subordinates. We don t answer to him. We answer to the American people. We must be diligent in discharging our responsibility to serve as a check on his power. And we should value our identity as members of Congress more than our partisan affiliation.I argued during the health-care debate for a return to regular order, letting committees of jurisdiction do the principal work of crafting legislation and letting the full Senate debate and amend their efforts.We won t settle all our differences that way, but such an approach is more likely to make progress on the central problems confronting our constituents. We might not like the compromises regular order requires, but we can and must live with them if we are to find real and lasting solutions. And all of us in Congress have the duty, in this sharply polarized atmosphere, to defend the necessity of compromise before the American public.SEE WHAT HE DID THERE? He basically said our president is clueless and impulsive so we don t need to listen to him. Unreal! Is McCain bitter and trying to get back at Trump?

"DISCOVERED: FORMER PAKISTANI-BORN MUSLIM IT AIDE Under Investigation By FBI For Stealing Data From Congress Has ACTIVE House Email Account TIED TO MUSLIM US Rep André Carson","A former IT aide suspected of stealing equipment and data from Congress still has an active, secret email account on the House computer system, even though he has been banned from the congressional network because of a criminal investigation into the alleged cybersecurity violations, The Daily Caller News Foundation Investigative Group has learned.Imran Awan s still-active email address is linked to the name of a House staffer who specializes in intelligence and homeland security matters for Indiana Democratic Rep. Andr  Carson. Court documents and emails obtained by TheDCNF show Awan used the address 123@mail.house.gov in addition to his standard imran.awan@mail.house.gov account.He and two of his Pakistani-born brothers, as well as his wife, are at the center of an FBI investigation over their IT work with dozens of Democratic congressional offices. Authorities shut down Awan s standard email account Feb. 2, and he was arrested by the FBI at Dulles International Airport trying to board a flight to his native Pakistan on July 25.Authorities apparently did not realize Awan has a second account that is not linked to his identity. While his main email address began rejecting mail after it was shut down, the 123 address was still accepting mail Tuesday.Mail sent via Gmail fills in the name of the account-holder of 123 as Nathan Bennett, whose LinkedIn profile says his individual legislative portfolio covers  national security and foreign affairs  and includes work on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.The member Bennett works for, Andre Carson is a member of both the House Intelligence and House Homeland Security Committees, and previously employed Awan.Carson is ranking member of the House intelligence subcommittee on emerging threats, which oversees the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. The subcommittee oversight extends to the National Counterterrorism Center and information-sharing programs. For entire story: Daily Caller So who is US Rep. Andre Carson, and why should we be concerned about the Pakistani born Muslim IT Aide hired by the former DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman-Schultz? Andre Carson is one of only two Muslims serving in Congress. The other is Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., who became the first Muslim elected to Congress in 2006. Andre Carson has openly stated that American schools should be modeled after Islamic Madrassas. America will never tap into educational innovation and ingenuity without looking at the model that we have in our madrassas, in our schools, where innovation is encouraged, where the foundation is the Quran. And that model that we are pushing in some of our schools meets the multiple needs of students. Watch at the 6:25 mark:Shoebat- The next time the American people are told by a U.S. member of Congress that they can t know something because it is  classified  or  still under investigation , they should point their collective finger directly at one man   Andre Carson. The reason is that Carson is not just one of the only two Muslim members of Congress; he is now a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI), appointed by House Minority leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA).If ever there was a committee that has been able to hide behind the claim that it can t answer a question because that answer would reveal classified information, HPSCI is such a committee.The problem isn t solely that Carson is a Muslim. It s also that he s accepted contributions from the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) and is tied to other Muslim Brotherhood front groups. CAIR was an unindicted co-conspirator in the Holy Land Foundation (HLF) trial, which actually represents an additional problem. That problem is that it reveals another extremely fundamental flaw in the Bill Clinton strategy of treating acts of terrorism as criminal acts instead of as acts of war. ",politics,"Aug 30, 2017"

Sheila Jackson Lee telling her that it was being pointed out that,  A whole bunch of Texas lawmakers voted against sending financial aid to the victims of Superstorm Sandy when they needed it in 2012 and 2013. Why didn t you vote at that time to help Sandy victims?   Camerota asked. Well, at the time, we helped Sandy victims. The Democrats wanted more money. We didn t get all the money we needed. Frankly, um we did vote. I did vote on the maximum money. Unfortunately, it did not pass. Why didn t you vote for H.R. 152, that was the Appropriations Act of 2013, that all sorts of Texas lawmakers voted against and you just did not vote? Why did you skip that one? As I said, I voted on legislation to help the Sandy Hook victims,  Jackson Lee responded. Camerota corrected her, Sandy superstorm, At the conclusion of the interview,  Allison Camerota took the time to clarify that Just so that we re clear, we re talking about  Superstorm Sandy, not the Sandy Hook shooting.Immediately following Camerota s clairification, Jackson Lee clarified that yes, she is complete bafoon, as she ended the interview by clarifying that she was indeed talking about the mass murder of small children in New Jersey vs. the superstorm:  Let me be clear, I voted on many votes for Sandy Hook funding. Another reporter attempted to point out that Repbulican Senator Ted Cruz voted aginst a $50 billion bill that was supposedly intended to help Sandy Superstorm victims. Unlike dingbat Representative Sheila Jackson-Lee, Senator Cruz offered a legitimate reason for not supporting the bill that was filled with pork by legislators who weren t acting in the best interest of Sandy Superstorm victims. The accurate thing to say is that I and a number of others enthusiastically and emphatically supported hurricane relief for Sandy,  the senator told the MSNBC host.  The problem with that particular bill is it became a $50 billion bill that was filled with unrelated pork it s not right for politicians to exploit a disaster when people are hurting to pay for their own political wish list.

Horace Frank with the Los Angeles Police Department stated in a press conference in October 2016: The male caller threatened to kill the person who answered the phone along with other members of the center because of the caller s hatred for Muslims and his belief that Muslims will destroy the United States. The Rebel has obtained new documents and evidence through police disclosure surrounding the case which proves that the first phone call made to the Islamic Center came from the phone of a different California man, Michael Slawson.Michael Slawson is the son of Democratically appointed Los Angeles Superior Court Judge John Slawson.In other words, Slawson s father is a judge in the same justice system under which Feigin was charged.",politics,"Aug 29, 2017"

The Department of Homeland Security announced Monday that it will soon require more people to undergo in-person interviews before they can gain a firmer legal footing in the U.S., carrying out yet another part of President Trump s extreme vetting executive order.While the so-called travel ban on six Muslim-majority countries has garnered most of the attention, it was just a temporary measure designed to give the government the space to stiffen its regular checks so it could be more adept at denying potential terrorists entry.U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced one of those new policies Monday, saying it wants more people to have to face in-person interviews before they re giving permanent status in the country.

The criminals he released included terrorists and even prisoners from  America s Most Wanted  list. One of his most reckless and horrific releases however, was that of Wendell Callahan, a convicted crack dealer who committed an unimaginable crime against an innocent family.A convicted crack dealer who left prison early as part of the Obama administration s mass release of federal inmates was  indicted by a grand jury for fatally stabbing his ex-girlfriend and her two kids in Columbus, Ohio. The gory crime drew national attention because the children, ages 7 and 10, were murdered to eliminate them as witnesses in the brutal massacre of their 32-year-old mother.This week a grand jury in Franklin County returned a 10-count, death-penalty indictment against the ex-con, 35-year-old Wendell Callahan, for the triple murders. Callahan broke into his ex-girlfriend s apartment and stabbed the three victims, according to a statement issued by Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O Brien announcing the indictment. The bloody crime scene was discovered by the woman s current boyfriend, who subsequently engaged in a fight with Callahan before he fled. The indictment includes charges of aggravated murder with prior calculation and design and aggravated murder of victims under the age of 13.  There are multiple charges regarding the three victim deaths because there are different methods to commit the crime of murder and the Prosecutor s Office typically charges all methods , O Brien stated. Callahan is in jail on $3 million bail and is scheduled to be arraigned later this week.Callahan should have been in jail when the crimes occurred, but he was released four years early because federal sentencing guidelines for crack dealers got reduced. The change was part of President Obama s effort to reform the nation s justice system as a way of ending racial discrimination. The initiative was technically launched back in 2010 when the president signed a measure that for the first time in decades relaxed drug-crime sentences he claimed discriminated against poor and minority offenders. This severely weakened a decades-old law enacted during the infamous crack cocaine epidemic that ravaged urban communities nationwide in the 1980s. As part of the movement the U.S. Sentencing Commission lowered maximum sentences for drug offenders and made it retroactive, leading to the early release of thousands of violent thugs like Callahan.In November of 2016, the administration began releasing 6,000 drug convicts coined  non-violent  offenders whose sentences were too long under the old guidelines. News reports quickly surfaced contradicting the administration s assessment that the newly released convicts were not violent. Among them was the leader of a multi-million dollar operation that smuggled drugs from Canada to Maine. Prosecutors refer to the 29-year-old con as a  drug kingpin  who was one of  America s Most Wanted.  Shortly before the administration s mass release of drug convicts, federal prosecutors warned that drug trafficking is inherently violent and therefore the phrase  non-violent drug offenders  is a misnomer. The nation s prosecutors also cautioned that reducing prison sentences for drug offenders will weaken their ability to bring dangerous drug traffickers to justice.As if it weren t bad enough that the administration is rewarding thousands of criminals with get-out-of-jail cards, huge amounts of taxpayer dollars are being spent on programs to help them find housing and jobs.

"About Time! Christian Group Sues Amazon and SPLC for Designation as Hate Group","All we can say on this one is it s about time someone sued the Southern Poverty Law Center!On Tuesday, D. James Kennedy Ministries (DJKM) filed a lawsuit against the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), the charity navigation organization GuideStar, and Amazon, for defamation, religious discrimination, and trafficking in falsehood. The SPLC listed DJKM as a  hate group,  while GuideStar also categorized it in those terms, and Amazon kept the ministry off of its charity donation program, Amazon Smile. We embarked today on a journey to right a terrible wrong,  Dr. Frank Wright, president and CEO at DJKM, said in a statement Tuesday.  Those who knowingly label Christian ministries as  hate  groups, solely for subscribing to the historic Christian faith, are either woefully uninformed or willfully deceitful. In the case of the Southern Poverty Law Center, our lawsuit alleges the latter. The SPLC has labeled DJKM an  anti-LGBT hate group  for its opposition to same-sex marriage and transgenderism.  These false and illegal characterizations have a chilling effect on the free exercise of religion and on religious free speech for all people of faith,  Wright declared. After having given the SPLC an opportunity to retract, we have undertaken this legal action, seeking a trial by a jury of our peers, to preserve our own rights under the law and to defend the religious free speech rights of all Americans,  the DJKM president concluded.The lawsuit laid out charges against the SPLC, GuideStar, and Amazon.Read more: PJM",politics,"Aug 27, 2017"

"SIX FACTS ABOUT Sheriff Joe Arpaio Case That Will Shut Down Every Liberal Crying Foul Over President Trumps Pardon","Attorney Dario Navarro was one of several leftists who were all of a sudden concerned about the  constitutionality  of President Trump s actions.If Trump issued pardon with specific intent to obstruct justice, it could be challenged as unconstitutional abuse of discretion. #Dems pic.twitter.com/1p9981yyMD  Dario Navarro (@darionavarro111) June 15, 2017Even the New York Times, who helped to sell Barack Obama s horrific Obamacare plan is concerned about Sheriff Joe Arpaio s pardon.Good case for #ArpaioPardon to be considered unconstitutional.Of course, we'd need a congress with a spine first https://t.co/8Z5M1rVr8u  Dimitri (@DimitriWillert) August 26, 2017On July 25, 2016,  America s Sheriff  Joe Arpaio was found guilty of misdemeanor criminal contempt without the benefit of a jury of his peers.Here are a 6 interesting facts that Breitbart News laid out, regarding the Sheriff Joe Arpaio case, that every American crying  foul  over President Trump s pardon yesterday needs to know: The US District judge who tried the case against Sheriff Arpaio was a Bill Clinton appointee. 1. The guilty ruling, by Bill Clinton-appointed U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton, is the latest chapter of a nearly decade-long saga of legal proceedings against Sheriff Joe initiated by leftist groups opposed to his aggressive policing of illegal aliens.The charges against 85 year old Arpaio stem from a civil rights suit demanding he cease  racial profiling  in his Maricopa County Sheriff s Office s immigration enforcement operations. After a federal judge issued an order demanding certain practices, Arpaio was charged with contempt for continuing to try to enforce the law as he saw fit.The misdemeanor charge was a ploy to prevent Sheriff Arpaio from having a jury trial. 2. Because Arpaio was charged only with a misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of six-months in jail, the U.S. Constitution does not guarantee him a right to trial by a jury of his peers. Arpaio and his attorneys repeatedly petitioned for a jury, only to be denied by Judge Bolton in March and again in May. Sources familiar with the proceedings have told Breitbart News the decision to charge only the misdemeanor was likely a ploy by federal prosecutors to avoid a jury trial in the community where Arpaio served as sheriff for more than 20 yearsAccording to the NCPD President, the DOJ had no evidence to make their case against Sheriff Arpaio.3. National Center for Police Defense (NCPD) President James Fotis, who was present in the courtroom, was highly skeptical a Phoenix jury could have ever found Arpaio guilty. He told Breitbart News:I sat through three days of testimony and it was clear from the beginning that the DOJ had no evidence to make their case. In fact, all of the DOJ s witnesses made it clear that Judge Snow s order was unclear and ambiguous. There is no way a jury would have determined that the Sheriff willfully and intentionally violated the judge s order. Judge Bolton s ruling has caused me to lose my faith in the court system and the federal judicial system,  Fotis added in a NCPD press release.Over 40,000 signatures were gathered on a petition by current and former law enforcement officers in support of Sheriff Joe Arpaio who they claimed spent his entire career upholding and defending the Constitution. 4. Fotis was hardly the first or only commentator to question the impartiality of Arpaio s prosecution. In June, his group managed to assemble over 40,000 signatures from current and former law enforcement officers in support of Arpaio, delivering them to the Department of Justice in Washington, DC.  After devoting 56-years of his life to upholding and defending the Constitution, Sheriff Arpaio deserves our nation s eternal gratitude   not jail time,  those petitions read.The Judge in the case should have recused himself, but refused to do so. 5. The initial racial profiling suit that eventually led to this conviction also took on political dimensions and its conduct was criticized. The judge in that case, G. Murray Snow, ignored calls to recuse himself based on the fact his brother-in-law is a partner at Covington & Burling, the firm representing those suing Arpaio and the Maricopa County Sheriff s Office.President Obama spent much of his 8 years in office trying to find a way to take down America s toughest Sheriff on illegal immigrants, who also headed up an independent investigation into the alleged fake birth certificate that would prove Barack Obama was not born in the United States. 6. The decision to criminally prosecute Arpaio was taken while the DOJ was run by Attorney General Loretta Lynch. It would be highly unusual for new leadership to intervene and drop an ongoing prosecution, and no such step was taken, despite the aforementioned petitions. ",politics,"Aug 26, 2017"

They published this story tonight as Hurricane Harvey was hitting the coast of Texas:3 headlines the White House hopes you ll miss as Hurricane Harvey hitsAs the strongest hurricane to make landfall in the US in more than a decade took aim at Texas, President Donald Trump s White House engaged in an age-old Washington tradition: the Friday news dump.Transgender individuals? Banned from joining the military. Convicted Sheriff Joe Arpaio? Officially pardoned. Controversial White House adviser Sebastian Gorka? Out of a white House job.All three headlines popped after 6 p.m. Friday as TV news broadcasts and websites turned their attention to Texas, where Hurricane Harvey was preparing to make landfall as a Category 4 hurricane   the most powerful to hit the US since 2004.CNN probably forgot about Barack Obama s notorious  Friday night news dumps Here are a few of Obama s greatest hits:From Hot Air:Isn t it funny what you can find out on Friday evening about what our executive branch does? For instance, Agence France-Presse reported last night that Barack Obama bypassed Congress to send $192 million to the Palestinian Authority, claiming that national security required the US to put money into Mahmoud Abbas  pocket.Congress deliberately froze those funds, and not just because of the statehood demand through UNESCO. Hamas, a terrorist organization, reconciled with Fatah and has rejoined the PA, which means we re putting almost $200 million into the hands of a terrorist organization. The language of the Palestinian Accountability Act could not be clearer:  [N]o funds available to any United States Government department or agency   may be obligated or expended with respect to providing funds to the Palestinian Authority.  Obama literally waived that statutory language off yesterday afternoon. From Politico:Reporters and Capitol Hill staff tracking the Solyndra saga know better than to make plans for Friday nights: That s when the Obama administration likes to dump documents requested by Congress.At least five times since last fall s bankruptcy filing and FBI raid of the California solar company, the White House and other agencies have chosen to release embarrassing emails and other materials late in the afternoon as the workweek ends   a time almost guaranteed to garner the least media attention possible.From Townhall:The Obama administration Friday pulled the plug on a major program in the president s signature health overhaul law   a long-term care insurance plan dogged from the beginning by doubts over its financial solvency. Targeted by congressional Republicans for repeal, the long-term care plan became the first casualty in the political and policy wars over the health care law. The program had been expected to launch in 2013.  This is a victory for the American taxpayer and future generations,  said Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., spearheading opposition in the Senate.  The administration is finally admitting (the long-term care plan) is unsustainable and cannot be implemented.

The current FEMA director is working to rewrite the Federal Flood Insurance Program so that the federal government bears less of the cost when disasters strike and flooding occurs. On the surface, that might sound like a fiscally responsible move. But it s loaded with inconsistencies and will most certainly not work out well for local cities, states or residents. Additionally, since Trump seems to be firing people weekly but taking his sweet time in hiring them, no one has been appointed to lead both the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association (NOAA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). DHS oversees FEMA and the Coast Guard so it s almost guaranteed that the response to this storm will be chaos. This is shaping up to be another Hurricane Katrina complete with a devastating impact on black and brown communities.Southeast Texas and the coastal bend regions of the state are expected to be the hardest hit. While Hispanics make up about 40 percent of the state s population, Texas has one of the largest black populations in the country. And they live concentrated in the areas that are predicted to be hardest hit. For example, several counties have already been declared a state of disaster by Republican Gov. Greg AbbottNoteworthy also is the high percentage of people in poverty [in Texas] who are African American women, especially single parents. Of the 24% of African Americans below poverty level, single mothers make up 65%. Daily Kos",politics,"Aug 25, 2017"
"WHOA! Did White Supremacist Who Organized Charlottesville Protests Work For CNN? Were Protests Manufactured To Create Hate For Right and Trump?","Has anyone seen Barack Obama lately? What about Valerie Jarrett, who actually MOVED IN to the Obama household shortly after exiting the White House? Why would Obama s 60-year old former senior advisor move into his house with his wife and daughter who is still in high school? Unless there was some obvious reason for her living with the Obama s, it makes no sense whatsoever. Why does no one in the media find this arrangement to be even remotely odd? Is it possible that Barack Obama and his evil puppet-master had something to do with orchestrating what many believe was a fake protest in Charlottesville, as a way to create hate for white people, the Right and more importantly to give Americans a reason to blame President Trump and the Republican Party for the actions of the racist groups who participated in the protests.Immediately after the violence in Charlottesville took place, President Trump took to Twitter and turned to the media to (rightfully) condemn both sides of the conflict.We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 12, 2017Curiously, the former president, who s been keeping a very low profile leading up to the Charlottesville protests, tweeted a response to Charlottesville. CNN called Obama s response on Twitter,  The most linked tweet in the history of Twitter.  CNN was so giddy over the response to Obama s tweet, they actually published an entire story on the success of his tweets:Former President Barack Obama s tweet reacting to the attack in Charlottesville, Virginia, is the most liked tweet ever on the social network.Obama s reaction to the Charlottesville attack is also the fifth-most retweeted behind a tweet from a teen who wanted free chicken nuggets from Wendy s, Ellen Degeneres  tweet from 2014 Oscars, a tweet from singer Louis Tomlinson to his One Direction bandmate Harry Styles and Ariana Grande s previously mentioned tweet.So, what exactly was the media s role in using the Charlottesville protests to push the false narrative that,  President Trump is a racist? Nation One News decided to do a little digging into the leader of the allegedly  White Supremacist  leader who organized the  Unite the Right  rally in Charlottesville, and here are a few very curious things they found:First of all, the ACLU defended Jason Kessler and forced the city to keep his permit in place. This was after the city raised concerns about the ability of Law Enforcement to keep Antifa, BLM, and the New Black Panthers from clashing with the White Supremacists who were attending with Jason Kessler.Here are a few things you need to know about Jason Kessler.First, he supports gun control. Second, he LOVES Obama and Clinton! Third, He LOVED the Iran deal struck by Obama!Fourth, Hates Republicans and compared them to Dahmer.Finally, he claims he was  Red Pilled  into becoming a Trump Supporter ?He claims he was  red pilled  by the  media instigating the Baltimore riots.  However, an Advanced search of his Tweets only reveals one Tweet raising questions or assigning blame for the Baltimore Riots. That Tweet was sent a month AFTER this so called  red pill  or change of heart.So who is this guy really? Well, at least some of rumors on the Internet are True, he was, in fact, a Liberal and he admitted it. His reason for changing his mind doesn t add up, based on the evidence.He has Tweeted 4843 times and he never mentioned the Baltimore Riots prior to his change of heart.One last thing.We are researching to determine if he used to work for or with CNN. CNN has not responded to our calls or emails. It is possible that another Jason Kessler worked for CNN, however, the Jason Kessler from Charlottesville have a gap in his Linked In profile from 2009 to 2013.According to SNOPES, the left wing  fact-checker  source, they ve talked to CNN, who confirms they never employed the Jason Kessler who clashed with BLM and Antifa in Charlottesville. So cased closed right?Here is what the LEFT-wing SNOPES had to say:Did Kessler write articles for CNN that were sympathetic to the Occupy movement?False. Kessler says he never worked for CNN, and we spoke to a source at CNN who confirmed it. A writer named Jason Kessler was once employed by CNN, and he did cover Occupy Wall Street protests among many other topics, but according to CNN it was not the same Jason Kessler who went on to lead Unite the Right.Except that Americans have become much less trusting of these so-called  fact-checkers  and sources they used to believe were honest about the news they reported. We no longer believe anything SNOPES or the Very Fake News CNN has to say. Jason Kessler used to run a blog called jasonkessler.net, however, the site is conveniently taken down.

"WATCH: BLACK SPORTS HOST BLASTS White ESPN Sports Host For Asking White Athletes To Take A Knee During National Anthem","When will Americans stop being afraid of standing up to leftist agitators and tell them,  NO!  When will Americans find a backbone and stop allowing the left to dictate what they re allowed to say or to feel? Why are white Americans allowing themselves and law enforcement officers of every race and ethnicity to be thrown under the bus, because we re led by the radical left to believe that it will somehow make us better people.Oddly, sports channels have decided to assume the role of America s social conscience. Sports used to be a unifying force for Americans, a place for perfect strangers to come together and bond over their love and support for a particular team. The Disney owned ESPN sports network has been working very hard to change that.Fear and intimidation are two of the tools the Left uses in order to make people comply with their message of unity through division. And according to one TV and radio sports host, these tactics are beginning to take hold in the NFL.Fox Sports 1 host Jason Whitlock joined Tucker Carlson Monday evening on Fox News   Tucker Carlson Tonight  to talk about the state of protesting during the National Anthem in the NFL.Whitlock understands that protesting is perfectly within players  rights as Americans, but he takes issue with the method in which people like unemployed quarterback Colin Kaepernick go about protesting. There are NFL players, black and white, who know that if you really want to address police brutality, social justice, inequality in this country, protesting the National Anthem is the perfect way for your message to get completely lost,  Whitlock told Carlson.NFL players have so many platforms on which to voice their approval or displeasure on whatever issue they re championing this week. But to use the National Anthem as the vehicle for their message only causes their message fall flat in the eyes of a lot of football fans. These  silent protests  don t make them look heroic, but rather selfish.Whitlock also posed an interesting theory to Carlson concerning players who aren t participating in these social justice protests. I want to know why NFL players aren t offering voices of dissent?  Whitlock asked. You can t tell me that there aren t NFL players who recognize the stupidity of the style of protest Colin Kaepernick has chosen,  Whitlock said.  But they re all afraid to say it because of the backlash. Another good point.We have seen sports entities like the NFL and ESPN become bastions of social justice promotion in an age where people are being divided into more groups than the  Divergent  series.

"LT GEN JOHN KELLYS INCREDIBLE SPEECH Just Days After His Own Son Was Killed In Action: Brave Men On Watch All Over the World TonightFor YOU","Just days after the death of his own son in combat, Lt Gen John Kelly eulogized two other sons in an unforgettable manner:Two years ago when I was the Commander of all U.S. and Iraqi forces, in fact, the 22nd of April 2008, two Marine infantry battalions, 1/9  The Walking Dead,  and 2/8 were switching out in Ramadi. One battalion in the closing days of their deployment going home very soon, the other just starting its seven-month combat tour.Two Marines, Corporal Jonathan Yale and Lance Corporal Jordan Haerter, 22 and 20 years old respectively, one from each battalion, were assuming the watch together at the entrance gate of an outpost that contained a makeshift barracks housing 50 Marines.The same broken down ramshackle building was also home to 100 Iraqi police, also my men and our allies in the fight against the terrorists in Ramadi, a city until recently the most dangerous city on earth and owned by Al Qaeda. Yale was a dirt poor mixed-race kid from Virginia with a wife and daughter, and a mother and sister who lived with him and he supported as well. He did this on a yearly salary of less than $23,000. Haerter, on the other hand, was a middle class white kid from Long Island.They were from two completely different worlds. Had they not joined the Marines they would never have met each other, or understood that multiple America s exist simultaneously depending on one s race, education level, economic status, and where you might have been born. But they were Marines, combat Marines, forged in the same crucible of Marine training, and because of this bond they were brothers as close, or closer, than if they were born of the same woman.The mission orders they received from the sergeant squad leader I am sure went something like:  Okay you two clowns, stand this post and let no unauthorized personnel or vehicles pass.   You clear?  I am also sure Yale and Haerter then rolled their eyes and said in unison something like:  Yes Sergeant,  with just enough attitude that made the point without saying the words,  No kidding sweetheart, we know what we re doing.  They then relieved two other Marines on watch and took up their post at the entry control point of Joint Security Station Nasser, in the Sophia section of Ramadi, al Anbar, Iraq.A few minutes later a large blue truck turned down the alley way perhaps 60-70 yards in length and sped its way through the serpentine of concrete jersey walls. The truck stopped just short of where the two were posted and detonated, killing them both catastrophically. Twenty-four brick masonry houses were damaged or destroyed. A mosque 100 yards away collapsed. The truck s engine came to rest two hundred yards away knocking most of a house down before it stopped.Our explosive experts reckoned the blast was made of 2,000 pounds of explosives. Two died, and because these two young infantrymen didn t have it in their DNA to run from danger, they saved 150 of their Iraqi and American brothers-in-arms.When I read the situation report about the incident a few hours after it happened I called the regimental commander for details as something about this struck me as different. Marines dying or being seriously wounded is commonplace in combat. We expect Marines regardless of rank or MOS to stand their ground and do their duty, and even die in the process, if that is what the mission takes. But this just seemed different.The regimental commander had just returned from the site and he agreed, but reported that there were no American witnesses to the event just Iraqi police. I figured if there was any chance of finding out what actually happened and then to decorate the two Marines to acknowledge their bravery, I d have to do it as a combat award that requires two eye-witnesses and we figured the bureaucrats back in Washington would never buy Iraqi statements. If it had any chance at all, it had to come under the signature of a general officer.I traveled to Ramadi the next day and spoke individually to a half-dozen Iraqi police all of whom told the same story. The blue truck turned down into the alley and immediately sped up as it made its way through the serpentine. They all said,  We knew immediately what was going on as soon as the two Marines began firing.  The Iraqi police then related that some of them also fired, and then to a man, ran for safety just prior to the explosion.All survived. Many were injured   some seriously. One of the Iraqis elaborated and with tears welling up said,  They d run like any normal man would to save his life. What he didn t know until then, he said, and what he learned that very instant, was that Marines are not normal. Choking past the emotion he said,  Sir, in the name of God no sane man would have stood there and done what they did. No sane man. They saved us all. What we didn t know at the time, and only learned a couple of days later after I wrote a summary and submitted both Yale and Haerter for posthumous Navy Crosses, was that one of our security cameras, damaged initially in the blast, recorded some of the suicide attack. It happened exactly as the Iraqis had described it. It took exactly six seconds from when the truck entered the alley until it detonated.You can watch the last six seconds of their young lives. Putting myself in their heads I supposed it took about a second for the two Marines to separately come to the same conclusion about what was going on once the truck came into their view at the far end of the alley. Exactly no time to talk it over, or call the sergeant to ask what they should do. Only enough time to take half an instant and think about what the sergeant told them to do only a few minutes before:     let no unauthorized personnel or vehicles pass. The two Marines had about five seconds left to live. It took maybe another two seconds for them to present their weapons, take aim, and open up. By this time the truck was half-way through the barriers and gaining speed the whole time. Here, the recording shows a number of Iraqi police, some of whom had fired their AKs, now scattering like the normal and rational men they were some running right past the Marines. They had three seconds left to live.For about two seconds more, the recording shows the Marines  weapons firing non-stop the truck s windshield exploding into shards of glass as their rounds take it apart and tore in to the body of the son-of-a-bitch who is trying to get past them to kill their brothers American and Iraqi bedded down in the barracks totally unaware of the fact that their lives at that moment depended entirely on two Marines standing their ground. If they had been aware, they would have know they were safe   because two Marines stood between them and a crazed suicide bomber.The recording shows the truck careening to a stop immediately in front of the two Marines. In all of the instantaneous violence Yale and Haerter never hesitated. By all reports and by the recording, they never stepped back. They never even started to step aside. They never even shifted their weight. With their feet spread shoulder width apart, they leaned into the danger, firing as fast as they could work their weapons. They had only one second left to live.The truck explodes. The camera goes blank. Two young men go to their God.Six seconds.Not enough time to think about their families, their country, their flag, or about their lives or their deaths, but more than enough time for two very brave young men to do their duty   into eternity. That is the kind of people who are on watch all over the world tonight for you. ",politics,"Aug 25, 2017"
"DEMOCRAT LEGAL EXPERT Shocks The Left With His Take On Statues [Video]","Legal expert and Constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley makes a case for why we need to ADD to statues and not take them down. He says we can learn more from keeping them up in direct opposition to what Democrats are saying:TURLEY RECENTLY ARGUED AGAINST THE REMOVAL OF THE GEORGE WASHINGTON STATUE: George Washington may have survived the winter at Valley Forge, but he may not see the end of the summer of Charlottesville. Bishop James Dukes of Chicago s Liberation Christian Center and others are calling for the removal of his and Andrew Jackson s statues and and stripping of their names from parks. Dukes insists that these monuments are  a slap in the face and it s a disgrace  for African Americans given their history as slave owning presidents.The bishop s call for the removal of our first president s statue is the latest effort to strip away the names of historical figures over ties to slavery or segregation. There is a movement to remove the name of Woodrow Wilson (who helped establish Princeton as a world academic institution) from buildings and schools, due to his support for segregation. The University of Virginia was founded by Thomas Jefferson, but last year, University President Teresa Sullivan was denounced by students and faculty for merely quoting our third president in a public message because he was a slave owner.The call to remove Washington s statue came less than a day after President Trump asked whether Washington would be next in the movement to remove statues like the Robert E. Lee monument in Charlottesville. The statement drew the ire of CNN s Jim Acosta who described the notion as absurd and said it was  taken as a sign that the president perhaps needs a refresher course and needs to go back to History 101.  History is precisely where this controversy should begin and end. Washington is rightfully condemned for his ownership of slaves. There were contemporaries like John Adams, John Jay, Benjamin Franklin and Alexander Hamilton who were outspoken critics of slavery. Franklin called slavery  an atrocious debasement of human nature,  while Adams referred to it as a  foul contagion in the human character.  These visionaries not only saw a great evil but answered the call of history to stand steadfastly against it.However, before Mayor Rahm Emanuel sends in the bulldozers into Washington Park, it is worth considering a few facts about our first president s history with slavery. Washington inherited a number of slaves at age 11 and received more slaves in his marriage to Martha Custis. However, he gradually came to oppose slavery. On the interim, Washington tried to assuage his guilt by refusing to sell slaves that would break up families, telling an associate that it was  against my inclination to hurt the feelings of those unhappy people by a separation of man and wife, or of families. After the war, Washington continued to discuss ways to convert his plantation from slaves to tenants at the suggestion of his close aide (and outspoken opponent of slavery) Marquis de Lafayette. By 1786, Washington wrote his friend Robert Morris,  I can only say that there is not a man living who wishes more sincerely than I do, to see a plan adopted for the abolition of [slavery]. In the end, Washington was the only one of nine slaveholding presidents (and the only slaveholding founder) who freed his slaves upon his death. Washington freed as many of his 317 slaves as possible. Some 123 slaves were his to emancipate while neither he nor Martha could free the so-called  Custis Dower slaves  (who remained property of the heirs to the estate of Daniel Parke Custis, Martha Washington s first husband). He further ordered that all of the elderly or sick slaves would be supported by his estate for the rest of their lives.So where does this leave us? With a complex and flawed figure who practiced a great evil while belatedly coming to reject it. He finished his life allied with his more enlightened colleagues but this is no reason to forgive his prior history. However, that is the point of history. It is never some neat narrative divided cleanly between demons and angels. Washington was a great leader who held a nation together through sheer leadership and stands as one of the few leaders in history to refuse to become a monarch himself.Curiously, Dukes does offer a concession. Washington Park and Jackson Park could be formally named after former Mayor Harold Washington and civil rights leader Rev. Jesse Jackson or singer Michael Jackson. It is unlikely to convince those who view these statutes as not simply reminders of past leaders but past struggles in an evolving society. The same cannot be said for Michael Jackson.  Thriller  may be the best selling album in history, but the Battle of New Orleans still has more of a hold on history.The fact is that we often learn as much from the failures as we do the triumphs of historical figures. Washington ultimately proved to be an early transitional figure in our ugly history of slavery. Washington himself described his desire at Mount Vernon  to lay a foundation  for a  rising generation  with a  new destiny  other than slavery.For my part, I am proud to teach at the George Washington University, whose charter was paid for by Washington himself as part of that same final testament. Of course, that does not mean we could not make other improvements. Another school in Washington is named after a British king, George II, who kept our nation under colonial oppression. After all, the moonwalk and robot dance steps did have a transformative impact on my generation  and  Jacksontown University  has a nice ring to it.Jonathan Turley is the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University.

Voters saying President Trump does not provide the U.S. with moral leadership, 62 to 35 percent. That he s not honest, 61 to 36 percent. Voters believe by a two to one margin that President Trump is doing more to divide the country than to unite it, 62 to 31 percent. Nearly six in 10 voters say President Trump s decisions and behavior have encouraged white supremacist groups. Now President Trump is a man who looks to numbers and to ratings.

"PELOSI JUST FLUNKED CONSTITUTIONAL LAW: You Cant Cry Wolf in a Crowded Theater [Video]","Nancy Pelosi just flunked Constitutional Law! Pelosi repeated her request that the National Park Service deny a permit to an alleged  alt-right demonstration  called Patriot Prayer. Pelosi said  not allow these elements to use a national park to spew forth their venom.  She then said that  protecting people  was the Park Service s  first responsibility. This is a trend of the left lately they claim stopping free speech, protests and removing statues have become  homeland security  issues. Jeh Johnson just commented this week that we must remove statues because they ve become a  homeland security  issue. See where this is going?

This is getting into dangerous territory but not because of what the right is doing IronicJEH JOHNSON SUDDENLY THINKS CONFEDERATE STATUES ARE A THREAT TO HOMELAND SECURITY: This is rich! The guy who opened our borders to criminals during the Obama era is now telling us that statues are a homeland security threat?  Former Obama administration official Jeh Johnson said on This Week with Martha Raditz that the removal of Confederate statues was a matter of  public safety and homeland security  on Sunday Oh brother!According to David French of National Review:Where to begin? First, It s flat-out unconstitutional for the park service to deny a permit to any group simply because public officials deem the group s speech venomous. Even if their speech is truly vile, they have the same right of access to the park as any other expressive organization.Second, while we want law enforcement to protect people, it is also required to protect liberty. Any police force that maintains security without also protecting liberty has failed in its core constitutional function.Third, the quote is wrong. She s obviously referring to Oliver Wendell Holmes s famous statement in Schenck v. United States that  The most stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theatre and causing a panic.  Fire. Wolf. Whatever.

It was a sweet family story her mother shared to inspire greatness in her daughter, to great results I might add,  said Jennifer Hanley, a spokeswoman for the campaign.In May 1953, Sir Edmund and his Sherpa guide, Tenzing Norgay, became the first men to reach the summit of Mount Everest. In 1995, shortly after meeting Sir Edmund, Mrs. Clinton said that her mother, Dorothy Rodham, had long told her she was named for the famous mountaineer.

"AMERICAN-MADE CONFEDERATE FLAG FACTORY Sees A Huge Change In Sales After Charlottesville","You d think people would be afraid to order a Confederate flag after the riot in Charlottesville BUT this Alabama flag factory is seeing a huge jump in sales The story of how this single flag manufacturer was started and has flourished is bittersweet ALABAMA FLAG & BANNER SALES SURGE!Sales of Confederate flags surged at Alabama Flag & Banner, which may be the only company still manufacturing the flags in the United States. Belinda Kennedy, the owner, sees the flag as a historical symbol.Rebel flag sales are up since Charlottesville. One north Alabama shop may be the only flag manufacturer in America meeting the increased demand.Alabama Flag & Banner is located in a small strip near downtown Huntsville. Two years ago, the company began manufacturing the Confederate flag after retailers pulled it from their shelves in the wake of the mass shooting at the Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston, S.C. in which nine people were killed by a white supremacist who d been photographed holding a Confederate flag.The country s major flag manufacturers stopped producing rebel flags. Eventually, said longtime owner Belinda Kennedy, Alabama Flag & Banner became the go-to manufacturer for hundreds of retailers across the country looking to stock American-made Confederate flags. Online orders boomed, too.Two weeks ago, after the deadly Charlottesville rally sparked a national debate about whether Confederate monuments should be removed from parks around the country, flag sales spiked again. After the church shooting (in 2015), Amazon and Walmart stopped selling (the flag) and people were afraid they wouldn t be able to buy it,  she said.  And then you started seeing streets renamed, schools being renamed, mountains being renamed. And then people started getting angry. And then there s another surge (in sales). Since 2015, Alabama Flag & Banner has sold an average of 600-800 Confederate flags a year. Before that, they typically made a handful of special orders per year because they were able to order flags from a larger manufacturer.Kennedy said there are now Chinese-made flags available elsewhere, and she s seen a handful of individuals online who hand-sew flags to order, but as far as she knows her business is the only one in the country currently manufacturing Confederate flags.About half of the Confederate flags at her shop are a more labor-intensive appliqued flag which retails for anywhere from $93 to upwards of $200. The rest are a less expensive screen-printed flag, which costs $38.50 for a 3  x 5  flag. Everybody s got a different reason (for buying),  she said.  By and large, I think people are afraid they may not be able to get it one day. Confederate flags represent only a fraction of her business, she said, and she has not needed to hire any extra help so far. She has a team of seven or eight seamstresses, some of them Hispanic, who work on the manufacturing side, hand-stitching appliqued flags and preparing the screen-printed flags.Downstairs in Kennedy s office is a double-frame picture of two of her great-great-grandfathers, who fought for the South in the Civil War. I think there is a bigger racial divide in our country than what we ve had in many years,  said Kennedy.  I think a lot of it is (because) we re trying to sanitize history. You ve got white supremacists, but then you ve got people like me who are history buffs, pushing back and saying, don t change history. Removing Confederate monuments is not right, she said. She echoed President Donald Trump s remarks about the Charlottesville violence, asking where the country should draw the line at removing monuments because founding fathers like George Washington and Thomas Jefferson owned slaves.The Confederate flag, in her view, has been co-opted for something it doesn t represent. She hated seeing it carried by white supremacists in Charlottesville. When you ve got people like the Ku Klux Klan and these neo-Nazi groups, the white supremacists, when they hijack the flag, that should be a crime,  she said,  because that s not what the flag is about. But that s what makes people so vehemently, adamantly opposed to the flag. Since 2015, Kennedy has been no stranger to attention, though she said she dislikes most of the publicity and news coverage surrounding the Confederate flag. Outlets such as CNN and Yahoo News have already interviewed Kennedy this week as part of coverage of the monument debate.A self-avowed Daughter of the Confederacy, Kennedy does not see herself as a crusader for the Confederate cause. But she doesn t accept that the flag   or monuments, for that matter   are anything more than a symbol of heritage or history. When we start trying to rewrite our history, we are forgetting our history,  she said.  Does anybody really think by taking down monuments and renaming mountains and taking down Confederate flags, that we are really going to see racism end? That s not going to fix it.Read more: AL.com",politics,"Aug 23, 2017"

"DIRTY JOBS HOST MIKE ROWE Absolutely Destroys Guy Who Called Him A White Nationalist"," Dirty Jobs  host Mike Rowe went off on a guy who claimed Rowe is a  white nationalist . The usual happy-go-lucky Rowe was clearly ticked when he wrote back to Chuck Adkins.Chuck Adkins asked Rowe:  One of the tenants of white nationalism is that college educated people are academic elitists. Comment? No? I m not surprised. You never take a political stand because you don t want to alienate anybody. Its bad for business. I get it. But there is a current of anti intellectualism in this country   promoted by Republicans. Those people love you, and they think your initiative is their initiative. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is kickin our ass academically. Rowe responded with a blistering rebuke of Adkins and the liberal media: Since we re being candid, allow me to say how much I dislike your post. Everything about it annoys me   your smug and snarky tone, your appalling grammar, your complete lack of evidence to support your claims, and of course, the overarching logical fallacy that informs your entire position,  Rowe wrote.  What really bugs me though, is the fact that you re not entirely wrong. It s true; I haven t shared any political opinions this week, in part anyway, because doing so might very well be  bad for business. What can I say? I work for half-a-dozen different companies, none of whom pay me to share my political opinions. I run a non-partisan foundation, I m about to launch a new show on Facebook, and I m very aware that celebrities pay a price for opening their big fat gobs. Gilbert Gottfried, Kathy Griffin, Colin Kaepernick, Milo Yiannopoulos even that guy from Google who just got himself fired for mouthing off. There s no getting around it   the first amendment does not guarantee the freedom to speak without consequences. And really, that s fine by me,  he continued. So no   I m not going to share my personal feelings about Charlottesville, President Trump, or the current effort to remove thousands of statues of long dead soldiers from the public square. Not just because it s  bad for business,  but because it s annoying. I can t think of a single celebrity whose political opinion I value, and I m not going to assume the country feels any differently about mine,  Rowe wrote.  So, rather than blow myself up, or chime in with all the obvious observations about the cowardly scum in the pointy hats, I m going to talk instead about my belief that comments like yours pose a far greater threat to the future of our country than the existence of a memorial to Thomas Jefferson, or a monument to George Washington. Ready? Then Rowe started in on Adkins  insinuations. You say that White Nationalists believe that everyone who goes to college is an  academic elite.  You then say that Republicans promote  anti-intellectualism.  You offer no proof to support either claim, but it really doesn t matter   your statements successfully connect two radically different organizations by alleging a shared belief,  Rowe said.  Thus, White Nationalists and The Republican Party suddenly have something in common   a contempt for higher education. Then, you make it personal. You say that Republicans  love  me because they believe that my initiative and  their  initiative are one and the same. But of course,  their  initiative is now the same initiative as White Nationalists. He continued  Very clever. Without offering a shred of evidence, you ve implied that Republicans who support mikeroweWORKS do so because they believe I share their disdain for all things  intellectual.  And poof   just like that, Republicans, White Nationalists, and mikeroweWORKS are suddenly conflated, and the next thing you know, I m off on a press tour to disavow rumors of my troubling association with the Nazis! Far-fetched? Far from it,  Rowe continued.  That s how logical fallacies work. A flaw in reasoning or a mistaken belief undermines the logic of a conclusion, often leading to real-world consequences. And right now, logical fallacies are not limited to the warped beliefs of morons with tiki torches, and other morons calling for  more dead cops.  Logical fallacies are everywhere. Not near done, Rowe wrote,  As I type this, a Democrat on CNN is making an argument that says,  because Thomas Jefferson owned slaves, those Republicans now opposed to tearing down his memorial are  pro-slavery,  and therefore aligned with the modern day KKK.  That s a logical fallacy. Over on Fox, a Republican is arguing that  any Democrat who has not yet condemned the Senator from Missouri for publicly wishing that Donald Trump be assassinated, is guilty of wishing for the exact same thing.  That s a logical fallacy. Yesterday, on The Science Channel, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, a noted astronomer, tweeted that the ability of scientists to accurately predict the solar eclipse, was proof that predictions of global warming were also accurate. That s a logical fallacy. Then Rowe turned the tables on his accuser, continuing,  Want to hear another one? Imagine something like this, unfolding over on MSNBC. Good Evening, America, our top story tonight  Chuck Atkins is a racist! Why? Because he can t spell. Just look at his grammar! In a recent post on Mike Rowe s Facebook page, Mr. Atkins, while bemoaning America s global academic standing, not only misspelled  elitist,  he used  tenants  when he meant  tenets.  He neglected to use a hyphen in  anti-intellectual,  and he misplaced several commas and apostrophes! But why is he a racist, you ask? Simple. Because everyone knows racists are ignorant. Chuck Atkins is clearly a poor speller. Poor spelling and grammar are signs of ignorance. Ergo   Chuck Atkins is a racist! Boom! The matter is settled! There s not much we can do about the news, but here on Facebook, I think we can do better. This isn t Twitter,  Rowe said.  We re not limited to a few inflammatory sentences and a flurry of emojis. Take a moment, Chuck. Think. Make a rational argument. Otherwise, just link us to a cat video. People love those, and they re almost never  bad for business.  (Unless of course, the cat gets hurt. People hate that.) Just don t assume that people will care about your beliefs, if you re not willing to back them up with some relevant facts and a rational conclusion. Here, for instance, are a few facts that matter to me, with respect to my foundation and the recurring charge of  fostering anti-intellectualism. Rowe then defended his charitable work, writing,  mikeroweWORKS is a PR campaign for the skilled trades. For the last nine years, we ve partnered with numerous trade schools, raised millions of dollars for work-ethic scholarships, and called attention to millions of jobs that don t require a four-year degree. But that doesn t mean we re  anti-intellectual.  We re not even  anti-college.  We simply reject the popular notion that a four-year degree is the best path for the most people. And we re hardly alone. Millions of reasonable people   Republicans and Democrats alike   are worried that our universities are doing a poor job of preparing students for the real world. They re worried about activist professors, safe spaces, the rising cost of tuition, a growing contempt for history, and a simmering disregard of the first amendment. These people are concerned that our universities   once beacons of free speech   now pander to a relatively small percentage of students who can t tolerate any political opinion that challenges their own. And they re concerned   deeply concerned   that millions of good jobs are currently vacant that don t require a four-year degree, or any of the catastrophic debt that comes with it. Returning to the original attack, Rowe concluded,  Again   these are not the concerns of  anti-intellectuals.  They are the concerns of people who care about the future of the country. I don t know how many of these people are Republicans, but I can assure you that no one who actually supports my initiative is remotely confused about my feelings on education, because I ve been crystal clear on that topic from the very beginning. To quote Thomas Jefferson, (while I still can,)  If a nation expects to be ignorant and free and live in a state of civilization, it expects what never was and never will be.  On this point, my foundation does not equivocate. In other words, Chuck, I have no idea what The White Nationalists think about my efforts, or the Republicans, the Democrats, the elitists, the Italians, the Presbyterians, the unions, or the self-proclaimed anti-intellectuals. And really, I couldn t care less. My question is, why do you? Mike PS. Ok, I ve just re-read this, (in a desperate search for typos,) and I want to apologize for pointing out that you re a lousy speller. This is probably not the time to trot out The Grammar Nazi, but your tenor and tone pissed me off, and I responded in my own snarky way. Sorry,  he wrote. PPS Maybe this is how political correctness begins? Maybe we start by correcting each other s grammar, and then move on to the business of correcting everything else? Today a missing hyphen, tomorrow a missing monument. Or, maybe not,  he concluded.",politics,"Aug 23, 2017"

What about serial creeper Joe Biden, who you just can t seem to get enough of?From the Trump-hating The Hill: Hillary Clinton writes in her new book that Donald Trump s attempts to  intimidate  her during the presidential debates made her  skin crawl  and that she wanted to tell him to  back up, you creep. What would you do? Do you stay calm, keep smiling and carry on as if he weren t repeatedly invading your space?  the 2016 Democratic nominee asks in her new book,  What Happened,  excerpts of which were released by MSNBC s  Morning Joe  early Wednesday. Or do you turn, look him in the eye and say loudly and clearly  Back up, you creep. Get away from me. I know you love to intimidate women, but you can t intimidate me, so back up.

Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) Flake wouldn t rank this high in a normal election year, but a Republican president threatening to support a primary challenge to an incumbent GOP senator isn t normal, either.Sen.

So how does Tuckman know for certain that the bottles the  non-violent  group he is so quick to defend, were only filled with water? And since when is lobbing ANYTHING at police officers who are protecting our president and his supporters considered NON-violent?Earlier in the evening, another CNN reporter nearly got hit by the lit end of a smoke grenade.CNN may want to rethink this whole bunkering with Antifa thing during what appears to be ongoing, violent protests by the Democrat Partys  Soros funded Alt-Left groups.The Alt-Left came prepared last night, as they were seen proudly displaying their AR-15 s.",politics,"Aug 23, 2017"

They worried that Hillary might actually be our next president. We warned people to ignore the polls and to ignore the leftist media. We told them the Democrat Party media was only trying to create the illusion that most Americans wouldn t vote for Donald J. Trump to demoralize his base. We implored voters to pay attention to the size of the crowds showing up for his rallies. We explained to them that the reason violent protests were breaking out at his rallies was because they were trying to distract from the truth about the massive numbers of Americans who were showing up to support candidate Trump.Nothing much has changed since the election, except for the level of vitriol and hate by Democrats who were blindsided by the media who promised them Hillary would win. Meanwhile, throngs of people are still showing up to attend President Trump s rallies. His supporters vehemently defend him on social media, and if their brave enough, his supporters may even admit to their friends or co-workers that they admire him for keeping his promises to them.It s been 7 months since President Trump s inauguration and the media is still up to their same dirty tricks.

"WATCH: SMARTPHONE CAPTURES NEW BOATLOAD OF Scared, Hungry Women and Children On Their Way To Europe&While 6.6 MILLION More Are Waiting To Cross","Ask your liberal friends to tell you more about these  poor women and children  who are fleeing persecution from radical Islamists in the Middle East The recent surge of migration into Europe has been unprecedented in scope, with an estimated 1 million migrants from the Middle East and North Africa this past year alone, making for a massive humanitarian crisis, as well as a political and moral dilemma for European governments. But one crucial dimension of this crisis has gone little-noticed: sex or, more technically, sex ratios.According to official counts, a disproportionate number of these migrants are young, unmarried, unaccompanied males. In fact, the sex ratios among migrants are so one-sided we re talking worse than those in China, in some cases that they could radically change the gender balance in European countries in certain age cohorts.  PoliticoA leaked German government report has warned, that up to 6.6 million people are waiting in countries around the Mediterranean to cross into Europe, according to details of the classified report leaked to Bild newspaper.Here s a video that s being circulated on social media today, of a boatload of young, male immigrants who are speaking Arabic as they record their trip on a smartphone. Note to bleeding heart liberals: These are clearly not impoverished men or women and children who are escaping persecution by Islamic extremists.New boatload of scared/hungry women and children on their way to Europe. At least they had their smart phone to document the journey. pic.twitter.com/svLUy6mO9K  Based Monitored   (@BasedMonitored) August 22, 2017The high percentage of young males flooding European countries will soon be a very serious problem:Politico   As many governments, including in the United States, debate how many migrants to accept onto their shores, they would be wise to take gender balance into consideration. That might sound sexist on the surface, but years of research has shown that male-dominated societies are less stable, because they are more susceptible to higher levels of violence, insurgence and mistreatment of women. In Germany, scores of women recently reported being attacked on New Year s Eve by men whom the authorities describe as of  North African or Arabic  descent. While it is not yet known whether the alleged perpetrators were migrants, the attacks may finally be alerting policymakers to the risks of a male-dominated migration wave.Why would European societies, many of which rank highest on global measures of gender equality and stability and peace, jeopardize those hard-won and enviable rankings?That imbalance might not sound radical, but it is, especially when you look more closely at who those males are. It s true that many male migrants hope that, if granted asylum, they will be joined in Europe by their wives and children, who would help balance out national sex ratios. But importantly, more than 20 percent of migrants are minors below the age of 18, and the IOM estimates that more than half of those minors traveling to Europe are traveling as unaccompanied minors 90 percent of whom are males. This heavily male subset is all but guaranteed asylum because of their status as unaccompanied minors, but they get no special dispensation to bring spouses, especially since the European Court of Human Rights recently ruled that European Union countries are not required to recognize the legality of child marriages among migrants.

And oh yeah your kids teacher will also inform your child that the gender they re born with doesn t matter, and that they can actually choose the gender they identify with.  Because liberal educators know better than you what s best for your child.The Rocklin Academy school board is facing tough questions from parents concerned over a controversial incident involving transgender discussions inside a kindergarten class. These parents feel betrayed by the school district that they were not notified,  said Karen England with the Capitol Resource Institute.WATCH:The incident happened earlier this summer during the last few days of the academic school year.At Monday night s board meeting, the teacher at the center of the controversy spoke out. With emotions high, she addressed a packed house. I m so proud of my students, it was never my intent to harm any students but to help them through a difficult situation,  she said.The teacher defended her actions to read two children s books about transgenderism including one titled  I am Jazz.  She says the books were given to her by a transgender child going through a transition. The kindergartners came home very confused, about whether or not you can pick your gender, whether or not they really were a boy or a girl,  said England.And many parents say they feel betrayed and blindsided. I want her to hear from me as a parent what her gender identity means to her and our family, not from a book that may be controversial,  a parent said. My daughter came home crying and shaking so afraid she could turn into a boy,  another parent said.The issue was not on the agenda, so parents spoke out during public comment. It s really about the parents being informed and involved and giving us the choice and rights of what s being introduced to our kids, and at what age,  said parent Chelsea McQuistan.Many teachers also spoke out in support of what transpired inside the classroom. They spoke about the importance of teaching students about diversity and having healthy dialogues.Unlike sex education, the topics of gender identity don t require prior parental notice.

Antifa is the worst with their tactics of extreme violence and destruction.Just as destructive as the violence is the left s effort to hijack the narrative anytime something happens between both sides. It s an Alinsky tactic that the left has been using long before President Trump came on the scene. The only difference now is that they re on overdrive with the attacks on Trump! It s downright scary!Take the The Huffington Post s recent article calling for the execution of Trump and  everyone assisting his agenda. If you ve noticed a hijacking of the narrative on just about everything to do with President Trump then look no further than the attack on his comments yesterday.

"CHAOS AND MOB RULE at Charlottesville City Council Meeting: Thats not the rules! [Video]","This is mob rule AGAIN! The best part of this video is when Mayor Mike Signer says  that s not the rules He must not have been watching the news lately. The rules don t apply to these kooks.This is like a bunch of toddlers who are warned over and over to stop misbehaving. Is this what America wants? We hope people on all sides see how horrible this is!It s hard to feel sorry for the mayor and city council when they supported this mayhem. The real culprit in all this is their governor. Perhaps they should go visit him to ask questions about what he did to turn the rally/ protest into a violent riot.OUR LATEST ON THE VIRGINIA GOVERNOR: Why did the Democrat VA Governor throw gasoline on the fire after violent protests broke out in Charlottesville? Why did the radical Democrat governor of Virginia LIE about weapons being stashed around the city of Charlottesville prior to the march? Was he just doing his part as a prominent member of the Democrat Party to help create more racial division in America? Why did he lie about Virginia police officers being underprepared for the violence and chaos that took place, when police officers claim they were completely prepared? Was he trying to shine a negative light on the police force assigned to Charlottesville, as part of the Democrat Party s ongoing plan to undermine the credibility of our law enforcement?Last week, Virginia police officers were speaking out, and setting  the record straight. They were not about to remain silent while their governor made up stories to boost his party s race dividing, cop-hating narrative.Republican Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas is not just sitting around and wondering how the Clinton bestie was able to get away with lying about what happened in Charlottesville, while the media ignored Governor McAuliffe s part in inciting violence.Sunday on Fox News Channel s  Fox & Friends Weekend,  Gohmert called for a Department of Justice investigation of Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D-VA) and Charlottesville, VA Mayor Michael Signer for possibly facilitating the violence that took place in Charlottesville earlier this month.Gohmert said,  The way forward s not gonna be easy. And I think the Justice Department needs a full investigation of the governor, of the mayor. They said in court there would be violence at Charlottesville, and then the witnesses and the photographs show they herded these groups to create violence so they could brag. We need a Justice Department investigation into Kessler. You don t just go all of a sudden from having multiracial roommates and a Jewish girlfriend to all of a sudden being a white supremacist that wants to join the Republican party. There s something very, very wrong in all of this. He added,  Like they were the violence at Trump events, they may have been behind this violence getting started.

"ALT-LEFT PLANS TO HIJACK PRESIDENT TRUMPS AZ RALLY&Will He Really Make Them Crazy By Announcing Pardon For Americas Toughest Sheriff on Illegal Immigration?","The pieces are in place ahead of President Donald Trump s rally in downtown Phoenix on Tuesday, with the nation waiting to see how it will play out.Officials are bracing for a deluge of tens of thousands of supporters and protesters, leading law enforcement to close roads and also for many businesses, offices, schools and even state courts to close their doors early.Although Trump visited Arizona seven times during his campaign, this is his first visit as president and likely to be a very different affair.  AZ CentralOn August 14, President Trump on Tuesday retweeted a Fox News story saying he was  seriously considering  pardoning former Arizona sheriff Joe Arpaio.FOX NEWS EXCLUSIVE: President Trump 'seriously considering' a pardon for ex-Sheriff Joe Arpaio https://t.co/Rgw8l7i9Xl  FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) August 14, 2017President Trump may soon issue a pardon for Joe Arpaio, the colorful former Arizona sheriff who was found guilty two weeks ago of criminal contempt for defying a state judge s order to stop traffic patrols targeting suspected undocumented immigrants. In his final years as Maricopa County sheriff, Arpaio had emerged as a leading opponent of illegal immigration. I am seriously considering a pardon for Sheriff Arpaio,  the president said Sunday, during a conversation with Fox News at his club in Bedminster, N.J.  He has done a lot in the fight against illegal immigration. He s a great American patriot and I hate to see what has happened to him. Trump said the pardon could happen in the next few days, should he decide to do so.Arpaio, 85, was convicted by U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton of misdemeanor contempt of court for willfully disregarding an Arizona judge s order in 2011 to stop the anti-immigrant traffic patrols. Arpaio had maintained the law enforcement patrols for 17 months thereafter.The man who built a controversial national reputation as  America s toughest sheriff  admitted he prolonged his patrols, but insisted he did not intend to break the law because one of his former attorneys did not explain to him the full measure of restrictions contained in the court order.He is expected to be sentenced on Oct. 5 and could face up to six months in jail. However, since he is 85 years old and has no prior convictions, some attorneys doubt he will receive any jail time.Citing his long service as  an outstanding sheriff,  the president said Arpaio is admired by many Arizona citizens who respected his tough-on-crime approach.Arpaio s widely publicized tactics included forcing inmates to wear pink underwear and housing them in desert tent camps where temperatures often climbed well past 100 degrees Fahrenheit. He also controversially brought back chain gains, including a voluntary chain gang for women prisoners.  FOX News ",politics,"Aug 22, 2017"

The Forgotten Man painting is amazing in its symbolism.Here s how McNaughton describes the painting:Against the background of a darkening sky, all of the past Presidents of the United States gather before the White House, as if to commemorate some great event. In the left hand corner of the painting sits a man. That man, with his head bowed appears distraught and hopeless as he contemplates his future. Some of the past Presidents try to console him while looking in the direction of the modern Presidents as if to say,  What have you done?  Many of these modern Presidents, seemingly oblivious to anything other than themselves, appear to be congratulating each other on their great accomplishments. In front of the man, paper trash is blowing in the wind.

"MUSLIM PROFESSOR A NO-SHOW AT LECTURE: Afraid to be Called Out Again On Teaching Sharia Practice of Cutting off Hands is Good [Video]","Recall that in 2016 a Muslim professor was caught on video [see below] explaining why cutting off hands as punishment for theft is a good punishment. Bassam Alhalabi believes in Sharia law and was explaining why it s such a great idea and that it would cut down on crime. Here s the video below:JUST TO BE CLEAR   THIS MAN BELIEVES IT S OK TO CHOP OFF HANDS!  Where there is no Sharia, Islamic Sharia, they die in dozens and hundreds every day because of organized crime. People kill people, other people or steal pizza for $10 and so   so when Islamic Shariah is saying about capital punishment   so even though it sounds like it is severe but if that is the solution to prevent any crimes, then it still has a lot of rules and regulations. I will just mention one and stop here, which is let s say cutting off the hands of a person if they steal. It sounds very severe. It sounds very barbaric, I know. But if takes one or two people to have their hands cut off, and then there s no more stealing and there s no more stealing in the whole nation   that s a much better resolution than having hundreds of people die every day. RUN AWAY, RUN AWAY! THE PROFESSOR HIGHTAILED IT OUT OF THERE WHEN HE SAW UNITED WEST THERE TO RECORD HIM AGAIN!On August 17, 2017 Florida Atlantic University (FAU) Professor and President of the Islamic Society of Boca Raton, FL, Bassem Alhalabi, agreed to publicly defend the Shariah Islamiyya (Islamic Law) but ran away in shame from the venue minutes before the programs starting time.The title of the meeting was,  Interfaith Cafe: Sharia Law and U.S. Law Nothing To Fear.  Dr. Alhalabi was to defend Islamic law, making the case that we non-Muslims have nothing to fear from Shariah.Deep down Dr. Alhalabi knows the facts are not on his side. I suspect what Dr. Alhalabi fears most are Americans who are educated on Islamic Law and use Islamic sources with consensus/Ijma to distinguish his lies from truth.When those knowledgeable people from The United West showed up to film, Dr. Alhalabi ran out of the venue faster than you can say chop chop adios. Dr. Alhalabi left his audience and event organizers dumbfounded. We suspect the fear that he d be caught on video again might be the reason why.Via: Dr. Rich Swier",politics,"Aug 21, 2017"
"WOW! SECRET SERVICE DIRECTOR Sets Record Straight, After USA TODAY Attempts To Make Readers Believe President Trump Is Draining Secret Service Funds Dry","USA Today published an article today that was so egregiously misleading that every hotel that leaves this joke of a publication outside the doors for their guests to read, should be ashamed to be peddling such trash. (Even if it is free..and we all know what they say:  If it s free It s  free  for a reason .) USA Today is one of the most virulently anti-Trump publications you will find anywhere. Much like the morning shows, whose morning talk hosts greet their viewers with cheerful dispositions and big white smiles, while sticking daggers into our president and his family, USA Today can be found as in almost every hotel in America as a complimentary source of news for their guests.USA Today comes across to the everyday American as a friendly publication that gives Americans a snapshot into the latest national news without any bias. Unfortunately, nothing could be further than the truth. USA Today s stories are so anti-Trump, they should almost come with a warning label for anyone who s looking for honest journalism and unbiased news.An article that appeared today, in the USA Today talked about the dire financial situation that President Trump and his family have caused with their  with an unprecedented number of White House protectees. Shortly after the article was published, Secret Service Director Randolph  Tex  Alles released a statement refuting what USA Today claimed he said. The quotes in red in the USA Today article below are from the Secret Service Director s statement.USA Today   The Secret Service can no longer pay hundreds of agents it needs to carry out an expanded protective mission   in large part due to the sheer size of President Trump s family and efforts necessary to secure their multiple residences up and down the East Coast.Here s what Secret Service Director Randolph  Tex  Alles said about the Secret Service running out of money: The Secret Service has the funding it needs to meet all current mission requirements for the remainder of the fiscal year and compensate employees for overtime within statutory pay caps. Secret Service Director Randolph  Tex  Alles, in an interview with USA TODAY, said more than 1,000 agents have already hit the federally mandated caps for salary and overtime allowances that were meant to last the entire year.OOPS! It looks like the same thing happened in 2016 while  Barack Obama was President: The Secret Service estimates that roughly 1,100 employees will work overtime hours in excess of statutory pay caps during calendar year 2017. Our agency experienced a similar situation in calendar year 2016 that resulted in legislation that allowed Secret Service employees to exceed statutory caps on pay.The agency has faced a crushing workload since the height of the contentious election season, and it has not relented in the first seven months of the administration. Agents must protect Trump   who has traveled almost every weekend to his properties in Florida, New Jersey and Virginia   and his adult children whose business trips and vacations have taken them across the country and overseas.To remedy this ongoing and serious problem, the agency has worked closely with the Department of Homeland Security, the Administration, and the Congress over the past several months to find a legislative solution. As we work to ensure that employees are compensated for the hours they work, the Secret Service continues its rigorous hiring of special agents, Uniformed Division officers, and critical support staff to meet future mission requirements. The president has a large family, and our responsibility is required in law,  Alles said.  I can t change that. I have no flexibility. The law, Title 18 US Code 3056, details protection requirements for the President, Vice President and their immediate family members.Alles said the service is grappling with an unprecedented number of White House protectees. Under Trump, 42 people have protection, a number that includes 18 members of his family. That s up from 31 during the Obama administration.Does USA Today really believe the average American is so stupid that they ve already forgotten about the several separate vacations that the former first lady took while her husband golfed almost every weekend that he was in office? What about her notorious trip to Spain where she brought most of her entire  friends and family list  courtesy of the American taxpayers?The people you see surrounding former First Lady Michele Obama on her luxury African Safari are Michelle s family members. Yes, the American taxpayer paid for her luxury African Safari with her brother, cousins and of course, her mother, who lived in the White House for Barack s entire 8-year term, and traveled to all of their overseas destinations courtesy of, you guessed it, the American taxpayer.Surely USA Today doesn t believe we ve already forgotten about Barack Obama s obsession with golf, that more than one time, took him and his lovely wife to opposite sides of the country to satisfy their individual 5-star travel needs:Overwork and constant travel have also been driving a recent exodus from the Secret Service ranks, yet without congressional intervention to provide additional funding, Alles will not even be able to pay agents for the work they have already done.The compensation crunch is so serious that the director has begun discussions with key lawmakers to raise the combined salary and overtime cap for agents, from $160,000 per year to $187,000 for at least the duration of Trump s first term.But even if such a proposal was approved, about 130 veteran agents would not be fully compensated for hundreds of hours already amassed, according to the agency. And finally, the same Secret Service Director Randolph  Tex  Alles who allegedly gave USA Today the  exclusive  scoop about how the Trump family were draining the Secret Service funds dry, concluded his statement with this:This issue is not one that can be attributed to the current Administration s protection requirements alone, but rather has been an ongoing issue for nearly a decade due to an overall increase in operational tempo.This isn t the first time USA Today was caught fabricating a story to make President Trump look bad to their readers. In April of 2017, USA TODAY was caught fabricating a story about an innocent  Dreamer  being deported. Click HERE to read the story.",politics,"Aug 21, 2017"

To see a total eclipse, where the moon fully covers the sun for a short few minutes, you must be in the path of totality. The path of totality is a relatively thin ribbon, around 70 miles wide, that will cross the U.S. from West to East. The first point of contact will be at Lincoln Beach, Oregon at 9:05 a.m. PDT. Totality begins there at 10:16 a.m. PDT. Over the next hour and a half, it will cross through Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and North and South Carolina. The total eclipse will end near Charleston, South Carolina at 2:48 p.m. EDT. From there the lunar shadow leaves the United States at 4:09 EDT.

If there is, then we refer it to the U.S. Attorney. Our primary goal is to determine if there is intent and meaning behind it,  Schmidt said.According to a screenshot of the now-deleted conversation obtained by the Post-Dispatch, another commenter named Christopher Gagn  was writing about a cousin of his who he said was on Trump s Secret Service detail.Here is a screen shot of the post that Chappelle-Nadal deleted after she was outed on social media:After Chappelle-Nadal was criticized by thousands of Americans, she still refused to back down and told the media she would not apologize to President Trump for the heinous remarks she made.After some members (not all) of the Democrat Party suggested she should step down from her position as state senator, Maria Chappelle-Nadal suddenly had a change of heart.

"LEFTY MEDIA Uses #SolarEclipse To Make Case For Why They Still Believe Clinton Won&Still Not Over The Election?","Oh my! The lefty Boston Globe is using the 2017 Solar Eclipse to make a case for a Clinton presidential win. The over-the-top article goes out of its way to make the claim that Trump lost to Clinton It s delusional and twisted that the Globe would use an article about the eclipse to continue down this path of delusion The Globe asked: : Is the eclipse throwing shade at Clinton supporters?The path of ideal viewing spots for this month s highly-anticipated total solar eclipse cuts overwhelmingly through places that voted for President Trump in November.IT STARTS OUT NICE ENOUGH TO TRUMP BUT THEN IT S  WHAM! THEY PIVOT TO MAKE THE CASE FOR HOW THEY SILL BELIEVE CLINTON WON IN 2016!And about 92 percent of those counties swung in Trump s favor, while fewer than two dozen counties voted for his opponent, Hillary Clinton.Trump won many of those counties by a wide margin, securing an average of 71 percent of the vote in counties he won along the path. Clinton, by comparison, got only about 56 percent of the vote in counties she won along the eclipse path.And of the more than 6.2 million votes cast in those counties for one of those two candidates, 59 percent were for Trump, while 41 percent were for Clinton.That stands in stark contrast to the overall results of the 2016 election, in which about 51 percent of votes cast for either candidate went to Clinton, while about 49 percent went to Trump.The eclipse on Aug. 21 will be visible to people across the United States, but in most areas, the view will be of a partial eclipse. People will only be able to see a total eclipse if they re located along the  path of totality,  which will start near Lincoln City, Ore., and end near Charleston, S.C.Still, it s not entirely surprising that the eclipse s path of best perspective could slice through the entire country while mostly avoiding areas that backed Clinton.WHAM! THE CASE IS MADE FOR WHY THEY STILL BELIEVE CLINTON WON! While she won the popular vote, Trump won the Electoral College and about 84 percent of the country s 3,100-plus counties.Clinton won more voters overall because she captured densely populated urban areas, including New York City, Los Angeles, and Boston. Trump, by contrast, won many rural areas with small populations.FUN FACT OF THE DAY Perhaps it s not a surprise that the solar eclipse is passing over Trump strongholds given that the president himself was born during a lunar eclipse.On June 14, 1946, the day Trump was born, there was a total lunar eclipse, though it wasn t visible from the United States, NASA records show. Instead, it could be seen from parts of South America, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia.THE LIBERAL MEDIA IS STILL FIGHTING THE FIGHT WE CAN T WAIT UNTIL TRUMP2020!WE JUST WANT TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT:Overall Trump won approximately 2,600 counties to Clinton s 500, or about 84% of the geographic United States. However, Clinton won 88 of of the 100 largest counties (including Washington D.C.). Without these 100 largest counties she would have lost by 11.5 million votes.TRUMP=RED    CLINTON=BLUEVIA: WKI",politics,"Aug 21, 2017"

"DISGUSTING! UNEMPLOYED, RACE-OBSESSED Colin Kaepernick Will Be Added To Smithsonian Black History Museum, While Conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas Is BLACKLISTED","Few people, if any, keep track of ratings or public approval numbers for the Smithsonian. However, if they did, those numbers would soon go down dramatically. Why? Because the man who single-handedly accomplished the nearly impossible feat of turning America against its favorite game, is about to get his own exhibit.Most fans were not impressed with Kaepernick s disrespect of our American flag and of our national anthem. According to curators at the museum, currently unemployed NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick is about to get his own display at the Smithsonian s National Museum of African American History and Culture on the National Mall.In fact, museum officials have already begun requesting various items of significance from Kaepernick s protests of last year.According to the Washington Examiner,  Artifacts from former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick s national anthem protests will reportedly soon be on display at the Black Lives Matter collection at the Smithsonian s National Museum of African American History. The National Museum of African American History and Culture has nearly 40,000 items in our collection,  said Damion Thomas, the museum s sports curator, to USA Today.  The Colin Kaepernick collection is in line with the museum s larger collecting efforts to document the varied areas of society that have been impacted by the Black Lives Matter movement. Incredibly, as pointed out by IJR and The Washington Times, the museum extends Kaepernick this honor while only mentioning African-American Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, in connection with the sexual harassment charge brought against him by Anita Hill.  BrietbartI was opposed to welfare because I had seen its destructive effects up close in Savannah. Most of the older people among whom I had grown up felt as I did, sharing Daddy s belief that it would be the  ruination  of blacks, undermining their desire to wor & provide for themselves. I added that my own sister was a victim of the system, which had created a sense of entitlement that had trapped her and her children. I went on to say that I opposed busing, preferring to give school vouchers to poor children. Source: My Grandfather s Son: A Memoir by Clarence Thomas, p. 132-3 , Oct 1, 2007Quotes like the one above from Clarence Thomas have made him a target of the left. It really doesn t matter what color you are, if you don t tow the entitlement line that keeps you in the good graces of the Democrat Party, you will be punished. In Clarence Thomas  case, the punishment is that he will likely never see himself featured in the Smithsonian Black History museum.Here is a short biography of Clarence Thomas, that illustrates the unimaginable odds he overcame  to become a US Supreme Court Justice:Clarence Thomas was born in the tiny coastal town of Pin Point, Georgia, on June 23, 1948. As a very young boy he lived in a one-room shack with dirt floors and no plumbing. When Thomas was two years old, his father walked out on the family. As a result, at the age of seven he and his younger brother were sent to live with their grandfather, Myers Anderson, and his wife in Savannah, Georgia. Anderson, a devout Catholic and active member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), sent Thomas to a Catholic school staffed by nuns.In remarks reported by Jet magazine, Thomas has said that he grew up speaking Gullah, a creole dialect spoken by African Americans on the coastal islands of the southeastern United States. Unlike other Supreme Court justices, he rarely asks questions from the bench during court proceedings. He has said that he developed this habit of silent listening when he was young because he found it a struggle to speak  standard English  correctly in school. Nevertheless, he was always a strong student.Clarence Thomas went on to become a US Supreme Court Justice and champion of our Constitution.Apparently, the Smithsonian can t find space in their museum for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, a highly accomplished conservative black man, who was born into poverty, and through sheer determination and hard work, became the longest serving black Supreme Court Justice in America s history.

If we re removing Confederate monuments after the Civil War, I think we should also be removing mosques after 9/11,  his Facebook post said. It is not an idol.

According to the New York Times article on October 21, 2015, there have been dozens of Syrian refugees settled in Jenks, OK since 2012,  said Bennett.  What s disturbing is that when I contacted the Jenks Police Department about this issue, they advised that the New York Times  article was the first time anyone in their office knew about these resettlements. Bennett continued,  Given the light of the Paris attacks and that some of the terrorists arrived in France as Syrian refugees, I am calling on Governor Fallin to immediately suspend any current plans to relocate Syrian refugees in Jenks or elsewhere in Oklahoma and to identify those that have arrived under the relocation program since 2012.

You know that s history. That was in that point in time. You can t eliminate what history is. So I disapprove with young people pulling down those statues,  she says.Lee then adds,  A young woman died. Two officers were murdered in a plane crash and all for what? Because somebody in their mind decided,  we don t need to look at that anymore. It shouldn t be,  she says softly.President Trump weighed in on the question about taking Confederate statues down by saying,  This week, it s Robert E. Lee. I noticed that Stonewall Jackson is coming down. I wonder is it George Washington next week? Is it Thomas Jefferson the week after? You know, you do really have to ask yourself where does it stop? While Lee doesn t agree with President Trump on everything, she does think that history should be left to stand and advises others to join her in praying for the president.

"LISTEN TO JEH JOHNSONS BIZARRE REASON We Must Remove Confederate Statues&Homeland Security Threat? [Video]","This is rich! The guy who opened our borders to criminals during the Obama era is now telling us that statues are a homeland security threat?  Former Obama administration official Jeh Johnson said on This Week with Martha Raditz that the removal of Confederate statues was a matter of  public safety and homeland security  on Sunday Oh brother!A single protest against the removal of a statue of Robert E. Lee turned violent last week. Charlottesville, WV was the sight of the engineered confrontation of two groups that got out of hand because the police officers were told to stand down.Jeh Johnson served as Secretary of Homeland Security under Obama but failed miserably to keep our homeland secure. We now have a mess that President Trump is trying to clean up. Johnson allowed violent gangs like MS13 to enter towns across America. He allowed thousands of illegal alien minor children to just roam free. Johnson is responsible for much of the illegal alien crime we re seeing now. The lawless policy of Obama and Johnson hurt many Americans.So now Johnson is saying that it s a problem that rallying Americans who want to keep Confederate statues are the violent ones??? THE VIOLENCE IS COMING FROM ANTIFA AND BLACK LIVES MATTER ON THE LEFT!THIS IS NOT TRUE:  What alarms so many of us from a security perspective is that so many of the statues, the Confederate monuments, are now, modern-day, becoming symbols and rallying points for white nationalism, for neo-Nazis, for the KKK, and this is most alarming,  Johnson said.  We fought a world war against Naziism. The KKK reigned terror on African Americans for generations. I salute those in cities and states who are taking down a lot of these monuments for reasons of public safety and security,  he added.  And that s not a a matter of political correctness. That s a matter of public safety and homeland security and doing what s right. Host Martha Raddatz said she felt the Trump administration would call that a  slippery slope,  referring to local Washington locations like Washington-Lee High School and Jefferson Davis Highway.

The two things that are so outrageous about this entire case are that there was NO OVERSIGHT and that this WENT ON FOR 8 YEARS!!!USING THE FEDS AS YOUR OWN PERSONAL PIGGY BANK:Lorena Loren s job was to help poor people find housing Instead, prosecutors say, she was stealing from the poor to buy booze, makeup, clothes and homes for her relatives.But after years of scheming, authorities say, the government caught on. IT TOOK 8 YEARS!In a public corruption case that surfaced in federal court today, Loren, the former executive director of the St. Clair Housing Commission, was charged with embezzling more than $300,000 in low-income housing funds and spending the money on herself and family.According to a charging document filed in U.S. District Court, Loren s scheme ran between 2008-2016 and benefited many family members, including her husband, son and son-in-law.Prosecutors say Loren s criminal activity started in 2008   five years after she was appointed executive director of the St. Clair Housing Commission, which administers federally funded low-income housing programs in St. Clair County.According to court records, Loren used her job in many nefarious ways, including:  She fraudulently used the housing commission s two credit cards to buy personal items for herself and relatives, including nearly $135,000 in online purchases from Amazon.com; $14,364 in purchases from Sam s Club in Port Huron, and $16,460 in purchases from various Walmart stores. The purchases included, among other things, adult and infant clothing, furniture, food, beauty supplies, medications and alcoholic beverages.  Her unauthorized Amazon.com purchases included $60,000 worth of bedroom furniture, mattresses, appliances and other household items for family members. The items were shipped to Loren s relatives in Georgia and Florida.  She embezzled $24,600 in commission funds to pay for her son s rental unit.  She lied on four government housing contracts by claiming that her son-in-law was the landlord of a rental property for low-income residents in Michigan, when it was really her home in Port Austin.  She falsified lease agreements and stole public housing money that was supposed to help poor people to rent a home for her son.  She  directed members of her family to establish bank accounts  so that federal rental subsidy payments could be deposited into those accounts. The relatives then used the money for their own personal use, including rent for their Florida residences.Loren is charged in what is known as an information, which typically means she is working on a deal with the government. She is charged with conspiracy to commit federal program fraud. If convicted, she faces up to five years in prison.Loren home Lorena Loren bought this $325,000 home in Georgia after federal prosecutors say she embezzled more than $336,000 from the St. Clair Housing Commission.JUDICIAL WATCH: HUD s inspector general has testified before Congress about the severe mismanagement at offshoots functioning independently yet federally funded in states across the country that have fleeced taxpayers out of hundreds of millions of dollars. He testified that his office discovered more than $200 million in questionable spending at local public housing agencies (PHAs) since 2012.

"REMEMBER WHEN DONALD TRUMP FOUGHT Palm Beach Officials To Make Mar-a-Lago A Club That Welcomed Blacks and Jews When Other Clubs Excluded Them?","The Washington Post reported: The patriarchs of this quiet island of millionaires threw up roadblocks when Donald Trump swooped in and turned its historic oceanfront Mar-a-Lago mansion into a private club.The town council, seeing Trump as an ostentatious outsider, handed him a list of restrictions as he sought to transform the property in the 1990s. Membership, traffic, party attendance, even photography   all would be strictly limited.But Trump undercut his adversaries with a searing attack, claiming that local officials seemed to accept the established private clubs in town that had excluded Jews and blacks while imposing tough rules on his inclusive one.Trump s lawyer sent every member of the town council copies of two classic movies about discrimination:  A Gentleman s Agreement,  about a journalist who pretends to be Jewish to expose anti-Semitism, and  Guess Who s Coming to Dinner  about a white couple s reaction to their daughter bringing home a black fiance.The move infuriated council members, who said it was a distraction from their concerns that Trump s club would spoil a quiet street. But, in time, Trump got most of the restrictions lifted.In many ways Mar-a-Lago is the antithesis of the area s traditional WASP-y clubs the Beach Club, the Bath and Tennis Club, the Sailfish Club. The Everglades Club, Palm Beach s oldest and founded in 1919, is what Nicholas Golubov, research director for the Historical Society of Palm Beach, called a bastion of  the old, Palm Beach elite. Trump s business model in Palm Beach, by comparison, has been a beacon of inclusion. As long as potential members had the $100,000 entry fee (bumped up to $200,000 in January), there was a good chance that they d be accepted. In a further departure from Palm Beach taste, Trump allowed non-members, as well as members, to rent spaces for bar mitzvahs, bat mitzvahs, weddings, and charity galas. Anyone can party at the new Winter White House, as long as they can afford it. I think it s the best thing Trump did in his whole life,  said Laurence Leamer, the author of the book Madness Under the Royal Palms: Love and Death Behind the Gates of Palm Beach.  He opened up this island. He also had Jews and gays and African Americans he even had the first gay wedding. Most Palm Beach clubs have unapologetically restrictive membership policies, but resist any notion that those policies have anything to do with race, creed, or color.  That s an old-fashioned view, certainly of our club,  said John Newman, general manager Sailfish Club.  We have no discrimination in our club; members have to be sponsored by a current member, but we have all faiths in our club.  (The Bath and Tennis, Beach, and Everglades clubs declined to comment for this article; Mar-a-Lago did not respond to requests for comment.) Bloomberg Palm Beach has a lot of rules: No whistling allowed on public streets after midnight. No  Missing Dog    or any sign   posted on a tree. And no flag poles taller than 42 feet.In late 2006 Trump put up a giant American flag on an 80-foot pole. That led to a $1,250-a-day fine against him, drawing national headlines that Trump basked in. Tonight, Donald Trump does legal battle again, this time with a bunch of millionaires down in Palm Beach, Florida, who told Trump he s flying his flag too high,  is how Nancy Grace started her CNN interview in January 2007 with Trump.  Can you fly the American flag too high?  she asked.Trump got fan mail as he said in a blizzard of interviews:  No American should have to get a permit to fly the flag. I said,  This is a dream to have someone sue me to take down the American flag,  Trump said in the interview.Trump sued Palm Beach for $25 million in damages, arguing the flag was constitutionally protected free speech.Ultimately, Trump reached a settlement with the town. He would put a slightly smaller flag farther from the road and mount it on a 70-foot pole.Instead of paying any fines, Trump made a $100,000 donation to a veterans charity.",politics,"Aug 20, 2017"

The content of this manual is disturbing and should be read by every American, so we understand what we are up against. It helps to explain why these groups call our President and his supporters  Hitler  or  racists  or  homophobes.  It s not that Trump or his supporters are any of these things, it s just part of a campaign to humiliate and shut down any opposition to radicals whose ultimate goal is a one world order and the destruction of capitalism in America. This manual gives every day Americans a look into the mind of a leftist radical who hates America and everything Americans stand for. They clearly have no regard for free-speech and are willing to use any means necessary, including deceit, outright lies and of course, violence to achieve their ultimate goals of a New World Order.This page explains how Antifa members are to use name-calling as a means to create a culture of tolerance.  When all else fails, compare someone to Hitler.  Next they discuss how to use ones minority status, and to remember that you are  Black first  and  American second.  or  Gay/Lesbian first  and  American third  and so on.It s important to gain control of the media through any means necessary.Some major media conglomerates are swinging to our side, but they have not gone far enough.It s no coincidence that CNN just published a fluff piece on Antifa today: Unmasking the leftist Antifa movementThe CNN piece was clearly written to shed a sympathetic light on the violent group that s been caught attacking and harming so many innocent Americans, many of them were harmed by Antifa for defending free speech and/or our President Donald J. Trump.Look for the leftist media to kick it into high gear when it comes to defending the violence perpetrated on innocent Americans by the violent Antifa group. More of these soft pieces on the radical Antifa group are sure to be popping up over the next several months.If you are seeking positions of power in the media, be sure to obfuscate and hide your true intentions on the various social media platforms.Use social media as a baton to slap down anyone who hold fascist viewpoints. Call them racist, homophobic, misogynistic. Create an echo chamber around you.The next step is to threaten the livelihood of anyone who dares speak out against our agenda.The pro-abortion page: This page talks about how white people are able to afford to have their  fetuses  aborted, while  people of color  have little choice but to keep a baby to term.And finally, the ultimate goal is a New World Order and a New World Government where hatred and bigotry no longer exist. Imagine, if Antifa could figure out a way through George Soros funded activity, to shut down the rights of every American using violence and hatred at tools, their dream might just be possible until they wake up and realize of course, that most Americans don t hate this country and aren t interested in Antifa s special brand of violence and chaos.",politics,"Aug 19, 2017"

A great example of the problem is the latest statue to be vandalized:On top of people calling for the removal of George Washington s statue and the Jefferson Memorial, vandals in California have pointed their crosshairs at recently-canonized St. Junipero Serra.According to a CBS Local report, a photo circulating the rounds on Facebook shows that a statue of Junipero Serra alongside a Native American boy in a park across from Mission San Fernando was vandalized with red paint and the word  murder  written in white. The Native American boy had a swastika painted across his chest.City officials could not confirm the photo s authenticity. However, when investigators went to the site, they did indeed see red paint on Serra s arm and a swastika painted on the child next to him, which means the neighboring Catholic mission apparently cleaned the statue as best they could to avoid drawing controversy.That would make perfect sense, considering that whenever the Left gets their hands on controversy like this, they always show up to get their inner Bolshevik on.Some of the people interviewed by CBS expressed disapproval of the statue s presence, falsely claiming that St. Junipero Serra sought the destruction of Native American culture.Read more: Daily Wire",politics,"Aug 19, 2017"

Would this video of an Afghanistan veteran, who appears to be all by himself in a large group of violent, Soros funded Antifa thugs,  be splashed all over every network in America if he was verbally assaulted by this group of masked cowards for defending Barack Obama during his presidency? If we didn t know better, we d almost think there was a double standard in America.Antifa assembled at the entry point of the free speech rally. pic.twitter.com/FaXVdnbfD0  Kirk and Callahan (@KirkAndCallahan) August 19, 2017There is no place for these types of violent, masked cowards in America.

"LIBERALS HAVE NO BUSINESS Criticizing President Trump Until They Can Explain What Former President Obama Is Doing In This Photo","The Democrats and their allies in the media have spent most of this entire week condemning President Trump for blaming both sides for the violent confrontations in Charlottesville, Va. The problem is, President Trump never once condoned the actions of the KKK or the Nazi sympathizers. Trump simply said that both sides (including the violent Antifa and Black Lives Matter protesters) were at fault.Where was the condemnation from the media and the Democrat Party when President Barack Obama eulogized the former KKK Grand Dragon Robert Byrd?  In the early 1940s, a politically ambitious butcher from West Virginia named Bob Byrd recruited 150 of his friends and associates to form a chapter of the Ku Klux Klan. After Byrd had collected the $10 joining fee and $3 charge for a robe and hood from every applicant, the  Grand Dragon  for the mid-Atlantic states came down to tiny Crab Orchard, W.Va., to officially organize the chapter.As Byrd recalls now, the Klan official, Joel L. Baskin of Arlington, Va., was so impressed with the young Byrd s organizational skills that he urged him to go into politics.  The country needs young men like you in the leadership of the nation,  Baskin said.The young Klan leader went on to become one of the most powerful and enduring figures in modern Senate history. Throughout a half-century on Capitol Hill, Sen. Robert C. Byrd (D-W.Va.) has twice held the premier leadership post in the Senate, helped win ratification of the Panama Canal treaty, squeezed billions from federal coffers to aid his home state, and won praise from liberals for his opposition to the war in Iraq and his defense of minority party rights in the Senate.   Washington PostWhen the KKK Grand Dragon died in July of 2010, President Barack Obama eulogized him, while Hillary Clinton sang the praises of the West Virginia Democrat Senator Robert Byrd she called her  mentor. During his eulogy, President Barack Obama expressed his admiration for the KKK Grand Dragon and later, the US Senator Robert Byrd: And as I reflect on the full sweep of his 92 years, it seems to me that his life bent towards justice,  Obama said.  Like the Constitution he tucked in his pocket, like our nation itself, Robert Byrd possessed that quintessential American quality, and that is a capacity to change, a capacity to learn, a capacity to listen, a capacity to be made more perfect.

Republican leaders like Bob Goodlatte made it clear to the Trump administration s DOJ that they wanted this program to end ASAP.Eric Holder launched the program when he was attorney general.

HUH? SHOULDN T IT GO WITHOUT SAYING THAT THE DOJ SHOULDN T TARGET CERTAIN BUSINESSES???

All of the Department s bank investigations conducted as part of Operation Chokepoint are now over, the initiative is no longer in effect, and it will not be undertaken again,  Assistant Attorney General Stephen Boyd said in the Aug. 16-dated letter, calling it a  misguided initiative  from the prior administration.Read more: Fox News",politics,"Aug 18, 2017"

It s very likely that Steve Bannon, who was one of Andrew Breitbart s best friends, knew, and understood the left better than any person on Trump s White House staff. This could be a big blow to Trump and the unprecedented battle he s been fighting against a ruthless and moral-less opponent.White House chief strategist Steve Bannon is leaving his position in President Donald Trump s administration. White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Steve Bannon have mutually agreed today would be Steve s last day,  press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement Friday.  We are grateful for his service and wish him the best. The Drudge Report first reported the news, and said that he may return to the conservative website Breitbart.The political strategist reportedly submitted his resignation to the president on Aug. 7, according to The New York Times. While it was scheduled for Monday, Bannon s resignation was delayed in the aftermath of the violent protests in Charlottesville, Va., over the weekend. Trump and administration officials have been deliberating for some time as to when and how to release Bannon.Bannon was one of the first people to jump on board the president s political team when he announced his bid for the presidency in 2015. Rumors floated Thursday that Bannon might lose his job after the political strategist landed in hot water after The Prospect released an article Wednesday in which Bannon made some unsavory comments regarding members of the administration.  Daily CallerAnn Coulter told the Daily Caller that the Bannon firing is  Not good news  and that  Trump should ve hired ten more like him Conservative commentator Ann Coulter is upset about Steve Bannon s ouster and believes it  makes it appear that Trump is easily manipulable by the media. Bannon, a staunch conservative and supporter of Trump s agenda, left his post as White House chief strategist Friday after months of media criticism. The former Breitbart executive kept a whiteboard in his wall that kept track of Trump s campaign promises and was in a constant battle against moderates in the White House like Gary Cohn and Jared Kushner. This makes it appear that Trump is easily manipulable by the media,  Coulter told The Daily Caller Friday over email.  They just need to give all credit to any White House staffer they want to get rid of. I dread to think of who the media decide to get rid of next. President Trump has recently been upset about a book that heavily credits Bannon with Trump s White House victory. He told a close confidant,  I hate it when people take credit for an election I won. Coulter wrote to the TheDC,  Trump is right that Bannon isn t responsible for Trump s win. Of course, Trump won the nomination and the presidency of his own will! Bannon supported those issues and supported Trump at least as early as January 2016,  Coulter added.  Who else in the White House did? Most of the White House staff wasn t on the Trump train until after the election. She went on to write:  Not good news. Instead of firing Bannon, because Trump had his nose out of joint about the media giving Bannon all credit for the victory, Trump should ve hired ten more like him. Media heads would have exploded. Former Speaker of the House and longtime Trump supporter Newt Gingrich is seriously worried about the future of Donald Trump s presidency.Gingrich, who has consistently been one of Trump s most optimistic supporters, said Friday morning that Trump is more isolated than he realizes and needs to make  serious changes  if he s going to have a stable presidency. I think he s in a position right now where he s much more isolated than he realizes,  Gingrich said in an interview with Fox News  Bill Hemmer.  On the Hill, he has far more people willing to sit to one side and not help him right now, and I think that he needs to recognize that he s taken a good first step with bringing in General Kelly, but he needs to think about what has not worked. You don t get down to 35 percent approval and have people in your own party shooting at you and conclude that everything s going fine.   Daily Caller ",politics,"Aug 18, 2017"

On a day in which an Islamic terrorist killed over a dozen people in Barcelona, senior editor Wilber Cooper has the audacity to publish an article for VICE Magazine urging the left to destroy Mt. Rushmore just like ISIS would.In his article  Let s Blow Up Mount Rushmore,  Cooper attacks the Founding Fathers and calls for a demolition of the monument. His call to erase historical markers, such as statues, echoes the recent movement from left-wingers for a culture war that would decimate Americans  political traditions and heroes. Those targeted heroes include Thomas Jefferson, former president and chief author of the Bill of Rights   such as the First Amendment   and General and President George Washington, who declined offers to become a dictator after winning the Revolutionary War.Cooper argues that these historical monuments and statues help preserve a system of racial exploitation and inequality, and should be erased to help build a new society. He says,  It s going to be impossible to improve America if we can t be honest about its origins and its past. He insists that  Trump and his white supremacist cohorts believe the reverence some Americans have for these statues is simply respect for history, and that tearing them down is tantamount to ripping pages out of a textbook.

"ATLANTA JUDGE Punished for Telling the Truth About Radical Antifa Protesters Tearing Down Monuments","And once again, the snowflakes want to erase parts of history they know nothing about.

Judge James Hinkle wrote,  It looks like all of the snowflakes have no concept of history. It is what it is. Get over it and move on.  He went on to add,  The nut cases tearing down monuments are equivalent to ISIS destroying history.

Following these posts, Hinkle was told by Gwinnett County s chief magistrate that he was suspended. Chief Judge Kristina Blum released the following statement:  I have made it clear to all of our judges to conduct themselves in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity, impartiality, and fairness of the judiciary. I consider any violation of those principles and policies to be a matter of utmost concern. Hinkle, who also served as the mayor of Grayson for over twenty years, previously made his views well known on social media when he posted he was  proud to be a deplorable infidel.

Maria Chappelle-Nadal, D-University City, in which she stated:  I hope Trump is assassinated! A conversation between MO state Senator Maria Chappelle-Nadal and Christopher Gagn  of Ferguson, MO, (In his Facebook profile he claims he s an  Investigative Journalist focused on Social Justice, Police Misconduct and Prison Reform ) was screen shot and saved before either party had a chance to delete it. The conversation included the senator openly hoping that President Trump would be assassinated and Facebook user Christophe Gagne, who told her that his cousin is on President Trump s  Secret Service Detail . Gagn s comments seem to infer that his cousin is being forced to protect President Trump because he had to sign up for 6 years of service and has already served 4 years of his contract protecting Barack Obama. Gagn  went on to say,   I truly believe [it] will happen sooner not later.  while referring to the assassination of our president.For obvious reasons, everyone seems to be focused on what the MO state Senator said when she openly hoped for Trump s assassination, but shouldn t the Secret Service be making a call to Christopher Gagn  who claims to have a cousin assigned to protecting the life of our president and claiming that he will be assassinated sooner than later? Does Gagn have some sort of an inside scoop? For all we know, Gagn  may not even be telling the truth about having a cousin on President Trump s Secret Service detail, but sure seems it would certainly be worth the time it would take for the Secret Service to look into it.  St. Louis Post-Dispatch: Chappelle-Nadal s comment, referring to President Donald Trump, has since been removed. But Chappelle-Nadal confirmed to the Post-Dispatch that she had written it in response to another commenter before deleting it. I didn t mean what I put up. Absolutely not.

The U.S. Secret Service s St. Louis field office  is looking into this,  the office confirmed.Kristina Schmidt, special agent in charge, told the Post-Dispatch that  hypothetically  in such investigations, agents try to  determine intent, to determine if there was a violation of federal law. If there is, then we refer it to the U.S. Attorney. Our primary goal is to determine if there is intent and meaning behind it,  Schmidt said.According to a screenshot of the now-deleted conversation obtained by the Post-Dispatch, another commenter named Christopher Gagn  was writing about a cousin of his who he said was on Trump s Secret Service detail.

"THROWING GAS ON RACIAL FIRE? VA Police Confirm&.Governor Terry McAuliffe LIED About Weapons Being Hid Around Charlottesville By White Nationalists","Will the mainstream media report about this?Contradicting statements by Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, the Virginia State Police say they did not find caches of weapons stashed around Charlottesville in advance of last Saturday s deadly white nationalist rally.In an interview Monday on the Pod Save the People podcast, hosted by Black Lives Matter activist DeRay Mckesson, McAuliffe claimed the white nationalists who streamed into Charlottesville that weekend hid weapons throughout the town. They had battering rams and we had picked up different weapons that they had stashed around the city,  McAuliffe told Mckesson.McAuliffe s comments were picked up by other news outlets and spread through social media. But Corinne Geller, a spokesperson for the Virginia State Police, says that no such stashes were found. The governor was referring to the briefing provided him in advance of Saturday s rally and the extra security measures being taken by local and state police,  Geller tells Reason.  As a safety precaution in advance of August 12, such searches were conducted in and around Emancipation and McIntire Parks. No weapons were located as a result of those searches. The Virginia State Police also disputed McAuliffe s claims that Virginia State Police were underequipped to deal with the heavily armed militia members at Saturday s rally. The governor was referencing the weapons and tactical gear the members of various groups attending the rally had on their persons,  Geller says.  I can assure you that the Virginia State Police personnel were equipped with more-than-adequate specialized tactical and protective gear for the purpose of fulfilling their duties to serve and protect those in attendance of the August 12 event in Charlottesville. McAuliffe claimed in an interview with The New York Times that law enforcement arrived to find a line of militia members who  had better equipment than our State Police had.  In longer comments that were later edited out of the Times  story, McAuliffe said that up to 80 percent of the rally attendees were carrying semi-automatic weapons.

CNN host Kate Bolduan asked Rye if the country s ongoing discussion about race and white supremacy, spurred by the violence in Charlottesville Va. last weekend, is really about Confederate statues and monuments.Rye, a former executive director of the Congressional Black Caucus, said the problem is people are taught American history incorrectly, because they are only told about the  glories  of the country s past, not darker issues like racism.She added that because George Washington and other great American historical figures owned slaves, they deserved to be called out and recognized not for their accomplishments, but for their title of  slave owner. George Washington was a slave owner, and we need to call slave owners out for what they are, whether we think they were protecting American freedom or not,  Rye said.

Lee and Stonewall Jackson will be removed from the CUNY hall of great Americans because New York stands against racism.  Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) August 17, 2017Sean Davis, co-founder of The Federalist quickly schooled the leftist governor on the history behind the naming of the state of New York:New York is named after the head of a British slave-trading monopoly. https://t.co/edp3ZzYWyr  Sean Davis (@seanmdav) August 17, 2017The Duke of York was the main shareholder in and the director of the Company of Royal Adventurers Trading in Africa; established at the time of the restoration of the English monarchy in 1660. The shareholders in this Company were a combination of the Stuart Royal family along with a number of wealthy London merchants. The Company established London s monopoly of the English slave trade. It created slave ports on the West coast of Africa where British-produced goods were exchanged for Africans who were then transported as slaves to colonies in the Caribbean and the Americas.In 1664, the Duke of York, as Admiral of the Navy, annexed the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam (it was then renamed New York in his honour). When the Duke took over New York one of the first actions of the new authority was to grant the colony port privileges and the right to use warehouses to ships engaged in the slave trade (1) ~ i.e. ships owned by the Company of Royal Adventurers Trading in Africa in which the Duke was the largest shareholder.Previously, under the Dutch West India Company, the African slaves of New Amsterdam had lived in what was known as  half-freedom ; that is to say under the Dutch they had some rights and some, limited, independence. However, once under Stuart, British rule they became chattel slaves (i.e perceived as personal property of the slave owners in a way that was different from previous slave-systems. It was slavery used as labour under an emerging and consolidating capitalism). Though it is worth noting that these urban slaves of New York never accepted the complete servitude endured by their rural counterparts.President Trump took to Twitter this morning to denounce decisions being made by leftists in positions of authority to erase the history of our great nation:Sad to see the history and culture of our great country being ripped apart with the removal of our beautiful statues and monuments.

Black Lives Matter protesters put themselves between the police officer and the Antifa crowd, and the gathering soon dispersed.Protesters vandalized and attempted to take down the Peace Monument in Piedmont Park in Atlanta on Sunday, mistaking it for a pro-Confederate statue. The protesters were marching in response to the violent protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday where one woman died after being deliberately hit by a car, and two law enforcement personnel were killed when the helicopter they were in crashed. The Atlanta march traveled from Woodruff Park to Piedmont Park Sunday, where some damaged the Peace Monument, erected in 1911,  a blog on the Atlanta Journal-Constitution website said.  The sculpture features an angel standing above a Confederate soldier, guiding him to lay down his weapon.

"ICELAND PROUDLY CLAIMS TO HAVE ERADICATED Down Syndrome&In Most Gruesome Way Imaginable","Mainstream news channels rarely draw attention to the negative side of abortion, but CBS News did so this week with a report about Iceland s near 100-percent abortion rate for babies with Down syndrome.  few countries have come as close to eradicating Down syndrome births as Iceland,  the report begins.  Since prenatal screening tests were introduced in Iceland in the early 2000s, the vast majority of women   close to 100 percent   who received a positive test for Down syndrome terminated their pregnancy. Just a handful of children with Down syndrome have been born in Iceland in the past decade. Two are born each year, on average, but the rest are killed in the womb. For most of the children who were born, their mothers decided not to have prenatal screening tests.This deadly discrimination against babies with disabilities is a problem in countries across the world, not just Iceland. In 2014, the Danish government reported 98 percent of unborn babies who tested positive for Down syndrome were aborted. CBS reports the rate in France was 77 percent in 2015, 90 percent in the United Kingdom and 67 percent in the U.S. between 1995 and 2011. Some put the rate even higher in the United States, but it is difficult to determine the exact number because the U.S. government does not keep detailed statistics about abortion.In many of these countries, late-term abortions are legal in cases of fetal anomalies, such as Down syndrome. The UK, for example, prohibits abortions after 24 weeks but allows wide exceptions for late-term abortions involving fetal anomalies.Iceland hospital counselor Helga Sol Olafsdottir does not see any problem with the fact that so many women are having their unborn babies aborted because of Down syndrome. This systematic discrimination is simply a  woman s choice  in her mind.The issue is not gray. It s very clearly wrong, says Penny Nace, president and CEO of Concerned Women for America. This is eugenics and barbarianism at best,  Nace said.  These individuals have no less worth than anyone else. Iceland and many other countries are killing human beings in abortions simply because they have a disability. Down syndrome varies in severity, but most people with the genetic disorder live into their 60s. Some even live on their own, hold down jobs, go to college and get married.For entire story   Life News",politics,"Aug 16, 2017"

"ALT-LEFT PROFESSOR Makes Outrageous Claim: Flag-Burning Antifa Preserving Fabric of America [Video]","Political grandstanding has become a blood sport It s obvious that the CNN anchor set up the question so Dyson s answer could be to  slaughter  our president with his words shameful! Professor Dyson and Mitt Romney (who supports Antifa) are CLUELESS!Dyson:  This man is lethally ignorant, incapable of even having a kindergartner s comprehension of race. For those who say look, the confederacy is about history and heritage, it is. The history and heritage of racism! The history and heritage of bigotry. Building their sense of biological and in many cases theological and national identity upon a lie, a mythology of white supremacy. The belief that some people are inherently superior and some people are inherently inferior.For the president then to defend the actions against taking down Robert E. Lee, or Stonewall Jackson   remember, these people hated America enough to want the secede from it. The people that we claim, black lives matter, the antifa movement and so on, are interested in preserving the fabric of America. Mr. Miller says again, that there was violence there, but the problem is to equate that violence in reaction to the bigotry, with the bigotry itself is to misunderstand the fact that when you go to cancer treatment, the radiation is tough treatment, but it is meant to remove the cancer.So what he fails to understand and what the president especially fails to understand is that you are complicit with the worst currents of bigotry in this country when you try to draw a false equivalence between secessionists, racists and confederate defenders and bigots and Neo-Nazis and African-American and white people and others who have defended the rights of this nation to really seek a path of healing beyond the consternation we see now. That s the problem with this president, he ain t got the right moral vision, he doesn t have the right words to express that moral vision and he lacks an understanding of American history. This is the most illiterate, incompetent president in the history of this nation and it shows and it tells on him in the midst of this racial crisis where he is incapable of showing basic decent compassion for those who are vulnerable and who are victims of white supremacy in this country.

"COLLEGE HOLDS EARLY SEGREGATED ORIENTATION To Help ONLY Minority Students With Financial Aid and Schedules","THIS IS EXPECTED FROM THIS LEFTY COLLEGE Will it trickle out to other colleges? Participants were able to move in before most other students.  Privilege much? Victimhood translates to doing exactly what the  so called  victims fought against .Go figureThe University of California, Berkeley invited certain  special populations  of new students to move in a day early to attend racially-exclusive orientation sessions.According to a guide to the new  Golden Bear Orientation  program, the school offered a special programming on Monday for a variety of populations, including Hispanic students, black students, Native American students, and Asian American/Pacific Islander students. We want all our students to make it to orientation and to have an accessible and equitable experience.  Tweet This Most other students,  meanwhile, spent the day moving into their residence halls and preparing for the main freshman orientation program, which runs from August 15-22.The  Black Student Orientation  aimed to address  the specific transitional and community needs of African American/Black students  at the university with  community building activities, academic and campus life workshops, and a resource fair. As part of the  Black Student Orientation,  students participated in a  Black World Tour  in which they were taken around the surrounding area for a showcase of  black owned businesses. [RELATED: Black Harvard grads to hold separate commencement ceremony]Similarly, a  Familia Orientation  was offered for  Chicanx and Latinx  students on August 13, while an  Asian American Pacific Islander Student Orientation  was reserved for responding to the  specific transitional and community needs of Asian American, Pilipinx , and Pacific Islander students. A final  special population  orientation was provided for  native students  enrolled at the elite institution, who were encouraged to show up early to  map locations of your classes, get to know campus, meet continuing Cal Native students and other new Native students, and have a little fun before classes start. In fact, the Native American Student Development Office touts on its website that  another bonus  of attending the exclusive orientation was being  eligible for early move-in,  a benefit that the African American Student Development Center similarly advertises on its website, noting that participants were able to move in before  most other students.

I believe that when he begins to act as if he deserves to be in that office, and leads in terms of unifying people, then he will deserve the name of President Trump. But at this point, I believe that he has not done the things in regards to bringing this country together. CHRIS CUOMO: Do you believe the president helped with what he said yesterday?WES BELLAMY: I believe that 45 did make some strides in regards to specifically condemning the white supremacists and the KKK . . . I would love to move away from the remarks and comments of 45 and focus more on what s going on here on the ground in Charlottesville . . . So again, I m not as concerned with what 45 is doing, I m more concerned with us progressing as a community.CHRIS CUOMO: Wes, quick question. Why do you refer to the president as 45? Yes, he is the 45th president, but is that intentional, or is that just a quick term.BELLAMY: Well, that s just what I call him. I believe that when he begins to act as if he deserves to be in that office, and leads in terms of unifying people, then he will deserve the name of President Trump. But at this point, I believe that he has not done the things in regards to bringing this country together, he has not done the things in regards to making us a more unified place.

Crawford downplayed the racist comments and made no mention of Bellamy s punishment for the disgusting tweets he sent (see below) His past tweets suggest that he was part of the race problem. But CBS purposefully minimized his history, shifting the blame onto the vice mayor s opponents.  Supporters of the statue unearth crude tweets written by Bellamy as a younger man,  Crawford noted,  and he also was targeted with death threats, but Bellamy feels his fight is justified.

CAIR is linked to terrorists and is doing their best to infiltrate all that is America to change it. Removing Confederate statues is just CAIR trying to score political points with the left. How dare they demand anything of us This terrorist group should be named and shamed.The Daily Caller reported:Nihad Awad, CAIR s national executive director, urged state and local governments to erase every symbol and every vestige of Confederate history immediately. A fitting response to the deadly terror attack on anti-racist protesters in Charlottesville would be for officials in states and cities nationwide to immediately announce that every street, every school, every flag, and every public memorial honoring those who took up arms in defense of white supremacy and slavery will be removed or have its name changed to instead honor those who fought for civil rights,  Awad said in a statement to The Daily Caller. Removal of these memorials would be a small step forward in turning the page on the darkest period in our nation s history,  Awad also said.THE CAIR TEMPLATE FOR ERASING OUR HISTORY AS AMERICANS:Council on American Islamic Relations (CAIR) Resolution Template Requesting the Removal of All Confederate Memorials, Flags, Street Names, and Symbols from Public Spaces and Property August XX, 2017Requesting the Removal of All Confederate Memorials, Flags, Street Names, and Symbols from Public Spaces and Property Whereas the preservation of these memorials validates the subjugation experienced by African-Americans due to their size, prominent placement and public display;  Whereas the investments and arrangement made to recognize Confederate figures communicates core beliefs that promote the endurance of white supremacy and racism;  Whereas every Confederate memorial, flag, street name, and symbol proclaims the injustices and suffering experienced by African-Americans as insignificant and dismissible;  Whereas every Confederate memorial, flag, street name, and symbol commemorates and honors those who fought to enslave African-Americans;  Whereas every Confederate memorial, flag, street name, and symbol diminishes the numerous contributions and services African-Americans made, and continue to make, to the United States;  Whereas every Confederate memorial, flag, street name, and symbol celebrates individuals who campaigned against giving African-Americans their rights and liberty;  Whereas every public symbol that references the Confederacy in the United States glorifies individuals who sought to divide the nation and preserve white supremacy;  Whereas the removal of all memorials, flags, street names, and symbols of Confederacy from public spaces and property reaffirms to the public, especially African-Americans and other minority groups, that we do not endorse the ideals these objects represent;  Whereas the removal of all public references to the Confederacy would respect the entitlement of African-Americans and others to equal protection of their civil and human rights;YADA, YADA, YADA ",politics,"Aug 15, 2017"
"HERE WE GO: GEORGIA POLITICIAN Calls for Removal of Stone Mountains Giant Carving of Confederate Leaders: A blight on our state","The politicians are using our monuments to history as bargaining chips to gain votes. It s sickening to see the back and forth with the cowardly bunch of lily livered sellouts who would rather win their seat than fight for what the people want. Yes, the people WANT to keep these incredible statues and carvings because anyone with half a brain knows you should never erase the past EVER! If we erase our history, who are we?    Pat BuchananIt s heartbreaking to see these pieces of our history torn apart or removed to gather dust somewhere. What s wrong with these politicians in Georgia who are bowing to the liberal elites? Stand up for those who have relatives both black and white who fought in the Civil War. Shame on you!PANDERING FOR VOTES USING OUR MONUMENTS AS COLLATERAL Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams called for the removal of the giant carving that depicts three Confederate war leaders on the face of state-owned Stone Mountain, saying it  remains a blight on our state and should be removed. We must never celebrate those who defended slavery and tried to destroy the union,  Abrams said in a series of tweets posted early Tuesday, a response to the deadly violence sparked by white supremacist groups in Charlottesville, Va.Removing the faces of Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson would take a monster of a sandblaster and require a change in state law. The Georgia code has a clear mandate for the memorial, saying it should be  preserved and protected for all time as a tribute to the bravery and heroism of the citizens of this state who suffered and died in their cause. Lawmakers and civil rights groups have called for the removal of Confederate symbols at the memorial for years. After the 2015 shooting deaths of nine black worshipers by a white supremacist in Charleston, several legislators pushed for a boycott until Rebel flags at the site come down.Georgia leaders have embraced recent changes to distance the state from its Rebel history.Gov. Nathan Deal quietly struck Confederate Memorial Day from the state s official holiday calendar and removed the statue of a segregationist leader from the state grounds. State-issued license plates featuring the Rebel emblem have been altered, though only slightly. Statues and paintings of Confederate leaders in the statehouse are facing fresh criticism. And the state is set to unveil a statue of Martin Luther King Jr. outside the Capitol this month.Four high-profile Republicans are in the race, and several were critical of her stance. Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle said the state has taken  great strides  to add exhibits that give a more inclusive view of the Civil War. Instead of dividing Georgians with inflammatory rhetoric for political gain,  he said,  we should work together to add to our history, not take from it.

We have already created over one million jobs since I took office.We will be discussing economic issues in greater detail later this afternoon, but, based on the events that took place over the weekend in Charlottesville, Virginia, I would like to provide the nation with an update on the ongoing federal response to the horrific attack and violence that was witnessed by everyone.I just met with FBI Director Christopher Wray and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The Department of Justice has opened a civil rights investigation into the deadly car attack that killed one innocent American and wounded 20 others.

And those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including the KKK, neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups that are repugnant to everything we hold dear as Americans.We are a nation founded on the truth that all of us are created equal. We are equal in the eyes of our Creator. We are equal under the law. And we are equal under our Constitution. Those who spread violence in the name of bigotry strike at the very core of America.Two days ago, a young American woman, Heather Heyer, was tragically killed. Her death fills us with grief, and we send her family our thoughts, our prayers, and our love.We also mourn the two Virginia state troopers who died in service to their community, their commonwealth, and their country. Troopers Jay Cullen and Burke Bates exemplify the very best of America, and our hearts go out to their families, their friends, and every member of American law enforcement.These three fallen Americans embody the goodness and decency of our nation. In times such as these, America has always shown its true character: responding to hate with love, division with unity, and violence with an unwavering resolve for justice.As a candidate, I promised to restore law and order to our country, and our federal law enforcement agencies are following through on that pledge. We will spare no resource in fighting so that every American child can grow up free from violence and fear. We will defend and protect the sacred rights of all Americans, and we will work together so that every citizen in this blessed land is free to follow their dreams in their hearts, and to express the love and joy in their souls.Thank you.

"WAKE UP! GEORGE SOROS Drastically Ramps Up Effort To Destroy America","George Soros is trying his best to destroy America! He is ramping up his efforts now! James Woods said it best when he tweeted that Soros would be happy with what happened in Charlottesville: Attorney General Jeff Sessions released a statement that there would be an investigation into what happened in Charlottesville. We re hoping Sessions digs deep! If AG Jeff Sessions doesn t dig deep ASAP to uncover Soros  involvement in Antifa and BLM, then this Soros-funded war will continue. We need a fighter to win the battle against this evil Hungarian globalist!Liberal billionaire George Soros s advocacy arm is ramping up its lobbying efforts this year, disclosure forms show.SOROS WANTS OPEN BORDERS AND GLOBALISM:The amount Soros spent on lobbying shot up to $11 million in 2013, a drastic increase from the $3.4 million the group had spent in 2012. The uptick could be attributed to the group s push for  comprehensive immigration reform  during this time.The Open Society Policy Center, a D.C.-based nonprofit that focuses on advocacy efforts and is a separate entity from the Soros grant making Open Society Foundations, has spent nearly as much on lobbying in the first half of 2017 as the group did in the entirety of 2016.The Open Society Policy Center reported spending $4.6 million in the first and second quarters, which runs from Jan. 1 to June 30, according its disclosure forms filed to the House of Representatives and the Senate.THREE IN-HOUSE LOBBYISTS? The group has three in-house lobbyists who lobby the U.S. Senate, House of Representatives, National Security Council, the Department of Defense, and the Department of State.Soros even  tried to influence the decision of the Supreme court on immigration according to The Daily Caller:Open Society Foundations, Hungarian-born billionaire George Soros  stated vehicle for progressive social change, orchestrated a well-funded attempt to secure a desired outcome in a U.S. Supreme Court case on illegal immigration enforcement, according to a newly discovered memo between the organization s top U.S. officials and board members.Soros drastically extended the policy scope of his lobbying efforts as the year progressed, including to issues that have been seen as a direct strike against the Hungarian-born billionaire.IF HUNGARY (SOROS  HOME COUNTRY) CAN TRY AND BAN HIS GOV T INTERFERENCE, WHY CAN T WE?From January to March, Soros s group lobbied on three issues. From April to June, the group lobbied 17 different issues, including the Bill on Foreign Funded Organizations in Hungary (LexNGo), Hungary s crack down on foreign-funded organizations in the country.Hungary s parliament approved the law that targets foreign-funded organizations in June, which they have said  can threaten the country s political and economic interests and interfere with the functioning of its institutions,  according to text of the law.Although the law does not mention Soros by name, politicians in Hungary previously said they wanted to  sweep out  organizations tied to Soros.Soros s Open Society Foundations has given money to a number of prominent NGOs in Hungary. The group has said that the country s bill  seeks to suppress democratic voices in Hungary. The lobbyists also worked on issues such as the Restricting First Use of Nuclear Weapons Act of 2017 and the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018, among others.Soros s lobbying efforts have quietly skyrocketed in recent years.The policy center reported spending $19,120,000 on lobbying for policy and legislative efforts with Congress and government agencies between 2002 and 2012, which averages out to $1.9 million per year.WE HAD A PUPPET MASTER PULLING THE STRINGS IN THE WHITE HOUSE FOR 8 YEARS!

"MEDIA WONT SHOW VIDEO Of Trump Telling Matt Lauer David Duke Is A Bigot and A Racist&IGNORES HILLARYS Ties To Former KKK Leader, Democrat Senator Robert Byrd","It is awfully ironic how the liberals are bashing President Trump for placing blame on both sides for the violence in the Charlottesville incident and not condemning just the white supremacists, considering they conveniently overlooked Hillary and Obama s close friendship with former KKK member, Robert Byrd.Following the Charlottesville incident involving a car crashing into a crowd of people, President Trump seemed to be one of the only figures in the country condemning both sides for their displays of violence and bigotry. It was not clear who, exactly, was behind the attack, or which group was responsible.Trump waited until the dust settled and condemned both sides, as both sides warrant condemnation in this situation: from the white supremacists to the black supremacists, to the Communists, to Antifa, the situation was hardly one-sided.David Duke attempted to link Trump to the bigotry and hatred that was present in Charlottesville, however, it would be a far cry to say that the President is in any way happy with or affiliated with Duke or those he associates with, and to say so is to insult the President and his supporters.However, President Trump, back when he was dropping out of the Reform Party primary in 2000, condemned David Duke.When pressed by Matt Lauer on why he saw the Reform Party as self-destructing, Trump commented: Well, you ve got David Duke just joined, a bigot, a racist, a problem, I mean, this is not exactly the people you want in your party.   Gateway PunditWatch Trump s 2000 interview with Lauer here:Despite mounting criticism for Donald Trump s failure to disavow former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke s support, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton once heaped praise for late Klan leader Sen. Robert Byrd.In a video uploaded to the State Department s official YouTube page on June 28, 2010, Clinton commemorated late Sen. Byrd by saying,  Today our country has lost a true American original, my friend and mentor Robert C. Byrd. Via: Daily CallerAnd when the former KKK member, Senator Robert Byrd died, Barack Obama gave the eulogy:President Obama lauded the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd today for keeping faith with his family, his state of West Virginia and his beloved U.S. Constitution. He was a Senate icon, he was a party leader, he was an elder statesman, and he was my friend,  Obama told thousands who gathered for Byrd s funeral on the steps of the golden-domed West Virginia statehouse.

"HERE YOU GO! TRUMP CONDEMNS DAVID DUKE&Calls Him A Bigot and A Racist [Video]","Following the situation in Charlottesville, Trump was one of the very few people to call out all sides for displays of violence and bigotry: white supremacists, black supremacists, Communists, and Antifa. In short, this flurry of frustration was far from one-sided.Amidst all of the chaos, David Duke tried to link Trump to the bigotry and violence that was present in Charlottesville. This is certainly interesting considering the fact that Trump called Duke out on his own bigotry nearly seventeen years ago. In an interview with Matt Lauer in 2000, Trump condemned Duke while being questioned about his reasons for dropping out of the Reform Party primary.Trump attributed the party s  self-destructing  nature to the people involved with it, specifically Duke. When pressed on this matter by Lauer, Trump responded,  Well, you ve got David Duke just joined, a bigot, a racist, a problem, I mean, this is not exactly the people you want in your party.

"WHERE WAS MEDIA OUTRAGE After This WOMAN DELIBERATELY Plowed Car Into Las Vegas Crowd&Killing One, Injuring 35 Others? [VIDEO]","The media has been giving wall-to-wall coverage of the horrific and violent act that took place in Charlottesville, VA. By now, every American has seen the face and name of the 20-year old man, James Alex Fields, Jr., who was allegedly part of a group of white supremacists, that smashed into a large crowd of protesters on the street.JUST IN: Booking photo of James Alex Fields, Jr. @NBC29 pic.twitter.com/9nxtsvqNmt  Henry Graff (@HenryGraff) August 13, 2017As a result of the horrific accident, one woman was killed and several others were injured. Of course, the media is blaming Donald Trump for the horrific accident that he clearly had nothing to do with. As a side note, does anyone remember the media blaming former President Barack Obama when the city of Ferguson, MO was burned to the ground by Black Lives Matter rioters? Yeah, either do we.But what about the black woman who INTENTIONALLY drove her car into a crowded street on the strip in Las Vegas with her 3-year old toddler in the back seat? Does anyone even remember this happening?In December 2015, Las Vegas police say a 24 year old woman, with her 3 year old toddler in the back seat, intentionally drove her vehicle into a crowded Las Vegas strip with the intention of running people over. Here s the story MSNBC published that was written by the Associated Press. The AP doesn t waste any time attempting to gain sympathy for the driver, and in only the third paragraph of the story, the AP want to make it perfectly clear that the reader knows she may not be guilt of intentional homicide. They re quick to quote the murderer s defense lawyer who told them,  Just because she s charged, doesn t mean she s guilty From the AP article:A woman accused of intentionally plowing a car carrying her child through crowds of pedestrians on a Las Vegas Strip sidewalk is distraught and overwhelmed, her defense attorney said after she briefly appeared in court for the first time.Lakeisha Nicole Holloway, 24, pursed her lips and blinked as she was led in shackles into a courtroom. She was not asked to enter a plea but nodded to acknowledge that she would remain in jail through the holidays while both sides investigate Sunday s crash that killed an Arizona woman and injured dozens of others. This is sad and tragedy for everybody involved,  defense lawyer Joseph Abood said after the hearing, adding,  Just because she s charged, doesn t mean she s guilty. A woman with her 3-year-old daughter in the car smashed into crowds of visitors on the Las Vegas Strip, then drove to a hotel and told a valet to call 911 after killing a woman from Arizona and injuring at least 35 others, including at least five Canadians, police said.People jumped on the car and banged on its windows, but Lakeisha N. Holloway, 24, would not stop driving on the sidewalk, Clark County Sheriff Joe Lombardo told reporters. Video appeared to show the crash in front of the Paris and Planet Hollywood casino-hotels was intentional, he said.The 1996 Oldsmobile sedan was fully on the sidewalk twice Sunday night, including once when it traveled for 200 feet, police said. The child in the car was not hurt.The 24-year-old told police told she was homeless and tired, and denied using drugs or alcohol. Holloway also told police she had been unable to rest or sleep because security officers kept running her and her daughter and her car off casino properties.Here s a look at how MSNBC s parent company NBC covered the horrific Charlottesville incident yesterday. By the third paragraph in the part of the article that describes the accident, MSNBC interviews a witness from the other side of the protest (not the alleged perpetrator s defense lawyer, like in the story above) who clearly states there is no question about the motive or of the driver s guilt:  It was very clearly intentional. NBC: Described as a group of  anti-racist protesters  by a witness who took video of the crash, the group of marchers was packed close together at the end of a street near the intersection of Fourth and Water streets in downtown Charlottesville when the car struck.Brennan Gilmore, a 37-year-old who works for a start up, shot the footage and said he heard tires squealing before he saw a car build up speed and ram the crowd. It hit a number of people before plowing into the bumper of another car. It was very clearly intentional,  Gilmore told NBC News.  From the far end of the street it accelerated, slowed down right before the crowd and then slammed on the gas through the crowd sending bodies flying. And then it reversed back into the street dragging bodies and clothes. And then boom the TRUMP tie-in (which was not really a tie-in at all):Fields  mother, Samantha Bloom, told The Associated Press on Saturday night that she knew her son was attending a rally in Virginia but didn t know it was a white nationalist rally. I thought it had something to do with Trump. Trump s not a white supremacist,  Bloom told the AP. (The last sentence that includes Fields  mother s statement about Trump NOT being a white supremacist [bold], was omitted from many mainstream media sources, as it didn t fit their narrative.)In February 2017, Holloway was found mentally competent to stand trial after nearly a year committed at Lakes Crossing maximum security psychiatric facility. Holloway then pleaded not guilty in the case. Nearly 3 years later, her case has still not been tried. Lakeisha Holloway faces 71 felony counts in connection to the Dec. 20, 2015 incident that left a woman dead and injured 34 others. Her trial is scheduled to begin on Feb. 5, 2018.If you want to learn more about this case, you ll have to look for updates in local Las Vegas news sources. You won t likely find it being covered by the mainstream media. ",politics,"Aug 13, 2017"

Mike Huckabee told Fox News host Judge Jeanine Pirro that he has a  special repulsion  for white supremacists and that Trump did the right thing in his statements about Charlottesville. It s part because I m white,  he elaborated.  It s part because I have seen this evil and hateful attitude that elevates some people above others. And as a believing Christian, I m especially offended because anybody who believes The Bible, especially the gospels, will have to accept that there is no way that God is a respecter of persons- as scripture makes clear, He doesn t love some people more than others because of their color, because of their affiliation, even with Him. He mentioned that because he believe in the gospels that  every person has equal worth,  that makes him pro-life.Pirro asked Huckabee if the outrage over the president s remarks are just  Trump haters  who   will look for any reason to dump on  him. Well it seems like a lot of them are, I don t know what they expect the president to do,  Huckabee responded.  At the time that he made the comment, the driver of the car had not even been identified. That s exactly right!  Pirro exclaimed. And so what is he supposed to say?  Huckabee continued.  Is he supposed to do what Barack Obama used to do and jump to conclusion and make a decision like he did in Ferguson. Missouri, which turned out to be totally untrue? The president has to be careful in taking steps.

"New Report Shows 3.5 MILLION MORE ADULTS Registered To Vote Than Are Alive&Is This Why Leftist Media Predicted Hillary Would Win? [VIDEO]","WATCH the euphoric reaction of Clinton crony and ABC host George Stephanopoulos discuss the probability of Hillary winning the presidential election against candidate Trump with Nate Silver. According to Stephaopoulos, is rarely incorrect in his predictions. Was Silver considering the effect voter fraud would have on our elections that appears to be almost exclusively favoring Democrats?FAST FORWARD TO August, 2017, as America witnesses one report after anohter of unbelievable voter fraud and/or major voter discrepancies across several states in America.  Americans are finally starting to understand how the Democrats, and their allies in the media were so certain that Hillary would win against the much more popular candidate Donald J. Trump:National Review   Some 3.5 million more people are registered to vote in the U.S. than are alive among America s adult citizens. Such staggering inaccuracy is an engraved invitation to voter fraud.The Election Integrity Project of Judicial Watch   a Washington-based legal-watchdog group   analyzed data from the U.S. Census Bureau s 2011 2015 American Community Survey and last month s statistics from the federal Election Assistance Commission. The latter included figures provided by 38 states. According to Judicial Watch, eleven states gave the EAC insufficient or questionable information. Pennsylvania s legitimate numbers place it just below the over-registration threshold.My tabulation of Judicial Watch s state-by-state results yielded 462 counties where the registration rate exceeded 100 percent. There were 3,551,760 more people registered to vote than adult U.S. citizens who inhabit these counties. That s enough over-registered voters to populate a ghost-state about the size of Connecticut,  Judicial Watch attorney Robert Popper told me.Take a look at the margin in battle ground states Trump won in 2016, in which Electoral College votes can be decided by incredibly narrow margins. Consider the multitude of ghost voters in:Colorado: 159,373Florida: 100,782Iowa: 31,077Michigan: 225,235New Hampshire: 8,211North Carolina: 189,721Virginia: 89,979(For a deeper dive into these data, please download my spreadsheet here.)President Donald J. Trump s supporters might be intrigued to learn that Hillary Clinton s margins of victory in Colorado (136,386) and New Hampshire (2,736) were lower than the numbers of ghost voters in those states. Clinton s fans should know that Trump won Michigan (10,704) and North Carolina (173,315) by fewer ballots than ghost voters in those states.It s past time to exorcise ghost voters from the polls.Watch Barack Obama criticize Donald Trump for questioning the integrity of the vote: ",politics,"Aug 12, 2017"

Maybe he should grow up and have a decent plate on his car. The Trump-bashing is childish and this guy was a teacher!What does this license plate say?

"THESE 11 GOP SENATORS Tweeted Support for McConnell&Primary Them!","Arrogant and smug is what we d call McConnell when he spoke to a group telling them Trump has  excessive expectations  of government Unbelievable!After 7 years of promises, the Senate leader can t do a thing McConnell should take the blame for the do-nothing Senate!Speaking at a Rotary Club gathering in Kentucky on Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vented about how President Donald Trump s lack of political experience has led to him setting  excessive expectations  for legislative priorities.McConnell, R-Ky., told the group in Florence that he found it  extremely irritating  that Congress has earned the reputation of not accomplishing anything. Part of the reason I think that the storyline is that we haven t done much is because, in part, the president and others have set these early timelines about things need to be done by a certain point,  said McConnell, a Republican and the state s senior senator.Trump, a political newcomer, as McConnell noted, has a habit of declaring progress on major priorities that do not necessarily reflect the reality of lawmaking.For example, as the House was in the midst of negotiations about its Obamacare replacement bill in February, Trump announced that Congress was in the  final stages  of its bill and said it would be ready for  submitting  in March. While the House bill was unveiled in March, that chamber didn t vote on it until May, and health care votes continued until the end of July.That sort of disconnect has led to Trump s expressing disappointment when bills   chief among them health care reform   fail to end up on his desk, even though, as with health care, the political reality indicated all along how difficult it was going to be to pass legislation. Our new president, of course, has not been in this line of work before. And I think he had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process,  McConnell told the group.  So part of the reason I think people feel we re underperforming is because too many artificial deadlines   unrelated to the reality of the complexity of legislating   may not have been fully understood. President Trump tweeted back to McConnell: GET BACK TO WORK! Here s the list of Republican Senators who went against President Trump: PRIMARY THEM!

"SKETCHY FIRM BEHIND SALACIOUS ALLEGATIONS Against Trump Tries to Pull a Fast One on Senate Judiciary Committee","Remember Fusion GPS (please see our previous report on this below)? They are the opposition research firm behind the Trump  golden showers  dossier that attempted to embarrass the president with untrue stories of sexual escapades. Well, Fusion GPS had been ordered to turn over the dossier to the Senate Judiciary Committee late Wednesday but when they turned them over it was clear Fusion GPS was trying to pull a fast one on the Senate: The committee is reviewing the production received late this afternoon from Mr. Simpson, but virtually all of the documents appear to be merely news clippings rather than records of Fusion s substantive communications. The paltry document production escalates the standoff between Fusion GPS and the Judiciary Committee, which is chaired by Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley.After Simpson declined an invitation to testify before the committee last month, Grassley issued a subpoena to compel him to appear. But the subpoena was withdrawn after Simpson, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, said he would voluntarily meet in a closed session with committee staff.A date for that meeting has not been set. WHY NOT???Last month, the committee requested records from Fusion GPS, the Trump campaign, Donald Trump Jr. and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort as part of its investigation into Russian meddling in the election.The Trump campaign gave the committee 20,000 pages of records last week while Trump Jr. and Manafort produced 250 pages and 400 pages of records, respectively.The committee is one of three congressional panels investigating Russia-related matters, including the dossier and the June 9, 2016 Trump Tower meeting held between Trump Jr. and a Russian attorney linked to Fusion GPS.In its request to Fusion, the Judiciary Committee asked for contracts that the firm signed for its work on the dossier.Fusion was initially hired to investigate Trump in Sept. 2015 by an unidentified Republican donor who opposed the real estate mogul. After Trump ascended to the GOP nomination, the donor dropped the project. But Fusion soon found a Democratic ally of Hillary Clinton s   also still unidentified   to continue the research. Fusion hired Christopher Steele, a former MI6 agent, to conduct the investigation.Fusion and Steele s firm, Orbis Business Intelligence, have worked together on various projects since 2010.The committee also asked Fusion to produce contracts and communications regarding its work against the Magnitsky Act, a sanctions law opposed by the Russian government.Who exactly was paying Fusion GPS for all of its projects against Trump?

During the testimony the origin of the Fusion GPS  Russian Dossier  was discussed (please see our previous report on this below). The Hermitage Capital CEO revealed that the Russian government actually paid Fusion GPS to create the fake  Golden Shower  propaganda dossier on candidate Trump. Here s the kicker: That same dossier was used by the FBI in June/July 2016 to generate the FISA surveillance warrants against the Trump campaign.Yes, that means FBI Director Comey used the fake dossier  commissioned by Russia to attack Trump, as the framework to launch his FBI investigation into candidate Donald Trump and Russian collusion.Soooo why is Mueller still investigating President Trump?Entire video of Testimony Below:Graham s questioning begins at the 48:40 point:Foreign Agent Registration Requirements William Bowder, a Russian market investor, testifies at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on foreign agent registration requirements, as well as what he knows about Natalia Veslnitskaya, a Russian attorney who met with Donald Trump, Jr. in 2016.

How is it okay for Senator John McCain to actively seek dirt on a sitting president, but not okay for Donald Trump Jr. (who is NOT a government official) to meet with a Russian lawyer in an attempt to discover potential dirt on presidential candidate Hillary Clinton?Sen. John McCain commented on Tuesday about Donald Trump Jr. s meeting with the Russian lawyer. How serious do you think this particular shoe is?  Raju asked, referring to Donald Trump Jr. s meeting with Kremlin-linked lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya after being promised dirt on Clinton that was reportedly part of a Russian government effort. I don t know. But it s certainly another shoe that s dropped that needs to be pursued and looked at,  McCain said.  TPMWatch RINO Senator John McCain express his concern overt the seriousness of Donald Trump Jr. s meeting with the Russian lawyer about the lifting US sanctions on Russian adoption. It s curious that the reporter never asked McCain about his efforts to smear our president with a unsubstantiated dirty dossier from an ex-spy:Before we go any further into the messy details of John McCain s international dealings to find dirt on our sitting president, it s worth mentioning that as far as we know, no one was murdered as a result of Donald Trump Jr. s meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya, who entered the US without a visa under  extraordinary circumstances  thanks to the efforts of Barack Obama s DOJ. The same cannot be said about McCain s dealings with the  dirty dossier  on Trump. Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya is also said to have ties to Fusion GPS, the sketchy secretive Washington firm that commissioned the dubious intelligence dossier on Donald Trump.According to the Daily Caller   The Russian lawyer who offered Donald Trump Jr. damaging information about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton reportedly has ties to the opposition research firm that commissioned the dossier on President Donald Trump.When the June 2016 meeting took place, Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya was in New York to defend Prevezon, a Russian holding firm accused of laundering money for corrupt Russian businessmen. Veselnitskaya had been working on the case for years with assistance from Fusion GPS, the opposition research firm that compiled the Trump dossier.Fusion GPS denied any knowledge of, or role in, facilitating the meeting between Veselnitskaya and Trump Jr.According to The Sun: A FORMER KGB spy chief suspected of helping Brit spook Christopher Steele compile the Trump  dirty dossier  has been found dead in his car under mysterious circumstances.Oleg Erovinkin, described as a key source behind the widely discredited document, was found dead in the back of his car in Moscow on Boxing Day.Today, the Daily Mail reports: Sen. John McCain said he did  what any citizen would do  in turning over the dirty dossier, which contained unconfirmed secrets about the president-elect, over to the FBI.The Guardian charted the path of how the dossier came to be and how it was that McCain got his hands on the controversial documents.In turn, that firm outsourced the research to a  retired western European former counter-intelligence official, with a long history of dealing with the shadow world of Moscow s spooks and siloviki (securocrats),  explained the Guardian.Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal identified the ex-spy as Christopher Steele.The Guardian pointed out that just because a Democrat was willing to pay for the information that didn t mean that said Democrat was Hillary Clinton s campaign or the Democratic National Committee.Sometimes donors seek out this information in order to ensure they ve made a sound investment.***Yeah okay!***The contractor, who the Guardian didn t name, but the Wall Street Journal identified as Steele, reportedly found the information that he dug up to be concerning. He and another ex-British diplomat, Christopher Burrows, run their own company, Orbis Business Intelligence. If the allegations were real, their implications were overwhelming,  the Guardian wrote.On November 18, at the Halifax International Security Forum, McCain was introduced to a  former senior western diplomat  who had set eyes on the documents and knew who put them together, telling the Arizona Republican that the individual was  highly reliable. That man can now be named as Sir Andrew Wood, British ambassador to Moscow from 1995 to 2000.Wood told the Independent that he had met McCain, spoken to him about Trump, and about the potential for him to be compromised.In a carefully nuanced statement he said:  Yes I did meet Senator McCain and his aides at the conference. We spoke about the kind of activities the Russians can be engaged in. We also spoke about how Mr Trump may find himself in a position where there could be an attempt to blackmail him with Kompromat [a Russian term for compromising material] and claims that there were audio and video tapes in existence.   He added:  I would like to stress that I did not pass on any dossier to Senator McCain or anyone else and I did not see a dossier at the time. I do know Christopher Steele and in my view he is very professional and thorough in what he does. He did not however address whether he told McCain there was a dossier   and how to get it.Clearly, somebody did.From there, McCain dispatched a  trusted emissary  who flew across the Atlantic to meet the source of the documents at an airport that the Guardian did not name.The aide was instructed to look for a man with a copy of the Financial Times and that s how the individuals met, with the source taking McCain s emissary back to his house and giving the American a copy of the documents.Within 24 hours, the dossier was in Washington, though the contents of the file couldn t be verified without an investigation.  McCain, the Guardian said, was worried that his actions might be interpreted as revenge for some of the controversial comments Trump made about him   such as knocking the fact that the longtime senator had been a prisoner of war.However, McCain decided to hand over the documents to FBI Director James Comey on December 9. Upon examination of the contents, and unable to make a judgment about their accuracy, I delivered the information to the Director of the FBI,  McCain said Wednesday in a statement about that matter. That has been the extent of my contact with the FBI or any other government agency regarding this issue,  McCain said.For entire story: Daily MailRead more: CT",politics,"Aug 11, 2017"
"HOW NEWSWEEK ACCUSES Melania and Ivanka Of Sending Sexual Signals Will Even Make Trump-Haters Laugh","The publication that just can t seem to get over Hillary s loss to President Trump has sunk to a new low. And yes, apparently that is possible Comparing our First Lady and our President s daughter to prostitutes?  Really? Perhaps no one told Newsweek that both of these beautiful, and yes, feminine women, happened to be successful businesswomen long before Donald Trump ever decided to run for President Newsweek attacked President Donald Trump s female relatives for wearing high heels in public in a piece published Thursday, saying it showed they were subservient to men. Melania, Ivanka, and Ivana Trump Wear High Heels, a Symbol of Everything That Is Beautiful and Horrifying About Them,  read the headline. The female consorts of the Leader of the Free World do not set foot in public without first molding their arches into the supranatural curve that Mattel toy designers once devised for Barbie s plastic feet,  the author complained.Newsweek argued that high heels are designed primarily to attract men, not for the comfort of the women wearing them. So to deconstruct why Trump women wear high heels: They are just buying into traditional binary views of male and female,  British psychologist Paul Morris opined. High heels thrust out the buttocks and arch the back into a natural mammalian courting,  an American anthropologist agreed.  Rats do it, sheep do it   lions do it, dogs do it. It is a naturally sexy posture that men immediately see as sexual readiness. [Heels] are a  come-hither  signal. When women wear high heels at work, they send sexual signals that should be avoided if they want to be taken seriously,  she said.Newsweek further noted that the first women to wear high heels were  Italian prostitutes in the 17th century  and that  the high heel was a staple of Victorian porn. Stiletto pumps are the ultimate test of a certain type of femininity. They signal the taut combination of power and weakness that conservative women must cultivate in order to survive among ideologues who are crafting our tax-free  Handmaid s Tale  future,  Newsweek concluded.

You, our nation, our world, is experiencing a black Friday,  Rev. Bill Shillady wrote to Clinton on Nov. 9, 2016, CNN reported.  Our hope is that Sunday is coming. But it might well be hell for a while. On Good Friday every year, Christians observe the crucifixion and death of Jesus, who they believe to be the Son of God. Two days later, they celebrate Easter Sunday, which marks the Resurrection of Jesus and the triumph over sin.One day after Clinton s stunning defeat at the hands of Trump, Shillady wrote that  life is filled with a lot of Fridays  and Good Friday  represented the day that everything fell apart. Today, you are experiencing a Friday. Your Friday is what happened in the last few weeks and last night in the tragic loss. But Sunday is coming!  Shillady wrote.Shillady went on to write about the suffering of Jesus for the world s sins and how his faith in God gave him  the grace and peace to submit to Friday. Friday is finished,  he wrote.  Sunday is coming. Death will be shattered. Hope will be restored. But first, we must live through the darkness and seeming hopelessness of Friday. Clinton, a Methodist, has reportedly discussed making her own spirituality more public, and Shillady has said she would make a  great pastor.

"WOW! FORMER NSA EXPERTS REPORT: Russians DID NOT Hack DNC Servers&It Was A LEAK&An INSIDE JOB By Someone With Access To DNCs System","It is now a year since the Democratic National Committee s mail system was compromised a year since events in the spring and early summer of 2016 were identified as remote hacks and, in short order, attributed to Russians acting in behalf of Donald Trump. A great edifice has been erected during this time.President Trump, members of his family, and numerous people around him stand accused of various corruptions and extensive collusion with Russians. Half a dozen simultaneous investigations proceed into these matters. Last week news broke that Special Counsel Robert Mueller had convened a grand jury, which issued its first subpoenas on August 3. Allegations of treason are common; prominent political figures and many media cultivate a case for impeachment.The president s ability to conduct foreign policy, notably but not only with regard to Russia, is now crippled. Forced into a corner and having no choice, Trump just signed legislation imposing severe new sanctions on Russia and European companies working with it on pipeline projects vital to Russia s energy sector. Striking this close to the core of another nation s economy is customarily considered an act of war, we must not forget. In retaliation, Moscow has announced that the United States must cut its embassy staff by roughly two-thirds. All sides agree that relations between the United States and Russia are now as fragile as they were during some of the Cold War s worst moments. To suggest that military conflict between two nuclear powers inches ever closer can no longer be dismissed as hyperbole.All this was set in motion when the DNC s mail server was first violated in the spring of 2016 and by subsequent assertions that Russians were behind that  hack  and another such operation, also described as a Russian hack, on July 5. These are the foundation stones of the edifice just outlined. The evolution of public discourse in the year since is worthy of scholarly study: Possibilities became allegations, and these became probabilities. Then the probabilities turned into certainties, and these evolved into what are now taken to be established truths. By my reckoning, it required a few days to a few weeks to advance from each of these stages to the next. This was accomplished via the indefensibly corrupt manipulations of language repeated incessantly in our leading media.There was no hack of the Democratic National Committee s system on July 5 last year not by the Russians, not by anyone else.Hard science now demonstrates it was a leak a download executed locally with a memory key or a similarly portable data-storage device.In short, it was an inside job by someone with access to the DNC s system. This casts serious doubt on the initial  hack,  as alleged, that led to the very consequential publication of a large store of documents on WikiLeaks last summer.Forensic investigations of documents made public two weeks prior to the July 5 leak by the person or entity known as Guccifer 2.0 show that they were fraudulent: Before Guccifer posted them they were adulterated by cutting and pasting them into a blank template that had Russian as its default language. Guccifer took responsibility on June 15 for an intrusion the DNC reported on June 14 and professed to be a WikiLeaks source claims essential to the official narrative implicating Russia in what was soon cast as an extensive hacking operation. To put the point simply, forensic science now devastates this narrative.This article is based on an examination of the documents these forensic experts and intelligence analysts have produced, notably the key papers written over the past several weeks, as well as detailed interviews with many of those conducting investigations and now drawing conclusions from them. Before proceeding into this material, several points bear noting.Qualified experts working independently of one another began to examine the DNC case immediately after the July 2016 events. Prominent among these is a group comprising former intelligence officers, almost all of whom previously occupied senior positions. Veteran Intelligence Professionals for Sanity (VIPS), founded in 2003, now has 30 members, including a few associates with backgrounds in national-security fields other than intelligence. The chief researchers active on the DNC case are four: William Binney, formerly the NSA s technical director for world geopolitical and military analysis and designer of many agency programs now in use; Kirk Wiebe, formerly a senior analyst at the NSA s SIGINT Automation Research Center; Edward Loomis, formerly technical director in the NSA s Office of Signal Processing; and Ray McGovern, an intelligence analyst for nearly three decades and formerly chief of the CIA s Soviet Foreign Policy Branch. Most of these men have decades of experience in matters concerning Russian intelligence and the related technologies. This article reflects numerous interviews with all of them conducted in person, via Skype, or by telephone.The customary VIPS format is an open letter, typically addressed to the president. The group has written three such letters on the DNC incident, all of which were first published by Robert Parry at www.consortiumnews.com. Here is the latest, dated July 24; it blueprints the forensic work this article explores in detail. They have all argued that the hack theory is wrong and that a locally executed leak is the far more likely explanation. In a letter to Barack Obama dated January 17, three days before he left office, the group explained that the NSA s known programs are fully capable of capturing all electronic transfers of data.  We strongly suggest that you ask NSA for any evidence it may have indicating that the results of Russian hacking were given to WikiLeaks,  the letter said.  If NSA cannot produce such evidence and quickly this would probably mean it does not have any. Forensicator s first decisive findings, made public in the paper dated July 9, concerned the volume of the supposedly hacked material and what is called the transfer rate the time a remote hack would require. The metadata established several facts in this regard with granular precision: On the evening of July 5, 2016, 1,976 megabytes of data were downloaded from the DNC s server. The operation took 87 seconds. This yields a transfer rate of 22.7 megabytes per second.These statistics are matters of record and essential to disproving the hack theory. No Internet service provider, such as a hacker would have had to use in mid-2016, was capable of downloading data at this speed. Compounding this contradiction, Guccifer claimed to have run his hack from Romania, which, for numerous reasons technically called delivery overheads, would slow down the speed of a hack even further from maximum achievable speeds.In addition, there is the adulteration of the documents Guccifer 2.0 posted on June 15, when he made his first appearance. This came to light when researchers penetrated what Folden calls Guccifer s top layer of metadata and analyzed what was in the layers beneath. They found that the first five files Guccifer made public had each been run, via ordinary cut-and-paste, through a single template that effectively immersed them in what could plausibly be cast as Russian fingerprints. They were not: The Russian markings were artificially inserted prior to posting.  It s clear,  another forensics investigator self-identified as HET, wrote in a report on this question,  that metadata was deliberately altered and documents were deliberately pasted into a Russianified [W]ord document with Russian language settings and style headings. VIPS has assembled a chronology that imposes a persuasive logic on the complex succession of events just reviewed. It is this:On June 12 last year, Julian Assange announced that WikiLeaks had and would publish documents pertinent to Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign.On June 14, CrowdStrike, a cyber-security firm hired by the DNC, announced, without providing evidence, that it had found malware on DNC servers and had evidence that Russians were responsible for planting it.On June 15, Guccifer 2.0 first appeared, took responsibility for the  hack  reported on June 14 and claimed to be a WikiLeaks source. It then posted the adulterated documents just described.On July 5, Guccifer again claimed he had remotely hacked DNC servers, and the operation was instantly described as another intrusion attributable to Russia. Virtually no media questioned this account.It does not require too much thought to read into this sequence. With his June 12 announcement, Assange effectively put the DNC on notice that it had a little time, probably not much, to act preemptively against the imminent publication of damaging documents. Did the DNC quickly conjure Guccifer from thin air to create a cyber-saboteur whose fingers point to Russia? There is no evidence of this one way or the other, but emphatically it is legitimate to pose the question in the context of the VIPS chronology. WikiLeaks began publishing on July 22. By that time, the case alleging Russian interference in the 2016 elections process was taking firm root. In short order Assange would be written down as a  Russian agent. See Wikileaks founder Julian Assange s interview about the possibility of Seth Rich being the DNC leaker near bottom of the article. Behind the ICA lie other indefensible realities. The FBI has never examined the DNC s computer servers an omission that is beyond preposterous. It has instead relied on the reports produced by Crowdstrike, a firm that drips with conflicting interests well beyond the fact that it is in the DNC s employ. Dmitri Alperovitch, its co-founder and chief technology officer, is on the record as vigorously anti-Russian. He is a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, which suffers the same prejudice. Problems such as this are many. We continue to stand by our report,  CrowdStrike said, upon seeing the VIPS blueprint of the investigation. CrowdStrike argues that by July 5 all malware had been removed from the DNC s computers. But the presence or absence of malware by that time is entirely immaterial, because the event of July 5 is proven to have been a leak and not a hack. Given that malware has nothing to do with leaks, CrowdStrike s logic appears to be circular.Click HERE for the entire THE NATION article.  h/t Gateway Pundit Wikileaks founder Julian Assange has strongly hinted that the source for the DNC emails he released was Seth Rich. In this interview with Julian Assange, he seems to suggest on Dutch television program Nieuwsuur that Seth Rich was the source for the Wikileaks-exposed DNC emails and was murdered:",politics,"Aug 10, 2017"
"PRICELESS! TRUMPS ANSWER About Putin Firing U.S. Embassy Employees Will Make Your Day! [Video]","This is priceless! President Trump just gave the best response ever to a reporter s question! He said he wanted to thank Russian President Vladimir Putin for reducing his payroll by firing U.S. embassy staff in Moscow. Hysterical and so quick! Watch how Trump doesn t skip a beat with his response:After Sanctions on Russia were put in place in July, Putin ordered 755 embassy personnel out of Russia.President Trump was asked today during a press conference what he thought of the firing. His response was quick and decisive. He said he wanted to thank Putin for the firing: No. I want to thank him, because we re trying to cut down on payroll. And as far as I m concerned, I m very thankful that he let go of a large number of people because now we have a smaller payroll. He continued:  There s no real reason for them to go back. So I greatly appreciate the fact that they have been able to cut our payroll for the United States. We ll save a lot of money. AWESOME!",politics,"Aug 10, 2017"
"OKLAHOMA Supreme Court Rules Punishing Smokers With Cigarette Tax Unconstitutional&Lawmakers Forced To Fill SHOCKING Hole In State Budget","OKLAHOMA CITY   The Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled the cigarette tax passed late in the legislative session unconstitutional Thursday morning.The tax was expected to bring in more than $200 million of revenue for the state budget by tacking on an extra $1.50 per pack of cigarettes. The budget was planned and passed assuming the tax would hold.The tax was originally passed after the deadline for revenue raising bills, but Republican lawmakers tried to eke it through as a fee. A tax would have required a three-fourths majority to pass. Justices on Thursday ruled that, because the funds raised could be used for non-smoking related programs, the bill could not go through as a regulatory fee.The State now has a week to seek a rehearing. If it does not, the ruling is final.Gov. Mary Fallin issued a response to the Supreme Court s ruling:I am disappointed to hear the Supreme Court struck down the smoking cessation fee, but I certainly respect the justices  authority. I will be discussing with legislative leaders from both parties the need to address the $215 million shortfall this will create for the Department of Human Services, the Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services and the Oklahoma Health Care Authority, the three agencies that received the bulk of the money that was to be generated by the cessation fee.These agencies and the people they serve cannot sustain the kind of cuts that will occur if we do not find a solution. My belief is we will have to come into special session to address this issue.House Minority Leader Scott Inman released the following statement on the ruling:Once again, Governor Fallin and Republican legislators have failed Oklahoma. My caucus and I sounded every alarm bell we could to stop this from happening, yet here we are, just as we warned.Today, I m urging Governor Fallin to call for a special session and for Republican leaders to come together with myself and Sen. Sparks and draft a truly bipartisan and constitutional budget plan that will help to restore, reinvest in, and rebuild Oklahoma.With our state agencies facing more budget cuts and with even more rulings waiting, the time is now to work out a budget agreement before a special session of the legislature. By coming together now and putting a plan in place, we can save precious time and taxpayer dollars to fix the mess that their failed leadership has put us in because of their failed policies to cut taxes for the wealthy and well-connected.This cigarette tax was just a Band-Aid put on their gaping wound of a budget hole. Schools are down to 4-day weeks, hospitals are closing down, and public safety is in a crisis, not because cigarettes are too cheap, but because Republican policies benefitting their donors have failed us.For entire story: News 9",politics,"Aug 10, 2017"
"HA! WHAT MAXINE WATERS Says We Must Give North Korea to Keep the Peace [Video]","Maxine Waters told a TMZ reporter that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson should put threats aside and appease North Korea by giving them the  things that they re asking for . She responded as she was leaving an upscale steakhouse in Beverly Hills. She told the reporter that we can t afford to go to war. Pretty rich for a person who wants to spend unlimited amounts on everything else BUT what s MOST important to the U.S DEFENSE! I want us to be very careful, very alert to what is happening and to avoid war. I think we can do this with some diplomacy, but we have got to have Tillerson, who is our secretary of state, get those positions filled for deputy, for assistant, so that we can engage with North Korea. I think there s some things that they want from us, and we have to find out whether or not we can work with them on the things that they re asking for. This is exactly what Obama did for 8 years! It s exactly why we re in this position today!Read more: WFB",politics,"Aug 10, 2017"
