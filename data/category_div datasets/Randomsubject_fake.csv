" John McCain Wanted Another 74 Twitter Followers, But His Plan Backfired Miserably (TWEETS)","All Senator John McCain wanted to achieve on the morning of Monday, December 4 was to hit that magic milestone of three million Twitter followers, a goal of which he was just 74 followers shy. So what was McCain s approach to gaining those new followers? Simple, he would go on Twitter and rely on word-of-mouth, how could that possibly fail?We're only 74 Twitter followers away from 3M   spread the word & help us reach this big milestone!  John McCain (@SenJohnMcCain) December 4, 2017There was just one little thing Senator McCain had forgotten to factor in   His significantly waning popularity since he voted for the Republican tax bill. Being the Republican Senator for Arizona, some may have seen this as him just batting for his own team, but let s not forget that John McCain was one of the few glimmers of hope as he was also one of the only Republicans that has been openly critical of President Trump and this is a terrible tax bill.Not only will the new tax measures raise taxes on those earning less than $75,000 per annum, it would also take healthcare from 13 million Americans and raise the national debt by almost $1.5 trillion dollars over the coming decade! To add insult to injury, the 479-page bill wasn t even completed when it was released on Friday night, with some pages crossed out and others with hand-written amendments in the margins. Furthermore, nobody even had a chance to read it when they were forced to vote on it, but that didn t sway McCain and the bill somehow managed to pass the Senate.UPDATE: Senate Republicans are so desperate to pass their tax bill tonight that they're now making handwritten changes to their already handwritten changes Seriously. pic.twitter.com/KQfW7bOyk1  Senator Dick Durbin (@SenatorDurbin) December 2, 2017Some people had grown to believe that Senator McCain wasn t too bad for a Republican, but when he shocked everyone and voted in favor of the new tax bill, one where 13 million taxpayers will lose their healthcare but still subsidize his treatment for brain cancer, he proved he was no different and people decided to revolt. So when McCain put out the plea for another 74 followers to reach the three million mark, Twitter-users instead instigated a massive unfollow campaign using the hashtag #UnfollowMcCain, costing him hundreds of followers every minute.Over 5,000 people have unfollowed you since you sent this this two hours ago.One reason is you because you   a man undergoing cancer treatment   voted to strip $25 BILLION dollars from the part of Medicare which pays for CANCER TREATMENT.#unfollowmccain https://t.co/gWl6KsAaLE  Mikel Jollett (@Mikel_Jollett) December 4, 2017I m happy to report that @SenJohnMcCain has lost more than 10,000 followers since I posted the below tweet.

" Trump Wakes Up To Scream At Black People After Hurling A Racial Slur Yesterday","Donald Trump thinks if he rage-tweets about NFL players who choose to kneel instead of stand during the national anthem as a form of silent protest against racial injustice and police brutality, it will all go away but by doing that, he inadvertently highlights that there is a problem. The former reality show star dropped a racial slur yesterday in front of Native American heroes, then today, he jumped on Twitter to yell at black people. We see a pattern here. At least 24 players kneeling this weekend at NFL stadiums that are now having a very hard time filling up,  Trump screamed at the world.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) but this time he took things to the edge then crossed the line. On Monday, Trump referred to Warren as  Pocahontas  at an event honoring Native American  code talkers  who fought in World War II. Trump was literally surrounded by Native Americans when he hurled the slur. The chief. He s the general and the chief,  Trump said during the White House event, in reference to White House chief of staff John Kelly.  I said, how good were these code talkers? He said, sir, you have no idea. You have no idea how great they were, what they have done for this country and the strength and the bravery and the love for the country. So that was the ultimate statement from General Kelly, the importance,  Trump continued.  And I just want to thank you because you re very, very special people.

" Breitbart Editor To CNN Host: A Song By Ringo Starr Proves Roy Moore Isnt A Pedo (VIDEO)","A Breitbart News editor tried to use a song Ringo Starr covered in order to make claims appear to be false that controversial Alabama GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore engaged in sexual misconduct with teenage girls when he was in his thirties. On Monday, Breitbart editor Joel Pollak told host Chris Cuomo on CNN s  New Day  that Starr released  You re Sixteen (You re Beautiful, You re Mine),  a cover of a song that was actually written by Robert B. Sherman and Richard M. Sherman and performed by Johnny Burnette. The song was also featured in  American Graffiti. He was 30-something at the time singing about a 16-year-old,  Pollak said.  You want to take away Ringo Starr s achievement? You can t be serious,  Cuomo shot back.  I m dead serious.

" Trumpsters Launch Insane Conspiracy Theory About The Boot On John McCains Foot","Senator John McCain (R-AZ) was treated at Walter Reed Medical Center over the weekend for a minor tear in his right Achilles tendon, according to his website which further explains that he has returned to work in the Senate and will be wearing a walking boot until his injured tendon is fully healed.

So, far right-wing sites such as Gateway Pundit, a blog which was gifted with White House credentials (!), wrote up the breaking news about the boot-switch.Comments poured in the thread under the post, many speculating that McCain is under house arrest and wearing an ankle monitor.

" Trump Admin. Tosses Out Another Obama Rule  His Sons Can Be Even Worse Douchebags Now","President Donald Trump has overturned another Obama-era legislation, this time the 2014 ban on trophy hunting permits, particularly those of elephants killed in Zimbabwe and Zambia, a US Fish and Wildlife Service official has confirmed. Trump s sons, Don Jr., and Eric, love being trophy-hunting douchebags and this will allow them to be even more blatant about it.Don Jr., has hunted elephants before, and elephants are listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act. That exact act also contained a provision that allows for the granting of permits for the trophy-hunting of elephants if the hunters can prove that the demise of the singular animal in question helped benefit the conservation of the entire species. It s unlikely the Trump sons care about conservation, and only about their own glory and bragging rights.Nevertheless, a spokesman for Fish and Wildlife said,  Legal, well-regulated sport hunting as part of a sound management program can benefit the conservation of certain species by providing incentives to local communities to conserve the species and by putting much-needed revenue back into conservation. Despite large-scale conservation efforts, the wild elephant population in Africa plummeted 30% overall between 2007 and 2014 and by as much as 75% in some areas as a result of ivory poaching, but that is just the tip of the iceberg. Prior to European colonization in the early 20th century, it is estimated that the wild elephant population in Africa was approximately 20 million, but dropped to 1.7 million by 1979. That number looks even more bleak when at last count in 2016 there were only just over 352,000 of the animals remaining on Africa s savanna in a survey where Namibia did not release any figures and surveys in South Sudan and the Central African Republic were postponed due to armed conflict.Last year, 182 countries signed an agreement to end the legal ivory trade in domestic markets, however, Zimbabwe is one of few that has tried to have that ban lifted and soon they may be successful with the help of President Trump. This new change would only apply to Zimbabwe and Zambia, but with Robert Mugabe s recent removal and the military seizing control of Zimbabwe, they have bigger issues to deal with at the moment.It makes you wonder why President Trump would be so interested in elephant poaching. Is it another distraction, this time from the possibility of Zimbabwe falling into a constitutional crisis? Could it be because he just likes the look of ivory in Trump Tower?Or is it simply because Trumps just miss slaughtering endangered wildlife for the sheer pleasure of it?Figures. pic.twitter.com/7LrFJeqaIY  Snarkar?ni  ?

" WATCH: Delusional Trump Fans Lash Out At Fox Host For Reporting Facts Of Uranium One Deal","Clearly, Trump supporters want Fox News to lie to them.Because when Fox News host Shep Smith fact-checked Donald Trump s accusations against Hillary Clinton in regards to the Uranium One deal with Russia, they lost their shit.Smith thoroughly debunked Republican claims that Hillary Clinton approved the deal in a pay-to-play scam during her time as Secretary of State back in 2010.First, the deal had to be approved by a committee of nine agency heads, who unanimously approved.Second, the State Department was represented by an assistant who says Clinton did not intervene.Third, the Uranium One deal stipulates that the uranium must be sold to civilian reactor operators in the United States, which blows Trump s claim that Hillary gave 20 percent of our uranium to Russia out of the water.Fourth, one man gave the Clinton Foundation all but $4 million of the $140 million donated by nine individuals associated with Uranium One. And that one man had already sold his stake in the company years before in 2007, well before Clinton even thought about being Secretary of State. And long before Barack Obama became president to make her Secretary of State.And, finally, Clinton had no power to veto or approve the deal herself.So, that means conservatives have no case against Clinton, effectively neutering any effort by the Justice Department to appoint a special prosecutor since doing so is contingent on the facts. And the facts support Clinton. So much so, that any court would laugh the obviously manufactured charges out of court.Here s the video via YouTube.In response, Trump supporters threw a temper tantrum and called for Fox to fire Smith for reporting the facts.You need to get that hack @ShepNewsTeam out of Fox.

" This 4-Year Old Tweet From Donald Trump Shows Us Hes AT LEAST As Perverted As Roy Moore","After Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein was finally publicly outed after decades of alleged sexual abuses toward women, a #metoo hashtag formed and a dam broke. Suddenly it seemed that every time we turned on our computers, every time we received a phone alert, it was yet another man outed as an abuser.The worst of the worst of sexual abusers, though, are those who abuse children. Roy Moore, the right-wing Christian nut-job who s running for Senate in Alabama has been accused of doing just that. Five women have now come forward alleging that Moore  dated  them and worse while they were teens and he was in his 30s.This all began almost a year to the day after an audio tape of Donald Trump bragging about how he s such a big star he can just grab women s pussies. Is it possible, though, that Trump is as bad, if not worse, than Moore?While liberals and Democrats have decried the alleged abusers, regardless of ideology or party affiliation, Republicans have taken a *shall we say* more nuanced stance when it comes to Moore. They have invoked the Bible, saying that the Virgin Mary was a teenager when Jesus was born. Of course, much like they forget the  well regulated militia  part of the Second Amendment, these men who would slut shame their own sisters if they were Democrats who wanted birth control, suddenly forgot the first part of Mary s moniker. They also defended Moore by saying that he was just a fragile young buck of 32, who couldn t have possibly known better, while his alleged victims were well on their way to adulthood at 14 and 16.Donald Trump has been surprisingly mum about the Moore allegations, but spokesperson Kellyanne Conway carefully straddled the line by saying that  if  the allegations were true, Moore should resign. Trump, though, had something interesting to say about the subject of statutory rape three years ago. In a tweet, Trump called it  talent  to  date  a woman who s young enough to be his daughter.

" Watch: Joe Biden Just Wrecked Trump In Six Words And Its Hilarious","Former Vice President Joe Biden was asked on Monday by Matt Lauer on NBC s  Today  to name something specific that Donald Trump has been  doing well. Well, that seems like a trick question since Trump has passed no major legislation and reaches across the aisle only to take shots at Democrats in his Twitter timeline during his morning rage-tweets, so Biden struggled to find something, anything, that Trump has done well since taking office. I think there s a number of things he s doing well. But even the things he s doing well, it s how he does them,  Biden said. It s more the tone of this administration that bothers me,  he continued. With all due respect, you haven t come up with one thing you think he s doing well,  Lauer said. Well, I think he married very well,  Biden joked.Although, Biden didn t mention which of Trump s three marriages he s speaking of. Trump s first marriage to Ivana ended after he had an affair with Marla Maples. Trump went on to marry Maples, then they divorced. Trump is currently married to Melania. All three of Trump s wives are former models. Trump is a former reality show star. But, in all instances, he did marry up, since there is no  down  that Trump hasn t hit yet.After struggling to come up with something, Biden eventually praised Trump s choice of keeping military personnel stationed in the Middle East that was there at the end of the Obama administration.Watch:"What do you think Trump is doing well?""""I think he married very well.""Joe Biden answers questions on @TODAYshow https://t.co/F6EKxHe64M  NBC News (@NBCNews) November 13"," 2017In January"," Biden had some advice for Trump.

" All Of Roy Moores Former Colleagues Knew He Liked Dating Teenage Girls","In the late 1970 s, Alabama Senate Candidate Roy Moore (R- Of Course) would have been in his early 30 s. However, he liked little girls   literally. A bombshell report in the Washington Post alleges that Moore, who was 32 in 1979, approached Leigh Corfman in a courthouse. Corfman was 14 at the time. Moore picked the little girl up near her home, drove her to his home in the woods, and proceeded to molest her, according to the story. Now, this is the man who is running for the United States Senate. The thing is, though, Moore s political career should have been over and done with decades ago.You see, according to people who worked with Roy Moore at the time, it was, quote,  common knowledge  that he liked dating high schoolers. Moore s former colleague Theresa Jones, who was a Deputy District Attorney with Moore at the time, says of the situation: It was common knowledge that Roy dated high school girls, everyone we knew thought it was weird We wondered why someone his age would hang out at high school football games and the mall but you really wouldn t say anything to someone like that. Jones went on to urge others who know firsthand what Roy Moore is like to come forward:Original tweet by Teresa Jones: "I have no doubt these stories [about Roy Moore] have validity."" pic.twitter.com/oPWaeKrS8W  Alexander Marquardt (@MarquardtA) November 11"," 2017Well"," it s honestly not  dating  when it s a 30-something year old man and little girls.

" This Old Mike Pence Tweet Sure Is Uncomfortable Now That The G In MAGA Means Grope","GOP candidate Roy Moore is accused of sexually molesting a 14-year-old girl when he was 32-years-old and several of the state s officials have said they would still support him even if the allegations are true because it s better than voting for a Democrat. Some Republicans have called for Moore to step down  if  the accusations are true, even though they ve been backed up by 30 people and there are four accusers. Leigh Corfman, who voted for Donald Trump in 2016, said she was 14 years old when she met Moore, who later took her to his home. While there, she said Moore removed her shirt and pants, then he removed his clothes. Moore then allegedly touched her over her bra and underwear, and put her hand on his crotch.So Vice-President Mike Pence, a right-wing Christian, has stated that he found the allegations in the story  disturbing and believes, if true, this would disqualify anyone from serving in office.  Except that Pence s boss has been accused by numerous women of sexual misconduct and somehow, Trump supporters have always been cool with that.This unfortunate tweet sent out by Pence in late September is coming back at him fast AF.

" Miss Texas Gave A VERY Unexpected Answer When Asked About Trump, And Republicans Are Furious","Long before Cara Mund,  Miss North Dakota,  won the 2018 Miss America pageant, she faced a crowd of 50 other young women, all competing in various categories for the coveted crown. Two of those categories, to most of our readers, are patriarchal and silly: The evening wear and swimwear  competitions  pit all these beautiful young women against one another for assessment on their looks by a panel of judges.The other two categories, however, can be quite interesting, especially when something happens like what went down with Miss Texas in this year s competition.The talent portion of the show is, of course, just plain entertaining. Perhaps you ve seen the movie Miss Congeniality, starring Sandra Bullock, and if you have, you know what I m hoping to see in a talent show. The real thing is very little like that, however, and so is the interview portion of Miss America. Source: Meme Central, a folder on my computerTonight, Miss Texas was no Miss Rhode Island. There were two rounds of questions this time around, and when Margana Wood was called on for the second, more serious question, she got a doozy. Drawing a judge s name from a dish, she pulled Jess Cagle, the editor-in-chief of People Magazine. Cagle wasted zero time getting right to it: Last month, a demonstration of neo-Nazis, white supremacists, and the KKK in Charlottesville, Virginia turned violent and a counter-protester was killed. The president said there was shared blame with, quote,  very fine people on both sides.  Were there? Tell me yes or no, and explain. Well, then. That s a far cry from every participant simply answering  World Peace!  whenever their turn came around to say the one thing to the world they had in their heart. Ms. Wood was not, as they say, f*cking around. Barely containing her anger, Margana turned it up to 11: I think that the white supremacist issue, it was very obvious that it was a terrorist attack. And I think that president Donald Trump should have made a statement on it earlier, addressing the fact, and making sure all Americans feel safe in this country. That is the number one issue right now. Naturally, Republicans were butthurt.

" Someone Tried To Cash In On Antifa With These $375 Jackets And Twitter Had A Field Day","History has shown that one of the most cost-effective ways to project your dissatisfaction when attending a large organized protest is to go to an army surplus shop, buy a cheap M-65 field jacket for around $25 and some sharpies. Not only will the jacket keep you warm during the colder months, you can customize it to get the exact message you want across, all the while having that badass Robert De Niro in Taxi Driver vibe about you.The only problem with that approach is that customizing the jacket takes a combination of effort and creativity and not all of us have the time or the skills to pull it off   some of us are just too lazy. Fortunately for those who fit into either of those demographics, Barneys New York are now stocking the Alpha Industries  Anarchy  jacket for am extortionate outlay of $375. Sure, it may be kind of generic and not express exactly what is on your mind, but the general sentiment is there, I guess.So, what do you get for $375? As the Barneys website describes it, the  Alpha Industries  M-65 field jacket is constructed of olive cotton-blend canvas. This military-inspired piece is detailed with assorted handwritten graffiti, a checked pattern pocket, and anarchy symbols at the front and back. Alpha Industries were initially a contractor for the US Military and according to Angelyn Fernandez, their VP of Product, self-expression was the inspiration behind this piece. We have seen resistance to power and authority become a trend in our current pop culture and society, often expressed through fashion,  she said.  Since 1965 the M-65 field jackets have been a favored method to graphically express one s opinion. We developed the Barneys M-65 anarchy jacket to encompass the artistic and graphic expressions of individuality. There were just two major flaws in Ms. Fernadez s plan, the first being that the statements on the jacket can t really be deemed an  expression of individuality  if they are mass produced and sold for an enormous profit. The second is that the key demographic for whom she was aiming generally tend to shun capitalism. Those exact people, however, have embraced social media and many took to Twitter to show their lack of appreciation for the piece, many to hilarious effect.*swipes platinum Amex card *"Welcome to the resistance""  panamaorange (@panamaorange) November 3"," 2017FIGHT THE POWER!

" Hypocrite Ivanka Trump HUMILIATED For Calling For End To Sexual Harassment While Predator Dad Is In Japan With Her","This did NOT go well.In a nearly empty room of people on Friday at the World Assembly for Women in Japan, Ivanka Trump had the gall to talk about sexual harassment despite the fact that her own daddy has been accused of rape and sexual harassment by over a dozen women, not to mention the fact that he has openly treated women like shit over the years. All too often, our workplace culture fails to treat women with appropriate respect,  Trump said.  This takes all forms, including harassment, which can never be tolerated.

" Racists Heads Will Explode When They Find Out White-On-White Crime Is Higher","Despite what many racists say and regardless of the hand-picked statistics of the federal government in an effort to demonize black people, the rate of white-on-white crime in the United States is far higher than that of African-Americans victimizing white citizens.In a report published last Thursday by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) on  Race and Hispanic Origin of Victims and Offenders 2012-2015,  some staggering figures emerged. Research conducted over a four year period during which  U.S. residents experienced 5.8 million violent victimizations each year  found that the rate of white-on-white violent crime (12.0 per 1,000) was almost four times higher than black-on-white violent crime (3.1 per 1,000).However, even when the facts are blatantly obvious and staring them right in the face, there is no swaying some Republicans who still subscribe to the idea that African-Americans are still the largest threat to themselves and others.

" Melania Trump Hit With SERIOUS Side-Eye After Telling Black Kids To Respect Each Other","If you haven t noticed, no one associated with the Trump administration (including The Donald s mail-order bride) has any respect for people who aren t white fake Christians.Naturally, people thought it was a bit odd when Melania Trump announced she would be visiting schools to tell kids to be nicer to each other   you know, since her husband spends the majority of his time treating black people, Latino(s)s, and pretty much everyone conservatives hate en masse, like trash.Donald Trump accuses African-Americans of racism three times more than he does whites and pushes dangerous lies originating with Nazi groups about black crime rates.During her visit to Orchard Lake Middle School  in the suburbs of Detroit, Melania told kids to  make sure everyone feels included    a strange statement considering her husband s attempts to ban Muslims from entering the country, his attacks on African-Americans, and his decision to build a wall to keep Mexicans (whom he calls  rapists  and  drug dealers ) from coming into the United States.

" Soldiers Widow Finally Speaks: It Made Me Cry Even More  Trump Calls Her A Liar IMMEDIATELY","Monday morning, things got much worse for Donald Trump and his version of what happened during the phone call he made to Myeshia Johnson, the pregnant widow of Sgt. La David Johnson, who was killed in the Nigerian ambush orchestrated by ISIS.Appearing on ABC s Good Morning America, the grieving widow confirmed the account of the Florida Representative, Frederica Wilson, who was accompanying her on her way to meet her husband s remains when Trump s call came in. Not only did she repeat exactly what Wilson had recalled, but she said it made her  very upset and hurt,  and made her cry  even worse  on what must have been the worst day of her young life.She said that she has  nothing to say  to President Trump.Johnson was sucked into a bitter, public dispute over the call when Wilson recounted what Trump had said as she listened on speakerphone. The timeline of events just spirals from there, with Trump, his spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and his Chief of Staff retired 4-Star General John F. Kelly all taking swipes at Representative Wilson in lieu of overtly calling Myeshia Johnson herself a liar.All of that changed Monday morning.After Mrs. Johnson s appearance on GMA, Trump went back to Twitter one more time.

" NRA Releases Fascist Ad Calling All Trump Critics Saboteurs Whose Future Is Failure (VIDEO)","The First Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees that we have the right to speak our minds about the government and anyone and anything else we damn well please. However, since Donald Trump was inaugurated, that right has been under attack. Trump is a thin-skinned, narcissistic bully who cannot take criticism, and his allies are now doing all they can to discredit anyone who dares to say a word against Trump. Of course, at the top of that list is the National Rifle Association (NRA), the terrorist organization that thinks that all these mass shootings and gun-related deaths are just the price of freedom.Therefore, it comes as no surprise that Dana Loesch, a spokeswoman for the organization, has just released a new advertisement video that can only be described as purely fascist. She attacks anyone and everyone who dares to criticize Trump as saboteurs who wish to take the victory of Trump and his base away. You see, to these people, those who do not support Trump are the REAL threat to the republic, not Trump s fascist, authoritarian regime. Loesch s statement culminates in the following chilling statement: From the highest levels of government, to their media, universities and billionaires, their hateful defiance of his legitimacy is an insult to each of us. So, educational institutions, the free press, anyone and everyone who sees the dangers of Trumpism   we must be dealt with. It comes complete with violent imagery and creepy music to boot.

" Richard Spencers Fascist Goon Squad Couldnt Keep Florida From Laughing His Nazi Ass Off The Stage","Oooh, big scary Richard Spencer! The milky-white wannabe hipster douchebag must have had a giant erection since Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency on Tuesday in advance of his appearance at the University of Florida in Gainesville.As everyone knows, the primary aim of the  alt-right    the modern-day Nazis responsible for the murder of Heather Heyer in Virginia in August   is to eliminate people of color in America, and then prove they don t actually have the tiny dicks they re surely packing. So every time someone seems scared of them, it s another boost to their ego.Fortunately, most people are in on the joke at this point, and state and local leaders have become more accustomed to the violence that neo-Nazi rallies bring with them. Even businesses have gotten in on trolling Richard Spencer and his pathetic band of white supremacist losers.Case in point: Alligator Brewing, a craft beer maker located in Tall Paul s Brewhouse in Gainesville had an amazing idea the other day   to allow anyone holding two tickets to Spencer s event at UF to come trade them in for a free beer: Ticket become available this Saturday, October 14th and each person can get two with a valid ID. This is our town. This is our home. Let s do this Gainesville.A post shared by Alligator Brewing (@alligatorbrewing) on Oct 12, 2017 at 3:56pm PDTThat didn t take long to go viral, of course, and Spencer s lackeys soon heard about it. They changed the ticketing process so that people couldn t get them in advance. They became available only in person at the event, according to the Miami Herald. A white supremacist sycophant of Spencer s, Cameron Padgett, told the paper that it was in an effort to  avoid the sabotage that was planned by people. Padgett himself then suddenly appeared at Tall Paul s, pretending to try and trade some tickets for beer. After he was told by Alligator Brewing that they couldn t verify the authenticity of his tickets (since the fascists changed their ticketing scheme), he became very belligerent and began filming from inside the bar: Please stay safe #lesshatemorebeerA post shared by Alligator Brewing (@alligatorbrewing) on Oct 18, 2017 at 3:34pm PDTNone of it was enough to keep the actual event from being a hilarious shitshow for Richard Spencer and his cast of racist clowns.It cost Spencer $10k to rent this hall.The tickets were free.At least 90% of the seats were empty or filled w/protestors.#SpencerAtUF https://t.co/uXc1gIcyul  Holly O'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) October 19, 2017These Pepe-loving asshats were literally laughed out of the room as protester after protester shut down their racist rhetoric.

" Satanists Brilliantly Troll Anti-Gay Baker By Requesting A Birthday Cake For Lucifer (VIDEO)","Christian cake baker Jack Phillips gained national infamy when he violated Colorado s non-discrimination law by refusing to bake a cake for a gay couple s wedding. He was subsequently sued, and now his case is headed to the Supreme Court. Unfortunately, with the current makeup of the court and Donald Trump s administration in place, it is quite likely that discrimination will be codified into law. Nonetheless, The Satanic Temple has come up with a brilliant way to point out that religious freedom cuts both ways: By having these bigoted bakers make cakes for Satan.Jack Phillips has already had his first request via email from a Satanist seeking to celebrate Satan. It reads:Dear Mr PhillipsI would like to get a quote on a birthday cake, for a special event. It is a cake that is religious in theme, and since religion is a protected class, I am hoping that you will gladly bake this cake. As you see the birthday cake in question is to celebrate the birthday of Lucifer, or as they are also known Satan who was born as Satan when he was cast from heaven by God. The cake only needs to be a simple 9 13 single layer cake, with red and black icing. As well as to contain an upside down cross, under the head of Lucifer. And I thought I would seek you out, to bake this cake since you appear to be a very moral person since you refused to bake a cake for same sex couples. And since religion is a protected class, I hope you will be willing to bake this cake, so my small group of religious friends can celebrate the birthday of Lucifer this coming November, just a few days after Halloween.Sincerely,(Name redacted)Here is a sample cake posted to Twitter by The Satanic Temple s co-founder, Lucien Greaves:Did you know: bakers can't refuse service to The Satanic Temple because religion is a "protected class""? #SatanCakes pic.twitter.com/9VrVndkbSi  Lucien Greaves (@LucienGreaves) September 26"," 2017The whole point here is not to torment bakers or anyone else.

Todd Womack, Corker s chief of staff, refuted the claim later in the day, saying in a statement that the President called Senator Corker on Monday afternoon and asked him to reconsider his decision not to seek reelection and reaffirmed that he would have endorsed him, as he has said many times. Trump s Corker-directed fit of tweet-rage came just days after the Senator publicly criticized the President, a move that never sits well with Trump, leading him to try and seek revenge:Senator Bob Corker "begged"" me to endorse him for re-election in Tennessee.

Further, it is worth noting that the Colts were playing the San Francisco 49ers, which is the former team of Colin Kaepernick, the man who started this protest before being blacklisted from the NFL for taking a stand against police brutality against people of color. Further, Pence and Trump admitted that they used the situation to divide the country and make some kind of point on the taxpayers  dime   because of course we paid for Pence to travel to that football game.

Many people thought it was a perfect representation of standing up to the male-dominated culture of the financial industry, while others felt like it was just another commercial effort to cash in on the popularity of public companies suddenly growing a conscience and adopting policies that appease  social justice warriors  (also known as decent human beings).Unfortunately, one of those arguments has been proven right.According to the New York Post, the firm behind the statue that went up ostensibly to  promote gender equality,  State Street Corp, was caught underpaying 300 female employees, along with 15 more who were black.After the company was audited by the Department of Labor s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, they promised they would come up with the money, but in the meantime, it just looks bad. The company settled for $5 million, an astounding amount, considering the relatively small number of affected employees.How far will this faux-minism set women back? None. Real feminists don t require icons or court confirmation of oppression.Twitter was similarly unimpressed:Modern feminism sometimes suffers from a lack of explicit examples of sexism.

Juggalos, or fans of the band Insane Clown Posse, are in D.C. to protest what they call an unfair label from the FBI and Department of Justice classifying them as a  loosely organized hybrid gang. It s clear which group has the more ardent supporters, and it isn t the one I m calling (for the purposes of this piece)  the Trumpettes.

Like, for example, when he tweeted his denouncement of the Nazis who marched in Trump s name in Charlottesville, Virginia, with one of them murdering Heather Heyer, 32, and injuring 19 others, he failed to tag @RealDonaldTrump.But anyway, Ryan said during a press conference in Hillsboro, Oregon,  I don t think a government shutdown is necessary, and I don t think most people want to see a government shutdown, ourselves included. Ryan continued to say that  Congress in the House has already done its work on this issue  and left it up to the Senate. Given the time of year it is, and the rest of the appropriations we have to do, we re going to need more time to complete our appropriations process, particularly in the Senate,  he said.Talking Points Memo reports:Trump on Tuesday night suggested he would push to tie funding for his proposed border wall to a government spending bill Congress must pass in the fall to avert a shutdown.

" Republicans Are Lashing Out At Trump Over His Disgusting Press Conference: Apologize","Donald Trump held a bizarre press conference Tuesday in which he defended the Alt-Right Nazis who stormed the streets of Charlottesville, Virginia while giving Nazi salutes. The hate-rally resulted in one of Trump s deplorables losing his sh*t when he decided to use his car as a weapon to mow down peaceful anti-racist protesters, resulting in the murder of Heather Hyer, 32, and injuring 19 others. The presser went so off the rails that David Duke took to Twitter to thank Trump for sticking up for white supremacists.Even Republicans are not giving Trump a pass after he blamed  both sides  for the appalling violence.

" He Finally Came Out And Said It: Trump Calls Protesters As Bad As Nazis","Speaking at Trump Tower on Tuesday, Donald Trump finally confirmed in his own words that he believes protesters are as much to blame for the violence in Charlottesville last weekend. Asked by a reporter why he didn t name the Alt-Right in his condemnation of the murder of Heather Heyer at the hands of an Alt-Right activist, he defied the reporter to  define the alt-right for me,  repeating himself like the bully he is. As the reporter, who is not visible in this clip, tried to answer, Trump began to speak over her:Okay, what about the alt-left? Excuse me, what about the alt-left that came charging at the   as you say   the alt-right? Do they have any semblance of guilt? Let me ask you this. What about the fact they came charging, they came charging with clubs in their hands, swinging clubs? Do they have any problem? I think they do. As far as I m concerned, that was a horrible, horrible day. Wait a minute, I m not finished. I m not finished, Fake News.As reporters tried to get a word in edgewise, Trump clearly had to compose himself for the camera, obviously flustered. Then he told reporters in attendance that he had watched it  much more closely than you people watched it,  and:You had a group on one side that was bad, and you had a group on the other side that was also very violent. And nobody wants to say that, but I ll say it right now. You had a group on the other side that came charging in without a permit and they were very, very violent.After barely recovering from his disastrous  many sides  statement on Saturday, Trump just proved the disgusting, hateful Alt-Right correct again.

Seemingly not understanding that the 535 people in the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate are a co-equal branch of government and can totally kneecap him and even remove him from office if they so choose, Trump has been steadily attacking a GOP stalwart: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.First, Trump decided that McConnell needed to  get back to work  on his failed healthcare legislation. Then, he suggested that McConnell should resign if he cannot get Trump s legislative agenda through the Senate. Well, it seems that other GOP Senators are sick and tired of Trump s bullying of their Senate leader, and are coming after him.First, Orrin Hatch, who is easily the oldest member of the Senate at age 83, had his office release the following cryptic message regarding Trump s attacks on McConnell:"@SenateMajLdr has been the best leader we ve had in my time in the Senate"," through very tough challenges.

As someone said in the meeting, if the roles were reversed, it would be called a terrorist attack. And that s what it is, an act of terrorism. Authorities in Bloomington said that no one was injured in the blast at the city s Dar Al-Farooq Islamic Center.If the attack had happened in a white evangelical church during morning prayers by a Muslim, Donald Trump would have used the incident to promote his agenda to ban anyone from that religion from entering the U.S.After lashing out at the media and a Democratic Senator over his military record, Trump has still not addressed the mosque attack which has unnerved the Muslim community.Residents of the state are still waiting for Trump to condemn the attack, but instead, the amateur president is busy rage-tweeting about his critics. Silence on the part of public officials at the national level only serves to empower Islamophobes,  Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said in a statement calling for Trump to condemn the attack, according to the Los Angeles Times.

" Senator Who Has Accomplished Nothing Is Very Upset People Think Hes Accomplished Nothing","Mitch McConnell is not a happy man. That s probably true in general, especially considering he wakes up every morning only to find a bespectacled testudine in the mirror when he goes to brush his beak teeth. But speaking to a Rotary Club in his home state of Kentucky on Monday, poor Mitch seemed even more glum than usual. If you can imagine, his mood was darker than the night John McCain cut McConnell s healthcare bill down the belly with a Caesarean thumbs-down on the Senate floor.Why was he so upset? The Senate Majority Leader is mad because people just don t understand how government works. Specifically, they don t get the fact that legislation is apparently glacial in progress when he s involved. ABC News caught a little of McConnell s speech to the rotarians: I m not gonna ask for a show of hands, but I know everybody s saying we ve been there, haven t done anything. Which, uh, I find  Extremely irritating. Do go on, Mitch. And I m gonna tell you why. Now Congress goes on for two years. And part of the reason, I think, that the storyline is that we haven t done much is because, in part, because the president and others have set these early timelines about   things need to be done by a certain point. I bet this is the part where Mitch says Donald Trump is new to this job! Let me get some popcorn, because this is about to ge  ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ Now our new president has of course not been in this line of work before, and I think had excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process. And so part of the reason I think people feel like we re under-performing is because too many kind of artificial deadlines unrelated to the reality and the complexity of legislating may not have been fully understood. What?!? Nothing about Democrats screwing everything up? And of course our political adversaries love to say that any time. That s better.

Among other things, Trump said,  I don t watch CNN  but that s just not true. In mid-July, Trump said,  I have very little time for watching TV  and that, too, is not true. In April, Trump told the Associated Press,  The one thing I ve learned to do that I never thought I had the ability to do. I don t watch CNN anymore.

The first was to Mexican president Enrique Pe a Nieto, and Trump placed a call to Australian PM Malcolm Turnbull the very next day. But it was the latter call that sparked a trending topic on Twitter, following the discovery of a bizarre turn of phrase by the American president.

" Trump Humiliated By Being Forced To Sign Russia Sanctions Bill Which Limits His Power","Amateur president Donald Trump  signed was forced to sign a bill today to punish Russia for its interference in the 2016 election despite his reservations to tighten sanctions against Moscow. The 71-year-old Twitter-addict did not hold a signing ceremony. In late July, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a bill giving Congress the power to block any effort by the White House to weaken sanctions on Russia. That move was a direct challenge to Donald Trump s authority. So, Trump really had no choice here especially since his campaign is the focus of the probe into Russia s meddling in the presidential election last year.  The legislation was passed with overwhelming bipartisan support in Congress.The bill limits Trump s ability to lift or waive sanctions against Russia.

" Bush Ethics Lawyer Slams Trump: He Cant Go One Week Without Obstructing Justice [VIDEO]","Richard Painter, former ethics lawyer to President George W. Bush, claims that President Donald Trump  weighing in  on his son, Donald Trump Jr. s, statement on meeting with a Russian lawyer is yet another possible example of obstruction of justice by the U.S. Commander in Chief. Painter even went as far as to say that obstruction of justice is a weekly occurrence for the Trump administration. I would like to have one week from this White House where they don t engage in a new act of obstruction of justice,  Painter said during an interview on MSNBC s All In With Chris Hayes on Tuesday evening.Painter also added that if Trump Jr. has no problem using a false statement drafted by his father when dealing with the public, then he would probably have the same disregard for the truth while taking the stand to testify on the situation during a criminal investigation. Once the son says something in a public statement he d be very likely to say something to the special prosecutor, and lying to the special prosecutor is a crime. If he lies under oath it becomes perjury,  Painter said.  This is a common strategy for obstructing justice. But that wasn t the first time Richard Painter made his opinions about the President s method of dealing with the Russia accusations known.

" Insane Racist Fired For Death Threats Against Muslims Parked Too Close At Walmart","You thought the people passing through Fargo, North Dakota were crazy. Now we have to worry about wood chippers in the Wal-Mart parking lot.On Tuesday, genuinely terrifying racist Amber E. Hensley confronted some Muslim women who she felt had  parked too close  for her to get in her car, although vehicle proximity may not have been the only factor, it appears. In mere moments, the disagreement turned into death threats against sisters Sarah and Laleyla Hassan and another passenger in their car, Rowda Soyan. All are Somali-American Muslims.The trio was on their way to see a movie, Raw Story reports, when they were approached by Hensley, who shouted at them through the window of their car. After exchanging taunts about who was or was not an American, the sister with the camera, Sarah, asked the woman  what are you gonna do?  Hensley leaned in and told the young women just what her intentions were: We re gonna kill all of ya. We re gonna kill every one of you fuckin  Muslims.Later, she asked the would-be moviegoers  why are you in our country, anyway? Hensley was fired nearly as soon as the video went public. From a statement issued by Horab & Wentz, the accounting firm where she previously worked:The women, of course, disagreed about what happened when the camera wasn t rolling. After her firing, Amber Hensley posted an  apology  on her now-deleted Facebook page:In an interview with the Twin Cities Pioneer Press, Sarah Hassan denied ever having insulted Jesus.We Muslims, we believe in Jesus, too. If I abuse Jesus it s like I m abusing my own god and I not going to be considered a Muslim.This is a common mistake among Christians who don t know anything about Islam. There are a great many parallels between the two Abrahamic religions, although names differ between them. In addition to lying about what Sarah said, Sarah claims that Hensley also mocked her sister Lalelya s crossed eyes and said it was the reason the women were parked so poorly.Amber Hensley was, of course, a big fan of Donald Trump:Trump may have said some things years ago  But Hilary has BLOOD on her hands!

" Democratic Twitter Hero Ted Lieu Taunts Trump Over Just-Passed Russia Sanctions","Thursday afternoon, the US Senate passed new sanctions against Russia with a vote of 97-2. Just two Republicans   Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah   voted against the bill, which passed the House on Tuesday with a similar percentage of Yea votes. Both chambers served up a veto-proof majority in a show of bipartisan action rarely seen outside honorary legislation.The bill provides new sanctions for Russia, Iran, and North Korea, and includes a stunning rebuke to the president, whose power is stymied by the language of the legislation. Congressional approval would be required for the president to subsequently lift or even ease any sanctions. The measure came in response to Russian interference in the 2016 election, solidifying the consensus among literally everyone except Donald Trump, who still occasionally denies interference altogether, when he s not blaming Barack Obama for not doing anything about it.Democratic Representative Ted Lieu, who has been a frequent foil for Trump on his favorite social media platform, was on Twitter in a heartbeat after passage of the bill:As a Member of the House Foreign Affairs Cmte, I know this sanctions bill is a great deal for America.

Ms. Abe did not speak to Trump for two hours, according to the alleged president who gave an interview with the New York Times, a paper which he has repeatedly said was  failing. So, I was seated next to the wife of Prime Minister Abe [Shinzo Abe of Japan], who I think is a terrific guy, and she s a terrific woman, but doesn t speak English,  Trump told Maggie Haberman of the Times in the exclusive interview. Like, nothing, right?  Haberman asked.  Like zero? Trump explained that Japan s First Lady didn t even say hello to him. Like, not  hello,  Trump told the reporter. That must make for an awkward seating,  Haberman said.Trump said,  Well, it s hard, because you know, you re sitting there for Hours,  the reporter said. So the dinner was probably an hour and 45 minutes,  Trump added. I was sitting next to the president of Argentina   his wife   [Mauricio] Macri   nice woman, who speaks English. And the prime minister of Japan s wife, Prime Minister Abe. Great relationships,  Trump continued.  So I m sitting there.

He also said that the Trump Jr. emails take on a new legal meaning   and that it means people need to stop talking to the press and start talking under oath. Of course, for pathological liars, this is a huge deal, because lying under oath is a crime.Senator Whitehouse said to host Chris Hayes: If there s been a legal violation here   and this very strong indications that there has   then you re dealing with things like indictments, and the House potentially beginning impeachment proceedings, and people having to start talking under oath, instead of you know, talking out on the airwaves, where they lie as easily as they breathe.

The same day, Republicans announced they would be putting a stunningly cruel addition into the legislation   a rule that a person who misses one or two months of coverage the year before would be forced to lose their health insurance for 6 months as punishment before being allowed to sign up again.With the stakes that high, protesters   many of whom are disabled and depend on the life-saving benefits of Medicaid   descended on Republican offices across the country to voice their outrage. Instead of sympathy, they ve been ignored, kicked out, and in this case, assaulted. The Republican Party seems unwilling to look its victims in the eyes while they seek to destroy their lives, a lack of courage stunning even for them.As of this writing, at least one of the activists injured in the attack is still recuperating at the hospital.Spox: Activist still @ hospital.

I recognize that repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act has become a core tenet of the Republican Party,  Obama said.  Still, I hope that our Senators, many of whom I know well, step back and measure what s really at stake, and consider that the rationale for action, on health care or any other issue, must be something more than simply undoing something that Democrats did. The Senate bill, unveiled today, is not a health care bill. It s a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America,  he continued.  It hands enormous tax cuts to the rich and to the drug and insurance industries, paid for by cutting health care for everybody else. Simply put, if there s a chance you might get sick, get old, or start a family   this bill will do you harm. And small tweaks over the course of the next couple weeks, under the guise of making these bills easier to stomach, cannot change the fundamental meanness at the core of this legislation. That s the key word    meanness.  Trumpcare is designed not to help Americans, but to provide massive tax cuts for the richest Americans while leaving the rest of us to suffer. This debate has always been about something bigger than politics,  Obama added.  It s about the character of our country   who we are, and who we aspire to be. And that s always worth fighting for.

" Reporters Covering Inauguration Day Anti-Trump Protest Face 70 Years In Prison (VIDEO)","On January 20 this year, more than 230 people were arrested without warning in relation to the anti-Trump protests that took place in Washington DC. Now some of those involved face up to 70 years behind bars, including the reporters and photographers who were just trying to bring us the news.Heavily-armed riot police closed off an entire city block in Washington on the day of Donald Trump s inauguration, encircling the bulk of the protestors, however, the order to disperse never came, police just started arresting protestors. It didn t even cross my mind that was what was happening,  said independent photographer and videographer Alexei Wood.  I was waiting for an order of dispersal and the mass of people showed no sign of resistance when the police completely surrounded them. Almost all of the protests that took place that day went by without violence or arrests on a mass scale, with the exception of Black Bloc anarchists and anti-fascists clashing with police. Wood was unfortunate enough to be scooped up when police retaliated by firing rubber bullets and tear gas at the protestors, as well as launching concussion grenades into the crowd.When the smoke had cleared, more than $100,000 worth of damage had been inflicted on property, cars, and buildings, according to the U.S. Attorney s Office for the District of Columbia. The following day, more than 230 people, including Wood and several other journalists, were arrested for felony rioting, a charge that carries a statutory maximum sentence of 10 years in prison and a fine of $25,000, however, some were lucky enough to have the charges dropped.Things went from bad to worse for Wood and company when, on April 27, the Superior Court of the District of Columbia returned a superseding indictment giving additional charges to 212 defendants, three of whom hadn t even been previously charged. These new charges include urging to riot, conspiracy to riot and destruction of property and could see the defendants spending between 70 and 80 years in prison. Wood alone faces five felony property destruction charges and three felony rioting charges.Alexei Wood, based in San Antonio, Texas, focuses on social justice struggles and resistance movements in his work, but now he finds himself in the exact same position as those for whom he tries to do justice, stating that the implications of the defendants  cases  are humungous for striking fear into protesters. The state is not just going after window-breakers, which in itself may not be justified. Instead, the state seeks to criminalize dissent by indiscriminately arresting more than 200 people and imposing a slew of felony charges that carry the potential of decades in prison,  Wood continued.  But it also means if we re [journalists] too close to a newsworthy story, we could be facing more than 70 years. Wood posted live footage of the anti-fascist march on his Facebook page, the 42-minute video showing him complying with police orders, while at no stage suggesting that he took place in any violent acts. The livestream speaks for itself. It s right there for everybody to see. I love that it s there for everybody to see because I want individual people to see my work and make their own decision,  he said.  I think it s a very clear case.

I would be glad to tell him exactly what I told you,  the president said during a press conference in the White House Rose Garden. Yesterday showed no collusion, no obstruction,  Trump said, ignoring that Comey said nothing to dispute collusion or obstruction. He refused to comment in an open setting.  But we were very, very happy and, frankly, James Comey confirmed a lot of what I said. And some of the things that he said just weren t true. Yes, according to The Donald, Comey   a liar    confirmed  many of the things he has said, even though he s a lying liar whose pants are on fire.Though he originally threatened to release tapes of his conversations with Comey, The Donald now says they may not exist, telling reporters that you will be very disappointed when you hear the answer.

Richard Burr, on Wednesday. Key moments Comey will bring up include the time that Trump asked him to pledge his loyalty and to drop the investigation into National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. The President said,  I need loyalty, I expect loyalty,'  Comey has written in his prepared testimony.  I didn t move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. Comey had nine one-to-one conversations with Trump, three personal and six by phone, within a span of four months and he kept detailed notes on each of them, a practice he never felt necessary while working under Barack Obama. All of the personal interactions and two of the phone conversations are included in the prepared testimony. Obviously, Republicans are going into panic mode due to some of the explosive claims in the document, with Senator John Cornyn, a Republican from Texas, telling a reporter from the One America News Network he wants to see the memos that Comey kept.Senator Cornyn tells me re: Comey, "If he wrote memos I think we are entitled to see those memos.""

" Trump Denies Leaking Israeli Source, Confirming Source Is Israeli On International Television (VIDEO)","Trump s third day across seas may end up being his most devastating. Sitting down with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Trump opened his mouth and immediately started blundering his way into an international incident.As the pair of world leaders sat down, Trump seemed to want to get something off his chest that had been bothering him. Last week, it was reported that Trump had leaked classified intelligence about ISIS to the Russians during their closed-door meeting in the Oval Office. Trump s White House frantically denied it before eventually conceding it had happened, but claimed it wasn t that big of a deal. Then news came that it was an Israeli spy that Trump had just exposed by his careless leak.And now Trump, sitting in Israel, wanted to make one thing clear: He never shared the part about the source being Israeli. He said this on international television.Trump just said he never mentioned Israel in his meeting w/ Russians.(That was not the issue Story never alleged Trump divulged source.) pic.twitter.com/oSi8rQmQe0  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) May 22, 2017That s, uh, a pretty stunning admission. The implications were immediately clear to everyone but Trump. Trump may as well have just confirmed that it was an Israeli informant. The spy is likely to face death if caught by ISIS, who now, thanks to Trump s internationally broadcast statement, know to look for one.Unreal. Trump seems to have just accidentally confirmed Israel was the source of the intel with this admission. https://t.co/yPcQPADYte  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) May 22, 2017Trump just used his photo op with Netanyahu to defend sharing sensitive intel with the Russians in the Oval, saying he never said "Israel.""

According to a plaque   yes, a plaque   Trump proudly displays at the  Trump National Golf Club in Virginia, the length of the Potomac River that borders his course is called the River of Blood because both Union and Southern soldiers died en masse between the 14th and 15th holes. The  FAILING  New York Times reported in 2015:Between the 14th hole and the 15th tee of one of the club s two courses, Mr. Trump installed a flagpole on a stone pedestal overlooking the Potomac, to which he affixed a plaque purportedly designating  The River of Blood. Many great American soldiers, both of the North and South, died at this spot,  the inscription reads.  The casualties were so great that the water would turn red and thus became known as  The River of Blood. The inscription, beneath his family crest and above Mr. Trump s full name, concludes:  It is my great honor to have preserved this important section of the Potomac River! The site does have historical significance alongside the Bowling Green Massacre, in that its historical significance is completely made up. No. Uh-uh. No way. Nothing like that ever happened there,  said Richard Gillespie, executive director of the Mosby Heritage Area Association, said of Trump s claim. Gillespie added that the only thing  close to  that was the  Battle of Ball s Bluff in 1861 in which several hundred Union solders were killed. It happened 11 miles upriver, nowhere near the  River of Blood. Called on his lie, Trump attempted to salvage his story by explaining: That was a prime site for river crossings. So, if people are crossing the river, and you happen to be in a civil war, I would say that people were shot   a lot of them. Historians say that literally no one has ever died in that crossing, but Trump complains that someone might have died at some point. How would they know that?  Trump said angrily after learning that historians say his stupid plaque is FAKE NEWS.  Were they there?  Trump says  numerous historians  have confirmed the  River of Blood.

" Trump Just Got WRECKED By Chelsea Clinton Over His Dumbass Slavery Remarks (TWEETS/VIDEO)","Anyone who has been to grade school is fully aware that Andrew Jackson died before a certain bloody conflict in which southerners fought their countrymen (former countrymen if you consider the Confederacy to be legitimate like many Trump supporters do) over the right to own other human beings, but Donald Trump has his own  alternative facts  about  swashbuckler  Jackson.Trump says he learned during a recent visit to Tennessee that  they love Andrew Jackson  down there, questioning whether Jackson, who owned 150 men, women, and children when he died in 1845, could have stopped the Civil War, which began in 1861, if he had  been a little bit later. I mean had Andrew Jackson been a little bit later you wouldn t have had the Civil War. He was a very tough person, but he had a big heart,  Trump told the Washington Post s Salena Zito. He was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War, he said,  There s no reason for this.' Yes, according  to Trump, slave owner Andrew Jackson was angry about a war that began long after his death and totally would have acted against his own self-interest (slavery was the source of all of his money) to stop it if he hadn t been so dead. But he was mad. Then Trump wondered why the Civil War happened in the first place   a question appropriate coming from someone who thinks a hardcore slave owner would have stopped it: People don t ask that question, but why was there the Civil War? Why could that one not have been worked out? Fortunately,  Crooked Hillary s  daughter stepped up to provide him with the answer in a manner Trump may understand: under 140 characters:1 word answer: Slavery.

" Dem Lawmaker Out-Trolls Internet Troll By Calling His Grandmother (IMAGE)","The Internet can be a vicious place and an openly gay lawmaker has gotten used to being the recipient of homophobic slurs. On Wednesday morning, Pennsylvania House Rep. Brian Sims woke up to find a message on his Facebook page which read,  N**ger faggot.  There wasn t much information on the troll s Facebook page. What caught me about it was there wasn t a reference to something I said or something I d done or some policy,  Sims told the Huffington Post.  And when I looked at his page there was very little there   but he d posted a telephone number a number of times. At 6:15 a.m. Sims decided to call the number and the woman who answered the phone turned out to be the troll s grandmother. You ve all seen the  Brave keyboard warrior sitting in Mom s basement eating a hot pocket sandwich  type meme but this was real life. I explained to her exactly who I as and what he had done,  Sims said.  Like any grandma she was very embarrassed at having this kind of convo and very ashamed at the actions of her grandson. The conversation ended with me telling her that I wanted to hear from him. Sims did speak to the troll but he said that the conversation  didn t resolve anything. It is the ultimate calling card of a coward to   under the guise of night and behind a keyboard   use the kind of language that in person would cause most decent people to respond in anger and frustration,  Sims said.  The reason people do things like this is they don t have the courage, the education or gumption to do this kind of thing in person. At the top of Sims  Facebook page, it now reads:Dear Bigots, posting your grandmother s telephone number all over the same page you use to post slurs on other people s pages is not going to end well for you.

" Stephen Colbert SCORCHES Jeff Sessions Racism In One Brilliant Tweet","Late Show host Stephen Colbert is no fan of Donald Trump and his administration of bigots. Therefore, he was, of course, incensed at Attorney General Jeff Sessions  racist attack on a sitting federal judge regarding Trump s bigoted Muslim Ban.Judge Derrick Watson infamously blocked Trump s Muslim Ban 2.0, and in the decision he said the whole thing read like a   neon sign flashing  Muslim ban, Muslim ban. On Thursday, Sessions went full dog whistle when he criticized Judge Watson s decision, saying the following: We are confident that the president will prevail on appeal and particularly in the Supreme Court, if not the Ninth Circuit. So this is a huge matter. I really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the president of the United States from what appears to be clearly his statutory and Constitutional power. Of course, that brings back the fact that accusations of racism have dogged Sessions for decades, and rightly so. He is a throwback to a time we really should be trying to get away from, and here he is, the nation s top law enforcement officer. Shameful, but true. Therefore, Stephen Colbert s tweet on the matter is more than fitting:Sessions is "amazed"" an ""island in the Pacific"" judge can block the travel ban.

But really, we can t blame the former reality show star for wanting to forgo the tradition considering how horrifying Trump s nearly 100 days in office has been. As for his accomplishments, we re not seeing any.

" AG Sessions Directs Disgusting Insult At Hawaii After Hawaiian Judge Blocks Trumps Muslim Ban","Trump s Attorney General Jeff Sessions is as furious as Trump is over the blocking of an executive order that would have denied Muslims entry into the United States. Rather than reassess their own morality, the Islamophobic tag team has gone after the judges who have pointed out their plans are unconstitutional. For Trump, a former reality tv star and current 70-year-old Fox News viewer, the inability to understand the basics of America s justice system is pretty much a given, but his Attorney General seems just as clueless   and it s literally his job to understand the law.Highlighting his sheer incompetence to perform the job he was handpicked to do, Sessions (formerly an Alabama senator best known for being a racist) slammed the state of Hawaii and discounted its importance in the United States with a shocking rant during an interview with right-wing conspiracy theorist Mark Levin: We ve got cases moving in the very, very liberal Ninth Circuit, who, they ve been hostile to the order,  Sessions said.  We won a case in Virginia recently that was a nicely-written order that just demolished, I thought, all the arguments that some of the other people have been making. We are confident that the President will prevail on appeal and particularly in the Supreme Court, if not the Ninth Circuit. So this is a huge matter. I really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the President of the United States from what appears to be clearly his statutory and Constitutional power. That judge  sitting on an island in the Pacific  Sessions was so quick to dismiss? He s a federal judge working in a federal court in the U.S. state of Hawaii. Hardly a random nobody.As ever, the Trump administration s go-to defense of their badly botched policies is to attack the critics for not letting them do whatever they want. Trump s so-called  travel ban  would have overtly banned many Muslims from entering the United States based exclusively on their religion and ethnicity. The Constitution is pretty clear on that. The ruling was so straightforward that it was actually confirmed by several other federal judges before Trump announced that he was dropping his stab at it and starting over.And given Sessions  track record, it is a bit more odious that he would choose to go after the  island in the Pacific  populated by a diverse group of Americans. Racist dog whistles aren t supposed to be this loud.UPDATE: As reporters have pointed out, Sessions  smear on Judge Derrick Watson is even more obviously partisan because he actually voted for him.FYI Jeff Sessions voted to confirm Derrick Watson, the federal judge he's now attacking as "a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific"". pic.twitter.com/kfeL4ZoKrP  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) April 20"," 2017Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images"",News

" White Grievance Princess Tomi Lahren Whines About Getting Fired, And I Could Watch It All Day (VIDEO)","Recently Tomi Lahren   a woman who literally built a career on hate at Glenn Beck s TheBlaze tried to make herself seem less horrible than she actually is during an appearance on The View and said that her  limited government  stance included being pro-choice. Unfortunately for Lahren, while she could get away with making racist comment after racist comment, the one thing conservatives will not tolerate is a woman speaking out about having rights to anything   especially her body.Some are rushing to Lahren s defense after Glenn Beck fired her for expressing the one viewpoint she has (assuming it s legitimate) that isn t completely horrifying, and she is taking that encouragement and running with it. Recently, Lahren filed a lawsuit against Beck alleging wrongful termination   and she stopped by ABC News to whine about how unfair it is that she got fired from her position as an extreme-right propagandist because she said something that was contrary to conservatives  core  values  (that word is used as loosely as possible). My job is my life. This is my life. Without that, I feel lost,  Lahren told ABC News   Nightline  on Friday.  When your outlet is taken away from you and you don t understand why and you re so disappointed and you re so blindsided, it hurts. I was getting ready to go in and do my show and I got a phone call saying that show was not on,  have been suspended for a week, perhaps longer ,  Lahren whined.  I was flabbergasted. Lahren s lawsuit, like her persona, is as fake as any randomly-selected promise from the mouth of Donald Trump. She has not been fired and instead remains under contract. Most importantly, she is still getting paid. It is puzzling that an employee who remains under contract (and is still being paid) has sued us for being fired, especially when we continue to comply fully with the terms of our agreement with her,  TheBlaze told ABC in a statement. She will continue to be paid until her contract expires in September but feels that her  First Amendment rights  (the First Amendment only applies to government interference) were violated when Beck decided that he didn t want someone walking around talking like women are people.Nevertheless, Lahren complains that she had been  silenced  and  sidelined  just like all those minorities she hates. I don t sit down in my chair and deliver my  Final Thoughts,  I don t have a dressing room, so I m terminated, I m fired  the way I look at things, I m not doing what I was contracted to do, which was produce a television show, a political talk show,  Lahren sobbed. This is not about politics,  she says.  This is about someone who had an opposing viewpoint that has been silenced and sidelined and thrown away. But, of course, that s what you do with garbage   you throw it away (and, according to the lawsuit, stretch yellow  CAUTION  tape across the door of its dressing room). I m someone with a thick skin and I can stand up to about anybody,  the thin-skinned bully said.  But when somebody does that that s really hard for me to take in Loyalty is everything to me, and you can disagree with me, but to go out and try to humiliate me? Very, very disappointed. I m a human being at the end of the day and something has been stripped from me and that s my ability to work, that s my ability to have a voice,  Lahren told ABC without providing any of the much-needed evidence that she is, in reality, human.  That s been taken from me wrongfully. So I m upset by it, and I m hurt by it and I feel betrayed by it. Interestingly, her  pro-choice  comments don t exactly mix well with her numerous aspersions cast at women who correctly believe they have a right to make decisions regarding their own bodies.(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_GB/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js"," fjs);}(document"," 'script'"

" Weird: Republicans Were Against Obama Launching A Strike On Syria But Not Now (DETAILS)","A U.S. official said that the Russians were warned before the U.S. launched at least 59 tomahawk missiles aimed at Syria at Donald Trump s orders, but the alleged president did not seek Congressional approval. Trump was reportedly affected by the pictures of children who were harmed or killed after a deadly gas was unleashed on civilians, but oddly, the former reality show star was never disturbed by the pictures of Syrian refugees fleeing from terror at the hands of ISIS.Trump was not in The Situation Room when addressing the strikes.

It was a slow and brutal death for so many. Even beautiful babies were cruelly murdered in this very barbaric attack. No child of God should ever suffer such horror. However, Trump opposed President Barack Obama s attempt to strike when a sarin nerve gas attack left more than 1,400 dead outside of Damascus in 2013.Trump tweeted at the time,  What will we get for bombing Syria besides more debt and a possible long term conflict?

" This Amazingly Diverse Book About Santa Claus Will Make Right-Wing Heads Explode","We all remember the uproar over at Fox News a few years back when the idea of a black Santa Claus came up. In fact, Megyn Kelly was so upset that she had to insist live on the air to all the little children of the world that Santa Claus could only be white. Well, if they were upset by that, they are going to really blow their stacks over the version of Santa Claus being rolled out in a new children s book.Called Santa s Husband, the Harper s Design book portrays Santa as a black man who is also gay. His husband is a white man. The husband also doubles for Santa at malls worldwide, and the book chronicles their happy existence in the North Pole. Aside from the heaping helping of diversity, even better is the fact that the book s author is Daniel Kibblesmith, who writes for The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.Kibblesmith says of the concept, and how it all began as a joke with his partner: My fianc e [author Jennifer Wright] and I joked privately, and then on Twitter, that since every house has its own traditions and lore surrounding Christmas, we would tell our child that the black Santa Claus was the  real  Santa. If they saw a white Santa at the mall, we d explain that this was his husband. Kibblesmith also joked about it on Twitter:Me & @JenAshleyWright have decided our future child will only know about Black Santa. If they see a white one we'll say "That's his husband""  Daniel ""Kibblesmith"" (@kibblesmith) December 3"," 2016He then realized that it was something that people were actually interested in"," due to the wide interest it generated on Twitter and said he saw  there was genuine interest in this book becoming a reality.

Indeed Clinton was able to turn in a strong debate performance, but did she do so fairly? Multiple reports and leaked information from inside the Clinton camp claim that the Clinton campaign was given the entire set of debate questions an entire week before the actual debate.Earlier last week an NBC intern was seen hand delivering a package to Clinton s campaign headquarters, according to multiple sources. The package was not given to secretarial staff, as would normally happen, but the intern was instead ushered into the personal office of Clinton campaign manager Robert Mook. Members of the Clinton press corps from several media organizations were in attendance at the time, and a reporter from Fox News recognized the intern, but said he was initially confused because the NBC intern was dressed like a Fed Ex employee.Even though the story is a lie, right-wing websites, Russian trolls, and everyone who hates Hillary Clinton jumped on the opportunity to accuse the former Secretary of State of cheating.He then pushed his insane allegation that President Obama put a  tapp  on his  wires  at Trump Tower..@FoxNews from multiple sources: "There was electronic surveillance of Trump"," and people close to Trump.

" Republican Has Epiphany: Wracking My Brain To Think Of One [Positive] Thing Our Party Has Done","Just a few years after Republicans shut down the government. Then came so close to defaulting on America s debts that the nation s credit rating was reduced. Then nominated a reality television star and serial liar as president. Then elected said reality television star and serial liar to actually be president even after a tape was released where he bragged about sexual assault. Republican Representative Tom Rooney had an epiphany: Maybe  maybe the Republican Party is a joke?It may seem obvious to some, but even Republicans themselves are starting to question whether or not the GOP has a single good idea in years.Rooney s epiphany came after he watched how his party botched a healthcare reform bill that the GOP had spent seven years promising to pass. From start to finish, the effort was a spectacular failure. The bill itself was a rush job and so poorly constructed that an independent assessment of its effects found that it would result in 24 million fewer people having insurance while also not saving the country any money. The bill s popularity hovered around 17%. Then the right-wing section of the Republican Party actually revolted against the bill because it didn t kick more people off of insurance. Then Trump demanded the GOP prove its loyalty to him by passing the bill anyway   and nobody listened. The bill failed before it even got a vote, humiliating both Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan.Republicans, including Rooney, were shook. So much so that Rooney began saying the one thing you as a Republican are never supposed to say aloud.As the prospect of a loss became more real on Friday, the frustrations of GOP lawmakers loyal to the leadership began to boil over.  I ve been in this job eight years, and I m wracking my brain to think of one thing our party has done that s been something positive, that s been something other than stopping something else from happening,  Representative Tom Rooney of Florida said in an interview.

All of us, all of us   myself included   will need to time to reflect on how we got to this moment,  he added.How we got to this moment is that the Affordable Care Act is immensely popular. While it could use some improvements   like a move toward universal healthcare   the GOP s effort to  repeal and replace  is not as popular with voters as it may have seemed on the campaign trail.But they won t actually reflect on that, will blame Obama, and will present Americans with something equally horrible somewhere down the line.Ryan was forced to utter one of the most beautiful 22 words we have heard since Donald Trump was kinda-sorta elected by less than half of the population: ObamaCare will remain the law of the land until it s replaced. We re going to be living with ObamaCare for the foreseeable future. The president gave his all in this effort. He did everything he possibly could to help people see the opportunity we have with this bill. He really has been fantastic,  Ryan said. Still, we have to do better and we will. This battle is won. The Affordable Care Act is safe for now. But the war is far from over, and all of us must fight each day to oppose the GOP s hateful agenda.The only thing standing between them and the destruction of all we hold dear is us.Watch Ryan s shamed admission below:"Obamacare is the law of the land and it will remain the law of the land until it's replaced"," Speaker Ryan says: https://t.co/Okz2bwUl4f pic.twitter.com/9F3MnW7oMR  CBS News (@CBSNews) March 24"," 2017Featured image via screengrab""

" Photo Of GOP Meeting To Kill Maternity Care Goes Viral After People Notice Totally Offensive Detail","In a stunning example of just how out-of-touch and heartless the Republican Party is towards women s healthcare, Vice President Mike Pence convened a meeting to discuss the topic of stripping maternity care requirements from health insurance   and forgot to invite even a single woman.Needless to say, an image of the meeting is now blowing up on social media as Americans sit in stunned amazement that this is how Congress and the White House think of the women who make up half the country.Democratic politicians were equally outraged. Massachusetts Representative Jim McGovern tweeted his anger over the sheer audacity of this meeting. The picture clearly struck a nerve because the tweet quickly racked up thousands of retweets.This is outrageous: Not a single woman in the room as @Mike_Pence and @HouseGOP propose removing maternity coverage in #Trumpcare. pic.twitter.com/wwY6WsN206  Jim McGovern (@RepMcGovern) March 23, 2017(Pictured above: Some dicks, a lot of assholes, but not a single uterus.)And the group was taking women s health so seriously that it appears one member actually fell asleep during the meeting:@RepMcGovern @DaithiFall @mike_pence @HouseGOP and one dude who s clearly dozed off pic.twitter.com/7RV9qj2whN  Kevin Byrne (@KevByrneBox) March 23, 2017Trump and Paul Ryan have been frantically offering  deals  to the fringe right-wing of the GOP in the hopes that they will agree to pass the Obamacare-replacement known as the  American Health Care Act.  The bill has been nothing short of a disaster for Republicans. For starters, it keeps many of the items that infuriate conservatives intact, while at the same time doing everything that Obamacare did, but less well. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that over 24 million people would likely lose their health insurance thanks to this bill. For many people, it would also cause their premiums to skyrocket.Rather than fix the bill   or better yet, keep the ACA   Trump and Ryan are making huge concessions to the ultra-right. One such concession is to remove the  health care  part of the health care bill. Republicans are considering dropping the so-called  essential health benefits  of the ACA, allowing insurers to pick and chose what they want to cover. Naturally, things like maternity care and emergency services would be the first to go. Which brings us back to the  House Freedom Caucus  and its all-male members.In a dimly lit room, the group of conservative white men sat around a table and weighed the relative merits of providing maternity care to women. To give one an idea of how dismissive these elderly GOPers were towards giving health care to women, here s how Trump s Press Secretary Sean Spicer framed it:Sean Spicer on healthcare: "I think if you're an older man you can generally say that you're not going to need maternity care.""

" Donald Trump Jr Posts Disgusting Lie About Londons Muslim Mayor Minutes After London Terror Attack","This morning, a man drove his car into a crowd near the UK s parliament building and began attacking bystanders with a knife. Across the ocean, America s conservative handled the scary situation with characteristic boorishness. At the forefront of this despicable behavior was President Trump s own son. British police hadn t even confirmed the number of dead before Donald Trump Jr used the attack as a pretext to promote Islamophobia on Twitter.While emergencies workers worked on the injured and police began piecing together what happened, Don Jr. decided his contribution would be to spread a vicious and pathetic lie about London s mayor.

Well, now, King himself has given us the answer as to why the condemnation didn t come from elected GOP officials as it should: Because, privately, they agree with him. King said: My colleagues have generally been coming by and patting me on the back. And a surprising number have said that they pray for me. And, meaning they support me and they agree with me, a surprising number. I don t often have members come up and say at the end of the day,  I prayed for you this morning.  So they must think I ve got a lot of arrows in my back. The only Republicans who condemned King s offensive remarks were those who are the children of immigrants themselves. Rep.

That was not during us,  Trump recently told Fox News propagandist Tucker Carlson during an interview.  That was during the Obama situation. Mike Pompeo is there now doing a fantastic job. In saying those words, it appears that The Donald did something against which he has been railing ever since his administration began leaking more than two Russian prostitutes in a certain orange man s Moscow hotel room: he leaked classified information.Now as President, Donald Trump can declassify any information he wants, but Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California points out that Trump did not make a purposeful decision  to do that. He just talked. In his effort to once again blame Obama, the President appeared to have discussed something that, if true and accurate, would otherwise be considered classified information,  Schiff said in a press release. The president has the power to declassify whatever he wants, but this should be done as the product of thoughtful consideration and with intense input form any agency affected. For anyone else to do what the President may have done, would constitute what he deplores as  leaks,  Schiff says. He also took to Twitter to rail against Mr. Number 45 for applying a different set of rules to himself than others:.@POTUS appears to have discussed something that, if true & accurate, would be classified.

Well, of course I meant exactly what I said,  King told CNN s  New Day  as he blamed  the Left  for wanting to destroy  Western civilization : This is an effort on the left, I think, to break down the American civilization, the American culture, and turn it into something entirely different. I m a champion for western civilization and yes our English language is a big part of it. It s a carrier of freedom. Embarrassingly, King refused to say that Muslim-Americans, Christian-Americans, and other Americans of different background are equal, instead saying that they contribute differently to our culture and our civilization. I d say they re all created in the image of God, and they re equal in his eyes. And if they re citizens of the United States, they re equal in the eyes of the law,  King said.  Individuals will contribute differently not equally to this civilization and certain groups of people will contribute more to this society than other groups of people will, that s just a statistical fact.

Everything else is  fake news. Spicer was asked during the briefing about the latest jobs report which showed America gaining a very healthy number of jobs. (There is no evidence to suggest this is due to Donald Trump, and in fact, it merely fits with the pattern of unrelenting job growth that came to define Obama s presidency. Trump has thus far done little to help the economy and nothing to help middle class workers, again suggesting this economic growth isn t the result of his presidency but merely his good fortune for having inherited a booming economy from his Democratic predecessor.)Despite the fact that there is little evidence of Trump s influence, his administration has been taking victory laps over the economic news. A reporter correctly noted that it s a bit odd that Trump would be so willing to trust the jobs report this time when he has previously gone on record to suggest that jobs reports under Obama were fabricated and false   a claim which, in 2015, earned him a  pants on fire  Politifact rating.

CNN s Jim Acosta asked Spicer,  Where is the proof?  Spicer said that  it s not a question of new proof or less proof or whatever,  but it s about bringing in Congress to get to the bottom of this.Then this happened:New York Times  Glenn Thrush followed up by pressing Spicer again on the evidence for Trump s claims, and after that Reuters  Ayesha Rascoe asked Spicer about whether Trump can just make declarative statements like that on Twitter and then get committees to look into it.Spicer went on to insist that going through the intelligence committees is the proper avenue for investigating. Rascoe asked whether we should, then, be taking Trump s tweets  at face value. Watch Spicer squirm:That s what you call a swing and a miss, Sean.White House spokesman Sean Spicer says WH will not present any proof of President Trump's allegation that President Obama committed a crime.

Like, for example, what the f*ck he s talking about. For sure, former President Barack Obama has no idea what Trump what Trump is referring to.Trump called Obama  bad  or  sick  during his tweet frenzy, all while offering no proof to back up his jaw-dropping claims.Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, which is also probing the scope of Russia s influence on the US election, said in a statement Saturday afternoon in regards to one of Trump s tweets this morning,  If there is something bad or sick going on, it is the willingness of the nation s chief executive to make the most outlandish and destructive claims without providing a scintilla of evidence to support them. No matter how much we hope and pray that this President will grow into one who respects and understands the Constitution, separation of powers, role of a free press, responsibilities as the leader of the free world, or demonstrates even the most basic regard for the truth, we must now accept that President Trump will never become that man,  Schiff said.Trump s baseless accusations backfired.

" The Fuse Is Lit: Legendary News Anchor Dan Rather Says Trump-Russia Scandal Is About To EXPLODE","Legendary news anchor Dan Rather said on Thursday that it shouldn t be long now before Donald Trump s cozy relationship with Russia becomes a real problem for him. Every once in a while in Washington, the fuse is lit for what seems to be a big scandal. Much more rarely does that fuse lead to an explosion of the magnitude we are seeing with Russia and the new Administration, and frankly the Republicans in Congress,  Rather wrote on Facebook.  How can anybody say, with all this billowing smoke and sights of actual flames, that there is no need to at least independently investigate whether a fire is burning down the very pillars of our democracy? The numerous investigations currently ongoing into the Trump campaign s  constant  contact with high-level Russian officials, Michael Flynn s resignation after it was revealed that he lied  bigly  about his relationship with Ambassador Sergey Kislyak   and, of course now the likelihood that notorious racist Jeff Sessions also perjured himself about his coziness with Kislyak, Rather says things are going to get bad quickly:The pressure is obviously starting to mount as leading Republicans are now calling for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. This comes in the wake of serious and credible evidence reported by a vigilant press that the Attorney General, mind you the top law enforcement man in the United States, perjured himself in testimony to the Senate about meeting the Russian ambassador during the election. Sessions is but the latest person close to President Trump who seems to be ensnared in a story that is more worthy of Hollywood melodrama than the reality of the governance of our country. Democrats are calling for Sessions to resign, and this story could move very quickly. We are well past the time for any political niceties or benefits of the doubt. We need an independent and thorough investigation of Russia s meddling in our democracy and its ties to the President and his allies,  Rather says.  We don t know what we don t know. Perhaps there are perfectly innocuous reasons for why Mr Trump won t release his tax returns, why he has continued to speak admirably about President Putin and why his aides and advisors seem to be so close to Russia. That s why we need an investigation. If the air is to be cleared, it needs to be cleared. And if there is deep rot, it needs to be exposed. And quickly. Rather says that the press is doing an  admirable  job at holding this administration to account, but  there is only so much it can do without such things as subpoena powers :Let s just make this clear. This is about a foreign and hostile power trying to influence our election while being in contact with close aides to the presidential campaign that the Kremlin wanted to win. Furthermore, there are serious questions about Mr Trump s longstanding ties to Russian money and influence peddlers. We don t know where this might go, but it isn t going away.Rather is right   things are looking pretty bad for Trump.

In some ways, this is an accurate statement.

They are living proof that when more options are provided to students, they are afforded greater access and greater quality,  she continued, failing to note that the difference in quality started with  no education  thanks to the racist Jim Crow-era education system.  Their success has shown that more options help students flourish. Their success is an example of the great things that can happen when people band together to overcome adversity, but HBCUs have nothing to do with  school choice  as DeVos claims.Naturally, people were quick to point out the extreme racism that was behind DeVos  statement.@nktpnd betsy devos: "rosa parks is a real pioneer when it comes to seat choice""  Sam Deutsch (@samdman95) February 28"," 2017Betsy DeVos said HBCUs were about school choice.

" Trump Demanded The Anne Frank Center Praise Him For Finally Denouncing Antisemitism; Their Response Is EPIC (TWEETS)","When White House spokesliar Sean Spicer demanded that the Anne Frank Center praise Donald Trump for, for the first time since he became President, denouncing the rash of antisemitic violence and other crime that has popped up since his election.Traditionally, Trump has been terrible with even acknowledging that bad things happen to Jewish people. even omitting them from his Holocaust announcement. But for the first time   that can t be emphasized enough   he named Jews as the actual victims of antisemitism: The anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community and community centers are horrible and are painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil. While some praised Trump for  finally doing the right thing, for most it was too little too late   especially when it s considered that his staff is overflowing with Nazis, white nationalists, white supremacists, alt-Righters, and other synonyms. His statement today is a pathetic asterisk of condescension after weeks in which he and his staff have committed grotesque acts and omissions reflecting Antisemitism, yet day after day have refused to apologize and correct the record,  Steven Goldstein, executive director of the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect, wrote in a Facebook post.  Make no mistake: The Antisemitism coming out of this Administration is the worst we have ever seen from any Administration.  He added: The White House repeatedly refused to mention Jews in its Holocaust remembrance, and had the audacity to take offense when the world pointed out the ramifications of Holocaust denial. And it was only yesterday, Presidents  Day, that Jewish Community Centers across the nation received bomb threats, and the President said absolutely nothing. When President Trump responds to Antisemitism proactively and in real time, and without pleas and pressure, that s when we ll be able to say this President has turned a corner. This is not that moment. I think he s been very forceful with his denunciation of people who seek to attack people because of their religion, because of their gender, because of the color of their skin,  Spicer lied in response.  It is something that he s going to continue to fight and make very, very clear has he has no place in this administration. Trump, of course, chose an  alt-right  scumbag named Stephen Miller, who has ties to white supremacist Richard Spencer, as a senior adviser and has handed anti-semitic, racist hatemonger Steve Bannon so much power that  many people are saying  he s actually the President. It s ironic that no matter how many times he talks about this, it s never good enough,  Spicer whined, ignoring that Trump literally has never actually defended persecuted  Jewish people before. The Anne Frank Center, he says, needs to get with the program and sing The Donald s praises: I wish that they had praised the president for his leadership in this area, and I think that hopefully as time continues to go by, they recognize his commitment to civil rights, to voting rights, to equality for all Americans.

During the interview, the Trump supporter and (until recently) CPAC headliner explained that he  is advocating  for man-on-child sex.Here is a longer cut where Milo Yiannopoulos says that he "is advocating"" for legal sex between 13 year olds! & older men. #CPAC2017 pic.twitter.com/1fiuv7TSKs  The Reagan Battalion (@ReaganBattalion) February 19"," 2017Though CPAC leadership has always been perfectly fine with Yiannopoulos claiming that Donald Trump grabbing women by the pussy isn t sexual assault and all the other horrific things he says and does"," the conservative icon was disinvited following  the revelations about what sort of person he is. Even the vile white supremacists at Breitbart have decided that he might have gone too far   and these are the people who worked under President Steve Bannon!But what probably hurts most about all this for Milo"
" Milo Might Have Gone Too Far This Time  Even For Breitbart (DETAILS)","Right-wing provocateur, Neo-Nazi, all around douchebag and Breitbart News editor Milo Yiannopoulos is finally getting his comeuppance for being a terrible human being. It seems that even the internet hellhole of misogynists, anti-Semites, racists, white supremacists, and other assorted bigots that is Breitbart has had enough of Milo since he came under fire for videos in which he openly defended pederasty. These revelations got him banned from speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), and now it seems that they may even cost him his job.The Hill is reporting that Milo s fellow employees at Breitbart are disgusted by his remarks, and a fair number of them are threatening to leave the company if Milo isn t given his walking papers. An unnamed senior editor leaked to the Washingtonian that Milo has been a problem for some time now, and that this is the straw that breaks the camel s back for  at least half a dozen  Breitbart employees: The fact of the matter is that there s been so many things that have been objectionable about Milo over the last couple of years, quite frankly. This is something far more sinister. If the company isn t willing to act, there are at least half a dozen people who are willing to walk out over it. Talking abut young boys and somehow seeking to ameliorate concerns over young boys  relationships with older men I m pretty sure everyone in the company would vomit upon hearing these words. What right-thinking person doesn t feel sick to their stomach when hearing something like that? Granted, considering the filth that is printed at Breitbart and the types of people who frequent the place, this reaction to Milo s defense of the indefensible here is hardly something that redeems them. But, at the end of the day, if Milo is shunned from polite society and has all of his platforms taken away, it s better for society as a whole. If he s too much for Breitbart, chances are he s too much for any other outlet or news network as well.UPDATE: It is also being reported that Simon & Schuster will not be publishing Milo s book, Dangerous.Simon & Schuster is canceling the publication of 'Dangerous' by Milo Yiannopoulos "After careful consideration."" Full story coming soon.

" CPAC Cowards Run For The Hills As Milo Pedophilia Controversy Heats Up (IMAGES)","Conservatives once again show that their sense of  morality  is really only dependent upon which way the political tide is blowing. First, they had proudly defended their decision to invite Alt-Right (read: Neo-Nazi) darling Milo Yiannopoulos to the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) as a star speaker. Now, Milo has said MANY things that are reprehensible to any decent person, regardless of political leanings. He has been openly racist, misogynist, otherwise bigoted, and has just generally been an all around trolling degenerate. That was no secret. But still, he was A-OKAY with the good folks who run the right-wing s biggest event of the year.However, right-wingers are cowards. When things get too hot, they run away like cockroaches. That is what has happened now that Milo has been caught on tape advocating for and defending pederasty. Given the obvious and understandable public outcry here, the CPAC folks have dropped Milo like a hot rock. Right-wing mouthpiece and leading CPAC organizer Matt Schlap tweeted the following announcement regarding his newfound rejection of Milo:"@ACUConservative has decided to rescind the invitation of Milo Yiannopoulos to speak at #CPAC2017."" pic.twitter.com/sVWGnPCW7C  Matt Schlapp (@mschlapp) February 20"," 2017Of course"," Milo has put up his own super defensive Facebook post regarding the matter:This seems to be a bit too far for even some of his rabid fans"

The Huffington Post reports:The House Oversight Committee chairman was challenged on Donald Trump s threat to eliminate Obamacare, his vow to slash support for women s health by cutting Planned Parenthood funds, a push to sell public lands and the confirmation of Betsy DeVos as education secretary. At one point, Chaffetz promised the voters that they would be  happy with the bill to abolish the Department of Education.  The crowd was not amused.Thousands of others who were not allowed in the auditorium because of police concerns about crowd control remained outside brandishing protest signs and chanting,  Chaffetz is a coward!

Because I do,  she said to loud cheers. I don t pretend to have all the answers,  he responded.  There are good people on both sides of the aisle,  he added to resounding boos.To add to his humiliation, a teacher stood up and humiliated Chaffetz, likening the Trump administration to her students and demanding to know where Chaffets draws his  line in the sand  with regard to the Trump family s conflicts of interest. His answer was shameful: Everyone has to comply with the law,  Chaffetz responded. You re really not going to like this part,  again to boos.

" Trump Throws All-Caps Tantrum After Appeals Courts Unanimous Decision To SHUT DOWN Muslim Ban (TWEETS)","If there s one takeaway from Thursday, it s that Donald Trump is probably going to lay in bed in that bathrobe he doesn t own and cry himself to sleep for days. In yet another blow to Trump s ego and victory for the Constitution, a federal appeals court became the third in the nation to tell The Donald to take his Muslim ban and shove it up his big orange ass.Trump s DOJ lawyers tried everything from claiming that the ban, which blocked people from seven predominantly Muslim countries that have not been tied to a deadly terrorist attack within our borders since 9/11 from entering the United States, is necessary to protect our nation, to actually attempting to get the court to agree that President Asterisk s decisions are absolute and unreviewable by any court. The Supreme Court has made clear that the Government s authority and expertise in [such] matters do not automatically trump the Court s own obligation to secure the protection that the Constitution grants to individuals, even in times of war,  the court said. There is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability, which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy.

" Twitter Has The ULTIMATE Way For SNL To Get Under Trumps Skin; It Involves ROSIE ODONNELL","It s no secret to anyone not living under a rock that there is no love lost between Donald Trump and Rosie O Donnell. It s also no secret that Alec Baldwin s brutal and spot-on mockery of Trump on Saturday Night Live is really getting under Trump s skin, and has been for some time now. However, the ultimate blow came this past Saturday night, when SNL featured a surprise appearance by actress Melissa McCarthy as Trump s bumbling, lying, combative press secretary Sean Spicer. The portrayal stole the show and went viral.While Trump has yet to tweet about it, the word on the street is that what bothered him the most about SNL s treatment of Spicer wasn t the mockery itself, but rather that Spicer was portrayed by a woman. To Trump, that equals making his press secretary look weak.Given this perfect storm of facts sure to be causing the notoriously thin-skinned president wannabe to seethe, Trump s own favorite social media platform, Twitter, has come up with a BRILLIANT way to have SNL finally make Trump REALLY blow his stack: Have Rosie O Donnell portray either Trump himself or   even better   top Trump political strategist Steve Bannon.Bannon is the former head of the white supremacist website Breitbart News, and is clearly the one who is in Trump s ear and pulling the strings behind the scenes. To have him portrayed by the woman Trump hates most in the world would be EPIC.

The Treasury Department often issues general licenses such as the one announced on Thursday to help U.S. companies overcome unintended business consequences of sanctions.U.S. intelligence agencies accused the FSB of involvement in hacking of Democratic organizations during the election, won by Republican Donald Trump.The agencies and private cyber security experts concluded the FSB first broke into the Democratic National Committee s computer system in the summer of 2015 and began monitoring email and chat conversations.They say FSB was one of two Russian spy agencies believed to have been involved in a wide-ranging operation by top-ranking individuals in Russia s government to discredit Democrat Hillary Clinton and help Trump win the election.When Obama imposed the sanctions, Vladimir Putin announced that he would wait to respond until after Trump became President because he expected a response that favors him. This move was just the first of many we can expect to benefit Vladimir Putin. This is the same group (FSB) that, just a month ago, our intelligence community determined was responsible for the attack on our democracy,  Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., ranking member of a House CIA subcommittee, said in response to Trump  rewarding  Putin for his help during the election.  We just made it easier for the same group to import into Russia the tools they could use to hack us or our allies again.

" Foreign Policy Insider: Trump Turned Off Recording During His Phone Call With Vladimir Putin","On Thursday, Donald Trump eased sanctions against Russia s spy agencies following a phone call last week with brutal Russian dictator and Trumpfriend Vladimir Putin. Details of the call have been scarce, limited to a vague, one-paragraph statement posted on the White House website:President Donald J. Trump received a congratulatory call today from Russian President Vladimir Putin. The call lasted approximately one hour and ranged in topics from mutual cooperation in defeating ISIS to efforts in working together to achieve more peace throughout the world including Syria. The positive call was a significant start to improving the relationship between the United States and Russia that is in need of repair. Both President Trump and President Putin are hopeful that after today s call the two sides can move quickly to tackle terrorism and other important issues of mutual concern.Many have been wondering why information about the specifics of the call has been so scarce. According to Ian Berman, vice president of the conservative-leaning American Foreign Policy Council, the reason is simple   Trump turned off the recording. On Wednesday, Bergman said at a forum on Russian-Turkish relations at the Bipartisan Policy Center that  there was no readout of the Trump-Putin call because [the] White House turned off recording. .@ilanberman: "there was no readout of the Trump-Putin call bc WH turned off recording""   Kremlin readout is very positive @BPC_Bipartisan pic.twitter.com/oi4v1R5dN0  ilhan tanir (@WashingtonPoint) February 1"," 2017The Kremlin s clearly sanitized readout sounds very nice"," if one ignored the fact that multiple intelligence agencies have confirmed that Putin personally spearheaded a massive hacking and propaganda campaign on Trump s behalf or that he began receiving his quid pro quo when The Donald eased sanctions against his spy agencies.

" Sean Spicer Refused To Define Betrayal So The Merriam-Webster Dictionary Did It For Him (TWEETS)","On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer refused to define the word  betrayal  after President Asterisk accused former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates of  betraying  the Justice Department by refusing to enforce his unconstitutional Muslim ban. Is it a betrayal? That s a very odd word,  one reporter asked Spicer. Another asked why the word was used. One, probably correctly assuming that Spicer just didn t know the definition, asked him to provide one. I m not going to define the word,  Spicer replied defiantly.

" Were Getting Hammered: GOP Lawmaker Feeling Pressure Over Obamacare Repeal (VIDEO)","Virginia Congressman Dave Brat is feeling the heat from his constituents, especially women. Republicans are moving to repeal Obamacare and his constituents are putting the pressure on him. Since Obamacare and these issues have come up, the women are in my grill no matter where I go,  he told a conservative audience at an event on Saturday.  They come up    When is your next town hall?  And believe me, it s not to give positive input. I had one woman on my Facebook say she was going to get up in my grill,  he said.  There s paid protesters   paid activists on the far left, not my Democratic friends I go to church with. They re being paid to go around and raise havoc. We re getting hammered,  Brat added.There is a Facebook page dedicated to the Virginia Republican which uses the hashtag #AskBrat so it doesn t appear that they re  paid. Karen Conley of Henrico County said she called Brat s office recently to express support for the Affordable Care Act, which keeps her family insured. Nobody is being paid or put up to this by an outside organization,  Conley said.  Everybody is putting in their time and effort because they re dissatisfied with the representation. They feel dismissed, and that their concerns aren t valid because they re not being responded to. It s not just a partisan issue anymore. Alsuin Preis, another of Brat s constituents, said many of the people who are trying to meet with the congressman had supported him during his campaign. This is not about going to a town hall about haranguing Dave Brat or just throwing out jabs,  Preis told WTVR-TV.  We want to discuss our concerns. Brat plans to hold town hall meetings after the first 100 days of the Donald Trump administration. Over the past couple of weeks my office has been inundated with phone calls, and emails and comments on social media requesting a town hall meeting, and believe me, I fully intend to have plenty of town halls that are open and transparent as soon as our first 100 days agenda is implemented and we come up for a breath of air,  Brat wrote on Facebook.Some of Brat s constituents are requesting a town hall meeting before the first 100 days of Trump s alleged presidency.Watch:(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js"," fjs);}(document"," 'script'"
" Fox News Rushes To ID Mosque Attacker As Moroccan Muslim  Hes A White, Christian, Nazi Trump Fan (TWEETS)","Want evidence that Fox News is a functional mouthpiece for the Trump administration? On Monday, the most watched news network in America lied to you. While it may see shocking that an American news agency would push blatant lies, they seem to have had a direct source  the Trump White House.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer kicked off his press conference by claiming (falsely) that the attacker was both a Muslim and from Morocco.  It s a terrible reminder of why we must remain vigilant and why the President is taking steps to be proactive rather than reactive when it comes to our nation s safety and security, Spicer said at this afternoon s briefing when speaking of the Quebec City attack.Fox News reported the same information despite that it was never confirmed, tweeting it out in an almost celebratory fashion:Naturally, things got a bit embarrassing for the network   and Spicer, who is already dealing with the aftermath of saying that it s not only right but necessary to handcuff 5-year-old Muslim children and treat them like terrorists   when information surfaced that he wasn t from Morocco or a Muslim. In fact, he s a huge fan of Donald J. Trump:The actual shooting suspect is 27-year-old Alexandre Bissonnette, a white French Canadian who is, by all appearances, a rabid anti-immigrant nationalist. A leader of a local immigration rights groups, Fran ois Deschamps, told a local paper he recognized his photo as an anti-immigrant far-right  troll  who has been hostile to the group online. And Bisonnette s Facebook page   now taken down but still archived  lists among its  likes  the far right French nationalist Marine Le Pen, Islam critics Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens, the Israeli Defense Forces, and Donald J. Trump (he also  likes  the liberal Canadian Party NDP along with more neutral  likes  such as Tom Hanks, the Sopranos and Katy Perry).Fox News responded by changing a few lines in their original report and never actually issuing a retraction or apology. In fact, as of 7:06 P.M. EST, the tweet is still live:Suspect in Quebec mosque terror attack was of Moroccan origin, reports show https://t.co/oRzxGHEXDm pic.twitter.com/aEsEtccMvi  Fox News (@FoxNews) January 30, 2017While it is true that police did question a Moroccan man, the guy was a worshiper and a witness to the attack   not a suspect as conservatives have been saying. In fact, as the person who called the cops in the first place, he was never treated by police as anything other than a witness. Conservative media, on the other hand, just went with it.Naturally, Fox News, Spicer, and all who believed their wacky story found themselves facing, well, quite a bit of mockery for this desperate attempt to blame the deadly attack on Muslims:Fox News was only tryin' to be polite givin' the Moroccan suspect top billin'. Bissonnette liked Trump and Le Pen on Facebook. pic.twitter.com/S1a3tuQhwK  Tea Pain (@TeaPainUSA) January 30, 2017The Moroccan man who people ran with as the suspect was actually a worshipper and witness.

" Twitter F*cks Trump Up After He Says Senators Who Oppose Muslim Ban Are Trying To Start World War III (TWEETS)","Trump has signed a stream of executive orders stripping federal funding from international, non-governmental health organizations that so much as mention abortion, authorizing a gigantic wall to keep brown people out of our country to create a gigantic  safe space  for his racist followers and authorizing concentration camps in which to keep the millions of immigrants he rounds up, and   in a move that literally mobilized the world against him   enacting a partial ban on Muslims entering the United States, including dual citizens, legal permanent residents, students, people with jobs, and others he considers dangerous.Even the most casual observer can see that Donald Trump s horrific policies are doing nothing but creating a destabilized environment not only in the United States, but worldwide.  On Sunday, Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham released a joint statement warning that Trump s Muslim ban is a  self-inflicted wound  in the fight against terrorism. Our most important allies in the fight against ISIL are the vast majority of Muslims who reject its apocalyptic ideology of hatred,  the senators said  [Trump s] executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country. That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security. We should not stop green-card holders from returning to the country they call home. We should not stop those who have served as interpreters for our military and diplomats from seeking refuge in the country they risked their lives to help,  the senators, added. And we should not turn our backs on those refugees who have been shown through extensive vetting to pose no demonstrable threat to our nation, and who have suffered unspeakable horrors, most of them women and children. Trump could take this message to heart, pausing for a glorious moment of self-reflection, and apologize to the world for his actions. He could fire the white supremacists, Kremlin cronies, and imbeciles with which he has stacked his cabinet and replace them with people who will work for the good of the country, once and for all cementing himself as a true legend among world leaders. Trump could apologize to the Muslim community   but that s just not the guy he is.In a statement on Twitter, which is apparently where the President releases important information now, Trump responded to the senators  condemnation of his bigoted executive order, which was literally written by a white supremacist, by informing the world that McCain and Graham are trying to  start World War III  by saying that we shouldn t ban Muslims from our country.The joint statement of former presidential candidates John McCain & Lindsey Graham is wrong   they are sadly weak on immigration.

" Trump Just Signed Away Our Environment, And Americans Are Sick Of His Bullsh*t (TWEETS)","Donald Trump betrayed Americans on Tuesday by proving to be exactly as large an environmental threat as was predicted. Trump gloated on Twitter that he was signing authorizations to move forward both with the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines. Signing orders to move forward with the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines in the Oval Office,  Trump tweeted Tuesday afternoon. The Washington Post reports:Dealing a blow to former President Barack Obama s legacy on climate change, President Donald Trump signed executive actions Tuesday to advance the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines, a move cheered by congressional Republicans and decried by environmentalists.Trump told reporters at the White House that the actions on the pipelines will be subject to the terms and conditions being negotiated by U.S. officials.Not everyone is happy about Trump s new order.  Americans know this pipeline was unfairly rerouted towards our nation and without our consent. The existing pipeline route risks infringing on our treaty rights, contaminating our water and the water of 17 million Americans downstream,  said Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock tribe with whom thousands upon thousands of protesters have joined in opposition to a plan to route the Dakota pipeline under a lake near the tribe s reservation. Such a move, anyone with critical thinking skills realizes, would threaten the area s water supply and sacred Native American sites.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers agreed late last year to begin an environmental assessment and consider alternative routes, but it is unclear what will happen now that Trump has given his go-ahead.

" Trump Gets Revenge On Womens March By Signing Executive Order That Will Kill A Bunch Of Women And Girls","How mad is Trump that millions of women made him look like a fool? Mad enough to kill, apparently. While he can t order the executions of American women for defying him yet President Pussygrabber did the next best thing. He signed an executive order that will lead to the deaths of multitudes of women and girls worldwide.On Monday, The Donald continued the path of destruction he began with his first executive order attacking Obamacare by unleashing an assault on the women and girls of the world. One of Trump s growing number of executive orders reinstates the  global gag rule,  which blocks federal funding for international, nongovernmental organizations that provide or  promote  abortions.In short, if your organization were to partner with Planned Parenthood to inform girls and women across the globe about reproductive health like, say, the Clinton Foundation, people like Trump could argue that you are  promoting  abortion by mentioning it as a medically legitimate option.The policy was originally developed by President Ronald Reagan in 1984. Ever since then, Presidents who care about human rights like Obama and Clinton have been rescinding it. Republicans, however, being part of a party that combats women s rights at every turn, typically reinstate it.How harmful is it? Mother Jones reports:According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, women in poor countries suffer the most from this policy. A 2003 analysis found that the rule leads to unsafe abortions, which are the second-leading cause of death for women of reproductive age in Ethiopia and account for more than 40 percent of the maternal mortality rate in Kenya. Peru has one of the highest maternal mortality rates in Latin America, in part because of its high rate of clandestine abortions.The United States currently spends about $600 million annually on family planning and reproductive health programs in foreign countries. The Guttmacher Institute, a think tank that studies reproductive health care, estimates that a loss of this funding would translate to 38,000 more abortions. Marie Stopes International, one of USAID s biggest family planning partners, estimates that the global gag rule will lead to an additional 2.2 million abortions worldwide.Trump s order comes on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade and directly follows a nationwide three-million women march against Trump and his hate.

Trump would never appoint someone who is completely unqualified to any position.

I will refer back to Senator Enzi and the school he was talking about in Wyoming,  DeVos said.  I would imagine that there is probably a gun in the schools to protect from potential grizzlies.

Meryl Streep was definitely one of them, and she was able to put into words what many of us were feeling, destroying Trump last night at the Golden Globes: An actor s only job is to enter the lives of people who are different from us and let you feel what that feels like,  she said.  And there were many, many, many powerful performances this year that did exactly that   breathtaking, compassionate work. There was one performance this year that stunned me. It sank its hooks in my heart. Not because it was good  there was nothing good about it   but it was effective, and it did its job. It made its intended audience laugh and show their teeth. It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter: someone he outranked in privilege, power and the capacity to fight back.

We all knew he d go there, but on Monday Donald Trump deigned it appropriate to attack Meryl Streep after she made some rather pointed remarks about accepting others in her speech at the Golden Globes. Without naming Trump by name, she managed to twist the knife deep in The Donald s abdomen with very little effort. There was one performance this year that stunned me. It sank its hooks in my heart,  Streep said, referencing Trump s attacks on a disabled New York Times reporter last year.  Not because it was good, there was nothing good about it, but it was effective and it did its job. It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter,  she continued.  Someone he outranked in privilege, power and the capacity to fight back. It kind of broke my heart when I saw it and I still can t get it out of my head because it wasn t in a movie, it was real life,  Streep said.  This instinct to humiliate when it s modeled by someone in the public   by someone powerful, it filters down into everyone s life because it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same. Calling on the press to  hold power to account,  Streep very correctly pointed out that  When the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose. Naturally, this was too much for Trump to handle. In an interview with the New York Times Monday morning, Trump denied mocking anyone at all. I was never mocking anyone,  Mr. Trump said.  I was calling into question a reporter who had gotten nervous because he had changed his story.  Trump, of course, was referencing a 15-year-article written by Serge F. Kovaleski that he had attempted to use to prove that Muslims were celebrating in the streets.In reality, Kovaleski correctly reported that police, swept up in the paranoia directly following 9/11, had detained a number of people who had allegedly celebrated. Ultimately, there was one account of people  celebrating in the streets  at the time and it was five young Israeli men, who were certainly not Muslims. People keep saying I intended to mock the reporter s disability, as if Meryl Streep and others could read my mind, and I did no such thing, he told the Times. And remember, Meryl Streep introduced Hillary Clinton at her convention, and a lot of these people supported Hillary. He then took to Twitter to attack Streep as  one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood  and a  Hillary flunky who lost big.

In other words, you re paying for the wall and Mexico will still not be paying for it later, but at least Trump can get it built.Trump s team has made a number of wacky proposals related to paying for the wall, including amending the Patriot Act to include wire transfers as accounts that could be frozen and otherwise punishing Mexico for their refusal to fund what could possibly be the most fiscally irresponsible undertaking since, well, any of the bazillion businesses Trump has bankrupted. They have even discussed tying it to the appropriations process, which could force Democrats to agree to funding to keep the government from shutting down   but, once again, don t worry, Mexico will totally pay us back.

Even when presented with evidence of the hack, Trump has gone the route of repeatedly assaulting those who uncovered the information rather than the foreign leader who directly meddled in our election   all while praising the guy who masterminded the attacks on our nation.On Sunday, Trump tweeted out a quote from his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, that pretty much sums up his entire administration.

Russia did indeed hack our election, 2.) the hack was meant to get Donald Trump elected, and Wikileaks was definitely used to disseminate the hacked documents, The Donald somehow managed to leave the meeting more sure than ever that he is right.Friday night, he went straight to his favorite pastime: victim blaming.

Had he listened in his meeting, he would know that the report did not actually look into whether the hack impacted the election results:We did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election. The US Intelligence Community is charged with monitoring and assessing the intentions, capabilities, and actions of foreign actors; it does not analyze US political processes or US public opinion.But what this all comes down to is ego, according to Trump. He doesn t mean his, of course, but he feels that Democrats  fragile little egos were crushed because  the loss by the Dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed!

Not only had it been obvious enough that Hillary Clinton called him out for it numerous times during the runup to the election, but The Donald has been singing Putin s praises almost constantly for a year now and exhausting a lot of effort filling every appointed position he can with people who are likely to be very, very friendly to Russia (including men who directly worked for and with Russian officials).The CIA and FBI, as well as more than a dozen other intelligence agencies, all agree that Russia hacked our election.

According to the New York Times, Kelly will be jumping ship to NBC where she will hist a daytime news and discussion program, anchor her own weekend show, and be a part of the network s special political coverage.This may or may not come as a shock to Fox, whose ousted former chairman Roger Ailes sexually harassed Kelly for about a decade, but perhaps they might be having some  hindsight  issues surrounding their recent decision to side with Trump over Kelly when The Donald was bullying her on social media, regular media, and everywhere else imaginable after she challenged him during a debate.Whatever her reason for leaving, she is passing up a pretty sweet $20 million a year that Fox offered her to stay after her current contract expires. NBC has been crystal clear that they can not and will not match that money. Sources declined to tell the New York Times what, exactly, Kelly s annual salary will be, but she is almost assuredly taking a pay cut based on past remarks.While it is entertaining to see Kelly  stick it to  Fox News, we have no choice but to wonder why NBC would hire someone who thinks that Santa and Jesus are both real (and white dudes), who blamed Sandra Bland for her own death, who thinks that pepper spray is a  food product, essentially,  and who has done and said so many horrific things over the years that a truly functional society would treat her as a pariah   though, of course, she was one of the few right-wing voices who actually stood up to Donald Trump to some degree.Naturally, Trump fans are celebrating the news:Megyn Kelly is moving to NBC!

" Twitter DESTROYS Trump After He Whines That Eric Cant Sell Access To His Administration (TWEETS)","In case you haven t heard, Eric Trump recently had to cancel an auction in which he was using his charity as a front to sell access to his father s administration. Recently the Eric Trump Foundation announced an auction for coffee with his sister, incoming First Lady Ivanka, who will be serving as an adviser to her father and occupying the space in the White House normally reserved for the President s spouse.To any casual onlooker, this is exactly the sort of situation that used to cause Trump to scream  lock her up,  but now that he s President, the obvious conflict of interest presented by the sale of access to those closest to the President-elect doesn t matter much to him. On Friday, The Donald took to Twitter to whine that his family can t sell access to his administration:My wonderful son, Eric, will no longer be allowed to raise money for children with cancer because of a possible conflict of interest with  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2016my presidency. Isn't this a ridiculous shame? He loves these kids, has raised millions of dollars for them, and now must stop. Wrong answer!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2016Now, nothing is stopping any of the Trumps from donating their own money, or encouraging direct donations to St. Jude, the organization that was allegedly going to receive the money (anytime the Trumps and charity are mentioned,  allegedly  is appropriate until it actually happens). But for them to think it is in any way OK to sell access to Ivanka no matter the reason is just asinine. It s conflicts like this that caused Obama to prohibit members of his family from directly raising money for anyone, no matter the cause:The Obama administration prohibited any member of the first family from directly soliciting charitable donations, said Norm Eisen, who served as an ethics lawyer early in President Obama s tenure. Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, have attended occasional charitable fund-raising events, including the Congressional Black Caucus annual dinners. The Obamas also allowed their daughters  high school to auction off magazines they had signed, Mr. Eisen said, but they did not auction off access to themselves. You never, ever want to have government officials using their public office for the private gain, even for a worthy charity,  Mr. Eisen said.  That was how we did it. Eric Trump, like his father, whined that he can t raise money by selling his sister despite getting by just fine without that sort of thing in the past. I get that people will try to use anything they can for their own interests,  Trump said.  The reality is, I ve been raising money for sick kids far longer than  his dad has been involved in politics,  Eric Trump told the New York Times, though he did explain that he understands  the quagmire  presented by what he had hoped he would not get caught doing.Naturally, in what is almost becoming a daily ritual, Twitter swarmed Trump s morning bloviating whinefest and once again hammered him into oblivion:@realDonaldTrump Sorry your children can't get the tax deduction on your name.

While the mainstream media portrays these people as   what did they say? Oh, yes,  economically anxious rather than racist, violent, deplorable, xenophobic, or any of the bazillion terms that can properly be applied to such individuals, the rest of us had no problem telling it like it is. Even Trump, who regularly blasted anyone who insulted his precious little snowflakes, now seems willing to admit that they are awful people. He s just OK with it (until anyone who isn t him calls them what they are, of course).Following the obvious response to The Donald applying terms to his followers that previously were verboten in his eyes, Trump tweeted perhaps the stupidest thing he has tweeted in a while (and that s saying a lot) on Sunday.

The Wall Street Journal reports:The incident on Thursday occurred days after President-elect Donald J. Trump raised China s ire by suggesting his administration could abandon a bedrock agreement on Taiwan s status that has kept peace in the area for decades. Mr. Trump s suggestion that the U.S. would maintain its position on Taiwan only if China makes concessions to American interests came after he broke decades of diplomatic protocol by accepting a phone call from Taiwan s president, hitting one of Beijing s most sensitive issues.

Video of the incident has gone viral, reminding the nation of exactly what brand of hate they elected. Because of the strong emotions and intensity of rhetoric that the posting of this incident to social media has elicited, we have had parents express concern regarding student safety,  Superintendent of Schools Shawn Lewis-Lakin said in a statement on Thursday.

That person is, of course, Republican Donald J. Trump.  Trump has managed to do a million things that would have destroyed any other candidate s campaign, but still he powered on to win the GOP nomination.During this travesty of a campaign, Trump s wife Melania has largely been absent from the campaign trail. She has been visible at the debates in the family box, of course, but hasn t said a word since she was humiliated by giving a conventions speech that was plagiarized from First Lady Michelle Obama s 2008 speech at the Democratic National Convention.

Here is the exchange, via The Hill: It s kinda like two teenage boys   actually they should behave better, right?  the potential first lady said about her husband and former  Access Hollywood  host Billy Bush.

It s set his campaign into a tailspin and even his running mate, Mike Pence, is now calling out Trump.Pence made his remarks in a statement Saturday where he wrote:  As a husband and father, I was offended by the words and actions described by Donald Trump in the eleven-year-old video released yesterday. I do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them. I am grateful that he has expressed remorse and apologized to the American people.

Except for the fact that Lee went a step further and pleaded with Trump to drop out of the race. Two other Republican Senators have called for Trump to drop out after hearing the audio.

" Eric Trump PATHETICALLY Attempts To Defend Daddys Latest 3 A.M. Temper Tantrum On Twitter","Everyone involved with Donald Trump s campaign seems to have one job, and it s the same job: Explaining why whatever completely horrible thing Trump said or did, this time, is really totally okay. Today, it s Eric Trump s turn to justify daddy s latest 3 a.m. temper tantrum on Twitter, in which he told voters to  check out  a former Miss Universe s non-existent  sex tape. Speaking to Fox News on Tuesday, Eric said that at least it proves his father doesn t sleep, even though this can admittedly be a  downfall  sometimes. At least my father s up at 3 o clock in the morning, right? Which, you know, is great. Maybe that energy is sometimes a little bit of a downfall of his, but he s an amazing guy, and he ll be there to answer the call, you know, when things go bad. And, you know, I think people appreciate that. Not everyone sees Trump s lack of sleep as a virtue, though. Some of The Donald s opponents say his late night Twitter rants are proof of just how unfit for office he is. What kind of a man stays up all night to smear a woman with lies and conspiracy theories?  his rival Hillary Clinton asked last week.Vice President Joe Biden took aim at Trump s early morning tweetstorm on Monday during a rally in Orlando, Fl. You don t have to be a psychologist or psychiatrist. But what kind of leader awakens at 3 o clock in the morning and tweets Hillary helped  disgusting Alicia M. become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in a debate ? Or 3:30 in the morning. This guy wants to be president of the United States of America?  Biden said.In Trump s Twitter rant, he claimed that Clinton had been  duped  by Alicia Machado, a former Miss Universe who had been fat-shamed by the GOP nominee and suggested that the Democratic nominee had helped her gain citizenship.Wow, Crooked Hillary was duped and used by my worst Miss U.

It s now not as politically convenient for Trump to still push this issue considering he now has to try to win over the opposing side of the topic.Trump said: President Obama was born in the United States. Period. Now, we want to get back to making America strong and great again. Profound, really. And absolutely pathetic.Here s the thing, though, Trump is full of absolute horseshi*t because he was the Birther-in-Chief back half a decade ago, even going so far as to claim credit for the fact that Obama released his birth certificate. And even after that, Trump still had his many doubts over its authenticity.There s even video of him from 2011 stating how much he believes this is a very valid issue that needs to be looked into. He even went so far as to say calling those who wanted to see the birth certificate  birthers  was  derogatory  because they re actually  on to something. And ever the political opportunist, he said: People love this issue   especially in the Republican Party. So, when you hear Trump say that  President Obama was born in the United States. Period,  remember what he really thought and likely still thinks. You can also tell he s doing it for pandering purposes because he ended his announcement with his damn campaign slogan.Those who haven t caught on to how absolutely smarmy Trump is, need to wake up and wake up fast.Kyle Griffin of MSNBC s Last Word posted the video on Twitter:Trump on birtherism in 2011: "People love this issue   especially in the Republican Party."" https://t.co/6I6WKsC4DI pic.twitter.com/6eza8loaoN  Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) September 16"," 2016Featured image via video screen capture"",News

" Team Trump Cant Get Their Immigration Message Straight, So Hillary Does It For Them","Donald Trump s signature issue since he began his travesty of a presidential campaign has been immigration.

Well, that was the primary, and this is general election. He and his campaign staff seem to have realized that they can t win with just a bunch of racists, so they are attempting to moderate that hardline message, but they have to be careful, because the base still has to be fed that red meat that got them onto Team Trump in the first place.The result of this attempted balancing act has been a muddying of the water amongst Trump s campaign staff and surrogates as they chase their tails all over television with no clear message regarding what will happen to all of the undocumented immigrants who are already here and contributing to American society.

Therefore, former Mexican President Vicente Fox has decided to weigh in on the situation.Appearing on CNN, Fox said: I m sure he s going to be rejected by everybody here in Mexico. We cannot accept this going on. And yes, it could be a desperate move.   To me, it is a desperate move on both sides. Fox went on to say that Trump  is not welcome to Mexico,  and continued: We don t like him. We don t want him. Fox also criticized current President Pena Nieto for entertaining Trump s visit: I think President Pena is taking an enormous political risk by hosting Trump,  going on to call Pena Nieto s decision a  big mistake.  Fox also straight   out apologized for the visit and the president s insistence on going along with it: I really apologize for our president taking this step forward. After that, Fox turned his attentions to Trump himself, and his many hypocrisies regarding the issues of immigration and trade: How can you believe him when we are hearing right now that he and his wife violated migration laws in the United States?How can he speak about trade war when he s manufacturing all his products for his business outside of the United States? It s absolutely incongruent, absolutely inconsistent. Fox then appealed directly to Americans, warning us of Trump s incompetence when it comes to being president: I just cannot envision him sitting on that chair that was the chair of President Washington, President Jefferson, President Kennedy, President Reagan   all the great presidents that nation has had.This guy is not up to be a president. Of course, Trump, unwilling to let any criticism go, actually tried to lie regarding a proposed visit with Vicente Fox.

" Ana Navarro Lets Trump Know EXACTLY What Latinos Have To Lose By Voting For Him (VIDEO)","Donald Trump and his campaign know that they stand an ice cube s chance in hell at winning the presidential election unless they can sway some of the minority vote. As it stands now the campaign has next to nothing in the realm of that voting block.So, what is Trump doing to try to get some of that vote? He s pandering to African-Americans and Latinos, of course. However, he s doing a terrible job of it.He s literally asking minority voters: What do you have to lose? As though that s all the reasoning they d ever need to vote for him. As if minority voters are going to show up to the voting booth in November, look at the ballot, and say,  eh, why not Trump? What do I have to lose?

I mean, he can t be that dumb, right? Who knows, really. Clearly, his current supporters are.Well, not letting Trump get away with being such a pathetic pandering fool, Ana Navarro, a conservative mind you, tells Trump exactly what they have to lose.On CNN Navarro stated: I don t speak for all Hispanics. I speak for myself. Maybe the eighty plus percent of Hispanics who don t approve of him, some of them may agree with me. I think what we have to lose, is our dignity. Our sense of self-worth. I think what we have to lose is our moral compass. I think that if we allow ourselves to vote for a man who has been making textbook racist remarks, and in my book that makes him a racist, for over a year, against Hispanics. Against immigrants. You are voting against your own self-interests. I think that we would lose our political leverage. We would lose any power. If we allow somebody who has been bashing us for over a year to win the presidency. It means the Hispanic vote does not matter. So, that s my answer to Donald Trump.

" Evan McMullin: Never In His Life Has Trump Had To Watch His Mouth (VIDEO)","Donald Trump s mouth gets him into trouble a lot. There have been endless examples of his inability to curb what he says, which in and of itself means that he is disqualified from the presidency. There are many right-wingers who are so terrified of Trump that they are backing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, and while others won t vote for Clinton, they won t vote for Trump, either.Well, now, conservatives have another option: Former CIA operative Evan McMullin. While he has never held public office, McMullin is certainly a sight better than Trump. His candidacy, at this late stage of the 2016 race, is most likely just a way to stop Trump; after all, he entered the race far too late to gain any real traction, and Independent bids for the presidency in America always fail spectacularly. However, thanks to the outrageous nature of Trump s candidacy, McMullin is definitely shaking things up.Appearing on ABC s This Week, McMullin had quite a few choice words for Trump. He said: He s not a credible candidate. It s clear, the numbers, the fact that Donald Trump can t control what he says. He s never had to control what he said. Never in life has he had to do that. It s unrealistic to expect him to do that now. McMullin went on to make the case for voters to consider him instead of one of the two major party candidates: We need someone who will bring this country together. I firmly believe that the time has come in this country for a new generation of leadership, and that certainly is not Donald Trump nor [Democratic nominee] Hillary Clinton.

" Trump: Giving Me This Purple Heart Is Much Easier Than Earning It Myself (VIDEO)","The rally in Virginia on Tuesday for Donald Trump went down as well as one would expect. The GOP presidential nominee, who was also a recipient of five deferments during the Vietnam War, bragged that one of his supporters who is a retired Lieutenant Colonel, gifted him with a Purple Heart medal. Just to be clear, this happened at the same venue in which Donald kicked a baby out of the rally. I said to him,  Is that like the real one, or is that a copy?  Donald said.Politico reports: Trump recounted the exchange, remarking that the man, who he identified as retired Lt. Col. Louis Dorfman said,  That s my real Purple Heart. I have such confidence in you. And I said,  Man, that s like big stuff. I always wanted to get the Purple Heart,  Donald continued.  This was much easier. At that point, Donald invited Dorfman to appear onstage with him on camera, so the two men then posed for photographs with Trump giving a thumbs-up before placing the Purple Heart back in his pocket.And none of this is weird (wink wink) after Donald s attacks on Humayun Khan s parents, whose son actually earned a Purple Heart. The Army Captain was remembered by soldiers who served with him as a selfless patriot.At any rate, Trump then told the crowd that he had asked Dorfman to speak, but that the man responded, saying,  No, sir.

Trump s answer is so completely ignorant that it definitively proves that Trump has a childlike understanding of current foreign affairs.While being questioned about Vladamir Putin and the GOP s stance regarding Ukraine, Trump insisted that Putin is not moving into Crimea   despite the fact that Putin had already moved into Crimea in 2014. He s not going into Ukraine, OK, just so you understand. He s not going to go into Ukraine, all right? You can mark it down. You can put it down. You can take it anywhere you want,  Trump said. Well, he s already there, isn t he?  Stephanopoulos responded.Trump said: OK   well, he s there in a certain way. But I m not there. You have Obama there. And frankly, that whole part of the world is a mess under Obama with all the strength that you re talking about and all of the power of NATO and all of this. In the meantime, he s going away. He takes Crimea. Trump then seemed to imply that Russia had a greater claim to the Crimean than the Ukraine. I m going to take a look at it,  Trump said.  But you know, the people of Crimea, from what I ve heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were. And you have to look at that, also   just so you understand, that was done under Obama s administration. Trump went on to say: And as far as the Ukraine is concerned, it s a mess. And that s under the Obama s administration with his strong ties to NATO. So with all of these strong ties to NATO, Ukraine is a mess. Crimea has been taken. Don t blame Donald Trump for that.

" WATCH: Trump Surrogate Tries To Defend Trump Sacrifice Interview And Fails Hard"," It s a trap!  That s the messaging that the Trump campaign has decided to go with when asked about Trump s response to the father of a Muslim man who died while serving as an American Army captain overseas. It s a narrative that the Trump campaign uses often   if Trump says something horrible on camera it s because the media twisted his words. One of Trump s surrogates, Scottie Nell Hughes, tried to use this tactic during a segment on CNN s New Day on Sunday morning.The father, Khizr Khan, spoke at the Democratic National Convention, where he called out Trump for his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States. Khan said during his speech that Trump has sacrificed nothing or no one in his life.Trump, a billionaire, responded by saying: I think I ve made a lot of sacrifices. I work very, very hard. I ve created thousands and thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs, built great structures. I ve had tremendous success. I think I ve done a lot. This response came out during an interview with George Stephanopoulos.Hughes says that she was initially disappointed with Trump s comments about Khan. However, once she realized that the interview was a part of the media s agenda to make Trump look bad, which is apparently something he could never do on his own in the mind of a Trump supporter, she has to tell people the truth   it s all a giant media conspiracy. Now that I ve read the questions and the Trump campaign and others have released the full transcript, you can see what a setup this is. Which was nothing but to trap Mr. Trump going forward. The truth is that Trump is trapped. He is trapped by the vile rhetoric that he has spewed throughout the primary election. He went full fascist and it is preventing him from being able to effectively pivot more to the middle in order to win the votes he needs to win a general election.Hughes, like many other Trump supporters, are in for a rude awakening when if they are capable of doing so   they realize that they backed a losing candidate.You can watch Hughes desperately try to rationalize Trump s horrendous comments below.#Trump to #KhizrKhan "I've made a lot of sacrifices"" @VictorBlackwell gets reax from @scottienhughes @asbthelawhttps://t.co/imMsHa8ARQ  New Day (@NewDay) July 31"," 2016Featured image via video screen capture"",News

However, their presumptive nominee made a MASSIVE mistake in the wake of all of this, and actually made the laughable claim that he would be a better ally to LGBTQ people than Hillary Clinton would.

" Crybaby Trump Revokes Washington Post Press Credentials, Newspaper Responds With Middle Finger","On Monday, Donald Trump accused the President of the United States of being an ISIS sympathizer and when the Washington Post reported on it, he threw a tantrum that culminated in his taking the unprecedented step of banning one of the biggest newspapers in the country from having access to his campaign. To put that in its proper context, during the height of the Watergate scandal, an event begun by two Washington Post reporters, President Richard Nixon didn t even try to pull press credentials. It was literally unthinkable.On Facebook, Trump went on a rant about how unfair the Washington Post was being for accurately quoting him.I am no fan of President Obama, but to show you how dishonest the phony Washington Post is, they wrote,  Donald Trump suggests President Obama was involved with Orlando shooting  as their headline. Sad!Based on the incredibly inaccurate coverage and reporting of the record setting Trump campaign, we are hereby revoking the press credentials of the phony and dishonest Washington Post.To be clear, Trump is   as is often the case   openly and unapologetically lying. Earlier in the day, he went on Fox News and remarked that the reason Obama can t stop terror attacks in the United States is because he doesn t want to. We re led by a man who is a very   look, we re led by a man that either is, is not tough, not smart, or he s got something else in mind. And the something else in mind, you know, people can t believe it. People cannot   they cannot believe that President Obama is acting the ways he acts and can t even mention the words radical Islamic terrorism. There s something going on. It s inconceivable. And when reporters asked him to clarify, he refused, and cryptically added that he would let people decide for themselves what he meant. Trump  who has been on record for years as being a birther  knows what conclusions his fans will draw. Why rock the boat by turning that particular dog whistle into a bull horn?By one count, Trump has banned at least seven media outlets from covering his campaign due to unflattering treatment. (This doesn t include the news programs or journalists whom Trump simply refuses to talk to because of personal beefs.)We count at least 7 outlets Trump has barred from events Nat Review, Daily Beast, HuffPo, Buzzfeed, WaPo, Politico, DMR, who else?  Alexandra Jaffe (@ajjaffe) June 13, 2016A few more: Mother Jones and Univision. There are likely others. There will likely be more soon.So when the Washington Post was added to the list, the paper s editor Marty Baron released a scathing statement calling Trump on his fascistic view towards the free press. Donald Trump s decision to revoke The Washington Post s press credentials is nothing less than a repudiation of the role of a free and independent press. When coverage doesn t correspond to what the candidate wants it to be, then a news organization is banished. The Post will continue to cover Donald Trump as it has all along honorably, honestly, accurately, energetically, and unflinchingly. We re proud of our coverage, and we re going to keep at it. In short, don t expect the Washington Post to just roll over. They are going to continue to go after Trump wherever and whenever he tries to pull a fast one on the American people.Trump has also flirted with the idea of getting rid of the free press altogether once he is president. On at least one occasion Trump told his supporters that he would open up libel laws and viciously and aggressively sue any media outlet that tries to criticize him.

" Tom Morello: Muhammad Alis Legacy Is Being Whitewashed  The Worst Offender Is Trump (VIDEO)","During a segment of HBO s Real Time with Bill Maher, Prophets of Rage guitarist Tom Morello sat down with the show s host Bill Maher where they discussed the legacy of Muhammed Ali.Maher described the influence that the late boxing champion had on himself and the world, saying: He invented hip-hop. It was completely revolutionary. For everyone who is younger, who grew up in a world of hip-hop, where braggadocio is a big part of life. You know I used to say, rap is affirmative action for the ego. Morello agreed with Maher, saying that Ali had influenced himself, saying that he was particularly attracted to Ali because of how unapologetic his attitude was. Morello also went on to comment on how Ali s legacy is now being whitewashed. I was attracted to Muhammad Ali by how he used his vocation to inflict his worldview on the public, and it was unapologetic. In the same way with Nelson Mandela, there s been a sort of a whitewash of who Muhammad Ali was. He was a person who said,  You might not like my religion, but it s my religion. You might not like the color of my skin, or my opinions, but I am just as American as you are. And the powers that be can shove it, because I m the champion of the world and I m the peoples  champion.  And that s thing, as a kid, that made me think, in my vocation, I can express my opinion in a way that is unapologetic as well. Morello was spot on with his statement that Ali s legacy is being whitewashed. That s why a hate-mongerer like Donald Trump feels comfortable tweeted out platitudes to The Greatest despite the fact that Trump s presidential campaign flies in the face of everything that Ali stood for. Ali was so much against Trump s stance on banning Muslim s from entering the United States, that he wrote a public letter lambasting the idea.You can watch the segment below:"Muhammad Ali invented hip-hop."" @BillMaher and @TMorello reflect on Ali's revolutionary and unapologetic persona:https://t.co/qj1YJc1D71  Real Time (@RealTimers) June 11"," 2016Featured image from video screenshot"",News

" GOP Senator Drops Brutal Truth Bomb On His Colleagues: Trumps Comments Are Definition Of Racism","When Donald Trump began his one-man quest to smear the judge presiding over his Trump University lawsuit using appalling racial rhetoric, it was offensive but not surprising. After all, this is a man who began his campaign by labeling Mexicans  rapists  and  murderers  in his very first speech. What was surprising was the sheer level of cowardice on display from Trump s fellow Republicans. Faced with a candidate who said Muslims and Mexicans can t be his judge, conservative politicians tried to distance themselves from the comments, but not actually call it what it is: Racism.Sen. Mitch McConnell, for example, managed to avoid the term  racism  a total of three times in one interview. The sidestepping was so egregious that it prompted Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid to call McConnell out on the Senate floor as an example of  Republican spinelessness.  Likewise, many other Republicans released statements saying they found the comments  unacceptable  but never articulated why. The vagueness was surely intentional. It s going to be hard to win a general election in an increasingly diverse America when your candidate is openly spewing racism. Standing up to that sort of hate mongering would take courage   and that s something that is solely lacking in today s GOP.However, one man who seems to have little interest in the toeing the party line for an unapologetic bigot is Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) who said what his fellow Republicans were thinking but terrified to say: Donald Trump s smears on his judge are racism.

Clearly you had not. Your critics say you tend to exaggerate, you have a problem with the truth. Is this a prime example? Trump responded: No, I raised almost $6 million. Some of it didn t come through, but more money is coming through. The number is probably is going to be when we finish it probably going to be over the $6 million.

Just because the President wasn t in a position to apologize doesn t mean that he couldn t be the man we all know and have come to expect him to be.While the president s speech was eloquent, reminding us that the people of Hiroshima were just like you and I, it was a moment he shared with a man who survived the bombing that is catching the attention of the world.

Florida Senator Marco Rubio recently found himself wrestling with that question and came up with the answer  I d exchange it for nothing, just as long as I get 15 more minutes in the spotlight.  Donald Trump obliged.Having just months ago described Trump as a small dick lunatic con artist (remember how insane the Republican primary was?), Rubio knelt down and kissed the ring this week. On Twitter, he officially endorsed Trump in the most roundabout way possible:In Florida only 2 legitimate candidates on ballot in Nov. I wont vote for Clinton & I after years of asking people to vote I wont abstain.  Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) May 27, 2016Rubio s the kind of spineless politician who won t abstain from voting for Trump, a guy whose rallies he once colorfully described as  a frightening, grotesque, and disturbing development in American politics.  He s voting for that guy.The day before, Rubio said he would give Trump a more ringing endorsement if he let him speak at the Republican National Convention this summer. At one point, Rubio was poised to be the Republican nominee, now he s reduced to begging Trump to let him share the same stage.Apart from the promise of a few  Rubio endorses Trump  headlines, it s baffling to think of why Rubio decided to sell out, and so quickly. The Washington Examiner, a right-wing publication no less, blasted Rubio for his shamelessness.It s one thing to begrudgingly argue that as dangerous as he thinks a Trump presidency would be, that he thinks a Clinton presidency would be even worse. But to actually say that he would be  honored  by the chance to speak on Trump s behalf at the GOP convention, and to downplay his previously stated problems with Trump as mere  policy differences,  is to prove the Rubio skeptics right.That is, far from being an inspirational moral leader, Rubio has shown himself to be more of an opportunistic politician with his finger to the wind.The major problem: Supporting Trump is almost sure to backfire. In the aftermath of the nuclear meltdown coming in November, those closest to Trump are going to be fatally radioactive. In Chernobyl they were referred to as the  walking ghosts,  already doomed but still alive. In November, they ll just be called  Trump s supporters.  Rubio, who is retiring from the Senate at the end of his term (he hardly bothered to work there anyway), is reportedly having second thoughts. He may see throwing himself at the feet of Trump as one way to get his hat back in the ring if he decides to run again.It s a bad miscalculation. Trump may seem popular to the guy who just got absolutely smoked by him in the primary, but the American people still actively loathe Trump. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie learned that lesson the hard way. Already unpopular, a recent poll found that after he announced he would be serving as Trump s campaign jester, a whopping 49 percent of New Jersey voters said they  dislike everything about Gov. Christie.  As polling questions go, that s about the sickest burn imaginable.The internet was quick to reminder Rubio of the fate he just chose for himself.@marcorubio so you'll vote for a guy you called a con artist.

Hill, shocked by the answer, asked Thomas what he meant and that s when he saw a silver .38 caliber snub-nose revolver in the barber s hand: I was shocked, I was shocked for my life, because I m thinking that could ve been me laying on the floor dead,  Hill, the would-be customer, told NBC affiliate WCNC.  He did not point it at me, but it was clear in sight like he meant business. Thomas told police that Hill was lying and that his guns were all in a shed out back. Officers looked in the shed and found handguns that matched the description Hill gave to them   shocking.

" WATCH: Gay Cyclist Shuts Down Hate Preacher With One Epic Comeback","A street preacher in Glasgow, Ireland decided to dedicate at least part of one of his sermons to spreading fear and hatred towards LGBT people. He would have gotten away with it interrupted too, if not for the bravery of one cyclist who stopped to take a stand against the man s intolerance.The exchange was filmed by a passerby who posted the video online by a person named Emlyn Pearce. Pearce says that they found the man who stood up to the preacher and that his name is Ryan Vance and that he is a writer and designer. Though, Pearce writes that Vance shall forever more be more widely known as  Mystery-Gay-Cyclist-Hero-Man.  Pearce went on to write: I walk through Glasgow holding hands with my boyfriend all the time, and we have never experienced any homophobia. So to walk down the main shopping street and hear a man shouting that  the 99%  need to stand up to the  1%  who are gay was very sad and very scary.  Pearce continues, saying  Ryan Vance, as a gay man and a human being, I salute you: you made the world a better place. Thank you, sir   your pint awaits! Vance appears to be hesitant to adopt his new title.

Gingrich vowed his support for Donald Trump as well as his contempt for some party heavy hitters.After a shot at Mitt Romney for trusting the party voters to deliver the candidate they want, he turned his attention to the two former presidents, George W. and George H.W. Bush. Both of those historical failures have decided that they refuse to support Donald Trump, and nor will they attend the convention to initiate the Fourth Reich. Little brother Jeb has also chimed in that he ll be on the sidelines as well, as though he had a choice. Jeb was Trump s first real target. When it worked and Jeb dropped out, pundits everywhere were shocked. Then one by one they fell. All of the party elite; all of the establishment favorites.The money from the Koch brothers never appeared, because as evil as they are, they aren t stupid.

" WATCH: These Videos Will Make Trump The Most Toxic Candidate EVER","As John Kasich became the last rival to pull out of his campaign, ceding the Republican presidential nomination to Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton welcomed her opponent to the adult table and released a pair of web videos designed to define the candidate and make it so no sane voter could pull the lever for him this fall.With the release of the new material, Clinton began to answer one of the biggest questions of 2016: How hard and how strong will Democrats go after Trump, and what will the difference be between those ads and ads released by the so-called #NeverTrump groups on the right?Unlike many of the conservative ads, who claimed Trump was a fake member of their movement, the Clinton videos just attack Trump for his unpopular conservative ideas while also pointing out his historic unpopularity.In addition to a biting video highlighting conservatives attacking Trump, the web videos showed that Clinton is going nuclear, making Trump s right wing positions toxic in the general election.The first video takes Trump at his word, and shows a montage of the reality TV star making promises on the campaign trail. These include unpopular ideas like getting rid of gun free zones at schools, defunding Planned Parenthood, building his silly wall at the U.S.   Mexico border, banning Muslim travel, and pushing waterboarding."Everything I say"," I'm going to do"," folks.""

His divisive rhetoric is toxic, and any Republican who values their career, and any conservative voter who values human decency, would be wise to distance themselves as far away as possible from the real estate mogul/reality television star.The ones who have backed Trump have likely done so as a gamble that Trump will win and they can ride his coattails into his administration. What they don t seem to realize is, they re going to go down in history as backing the guy who called Mexican s  rapists,  told Muslims they shouldn t be allowed to enter the country, and calls women every name in the book.Trump cannot be allowed to step foot into the Oval Office, and many Republicans agree, as pointed out in this brilliant video put out by the Clinton campaign.

" When A Journalist Covers Trump, They Get Death Threats From White Supremacists Like This (TWEETS)","Journalist Julia Ioffe did a profile of Donald Trump s wife, Melania, for GQ magazine. The story was not an attack, but rather did what so much journalism does in an election year   fill in the picture of the contenders and their families.But unlike past years, candidate Donald Trump has cultivated an extremely anti-Semitic group of supporters, who have taken pages right out of the Nazi playbook in order to attack those they see as the enemy. Unluckily for Ioffe, her story got on their radar, and they aimed a torrent of abuse in her direction, with violent anti-Semitic rhetoric and threats.On Thursday, Ioffe answered a phone call from an anonymous caller who played a Hitler speech. She received another call from  Overnight Caskets . On Twitter, users posted photos of her face superimposed on a mug shot from Auschwitz. The Daily Stormer, a white supremacist site, attacked Ioffe in a blogpost titled:  Empress Melania Attacked by Filthy Russian Kike Julia Ioffe in GQ! It s unsettling,  she said on Thursday night.  I started the day off having a sense of humor about it but by the end of the day, after a few phone calls like this, with people playing Hitler speeches, and the imagery, and people telling me my face would look good on a lampshade, it s hard to laugh.

" Watch Out NRA: President Obama Is Coming For You","Where Congress isn t acting on gun reform, President Obama is doing whatever he can. He knows that the ever-present epidemic of gun violence in the United States isn t going to go away on its own, and it s not going to go away by adding more and more guns to the mix either. Common sense actions need to be taken, and that s exactly what the president is offering   NRA be damned.The president wrote Friday in a Facebook post: Today, I want to update you on some important progress we ve made to protect our communities from gun violence. As I said in January, these commonsense steps are not going to prevent every tragedy, but what if they prevented even one? We should be doing everything we can to save lives and spare families the pain and unimaginable loss too many Americans have endured.First, we ve jumpstarted the development of smart gun technology. Today, many gun injuries and deaths are the result of legal guns that were stolen, misused, or discharged accidentally. As long as we ve got the technology to prevent a criminal from stealing and using your smartphone, then we should be able to prevent the wrong person from pulling a trigger on a gun. So, my Administration released a plan today to expedite the development of smart gun technology, including by identifying the requirements that smart guns would have to meet in order for law enforcement to purchase and use them effectively   and keep themselves and the public safer in the process.Second, we re doing more to make sure that those who are already prohibited from obtaining a firearm can t get their hands on one. Today, we re announcing a rule to ensure that federal mental health records about individuals prohibited from buying a gun are reported to the background check system.Third, the White House will convene state and local elected officials from all 50 states in May to discuss their efforts to prevent gun violence through legislative and executive actions. The goal is to figure out what works on the ground when it comes to keeping our communities safe, and then share those practices.As long as I m your president, I will do everything in my power to make our communities safer and keep guns out of the wrong hands. That includes calling on Congress to pass the kinds of commonsense reforms supported by the vast majority of the American people.Making progress on these issues is how we honor the lives that have been lost by gun violence, and it s how we leave behind a stronger, more secure nation for our children. The initiative President Obama announced was just put on the White House blog in great detail, which can be found HERE.The president laid out his hope for smart guns back in January as well: Of course, though, the NRA is already fear-baiting their followers and getting people to be afraid of any changes that my take place..@POTUS' new #guncontrol push is "alarming cops who say they don t want to be guinea pigs."" https://t.co/Auoo6o77wu #2A  NRA (@NRA) April 28"," 2016And while the police have every right to be apprehensive"," it s important to remember that something"

However, with clinching the Republican nomination getting closer and closer, he s trying (and failing) to be more refined. Which includes using a teleprompter to read speeches that are prepared for him.During his foreign policy speech on Wednesday, it was painfully awkward to watch. You could hear him reading the speech, which did not come across naturally whatsoever. Watching his head swiftly move from side to side to give the illusion that he was speaking freely was more clumsy than a first date in the dark.Then came the moment when he was trying to be serious and speak about some foreign policy blunders, and he spoke about when some of our embassies overseas were compromised. However, his reading off the teleprompter proved this is probably the first time he has ever heard of the places of which he was speaking.For example, he read: Our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.

He also took it as the perfect time to completely start to try to throw Hillary Clinton under the bus.There s nothing a misogynist is more fearful of than a strong woman, let alone a strong woman who has actual policy proposals and far more experience for the job you re vying to have. And with Hillary Clinton nearly clinching the Democratic nomination for president, and Trump close to clinching the Republican nomination, he went directly after Clinton for being a woman. Even claiming the only reason she s doing well is because of the  woman card. He said: The only card she has is the woman s card. She s got nothing else going. And frankly, if Hillary Clinton were a man, I don t think she d get five percent of the vote. The only thing she s got going is the woman s card, and the beautiful thing is, women don t like her. Well, one woman who clearly didn t like all this talk of the  woman s card  was Mary Pat Christie, wife of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who was standing directly behind Trump. When he uttered that phrase, she very visibly rolled her eyes.Christie s reaction was likely that of every woman across the nation who doesn t hate themselves for being a woman. Trump is showing that he is absolutely terrified of Hillary Clinton, otherwise he wouldn t say such a ridiculous thing to try to sway the vote.

" Trump Tries To Imitate Hillary Clinton In Attempt To Be Funny  Fails Miserably (VIDEO)","While Donald Trump may be winning among those taking part in the Republican primaries, his method for garnering votes will probably not hold up as well in the general election if he were to be the GOP nominee. So far, he s been incredibly racist and xenophobic, not to mention sexist, juvenile and just outright rude. All things that play well with a large part of the Republican base, and Trump clearly knows this.Knowing he s getting closer and closer to securing the Republican nomination, and knowing Hillary Clinton is very close to securing the Democratic nomination, Trump has made a clear pivot to the general election in his campaign strategy. Now, instead of making fun of his GOP competitors like Cruz and Kasich, he s putting more energy into making fun of Hillary Clinton. And I say  making fun,   that is literally in the most sophomoric sense it can be taken.While in Connecticut, Trump decided he would imitate the former Secretary of State and how she conducts herself with speeches. You know, like an adult   like a person who wants to be president.After talking about how many have asked him to be  more presidential,  he tells his crowd he simply can t do such a thing, because he needs to rile up and entertain his crowds so they don t fall asleep. Then he brings out his new attack line and nickname for Clinton and asks the crowd,  have you ever seen Crooked Hillary?  then imitates her walking on stage. Then he says,  Hello. How are you? This is Crooked Hillary Clinton?  and of course his crowd ate it up, because let s be real, they d be entertained by a paper bag floating in the wind ( oooh, so pretty! ).The imitation wasn t only horrible, it was in horrible taste. Trump is a man vying for the highest office in the entire nation and whoever wins the election will be leader of the free world, and he clearly thinks being a vile, misogynistic child is the way to behave to gain people s respect.Trump doesn t deserve our respect, he deserves our condemnation, and any decent person with half a brain should agree.

" Twitter Users ANNIHILATE Donald Trump For Confusing 9/11 With A Convenience Store (VIDEO)","Twitter users have been annihilating Donald Trump after the Presidential candidate made a massive gaffe when speaking about 9/11 during a New York rally. The GOP frontrunner failed to remember the date, calling it 7-Eleven instead.Mt Trump made his awkward mistake during his speech in Buffalo, New York   where he is campaigning for the New York primaries. While attempting to work up the audience by invoking the spirit of the emergency services workers, living and dead, who fought to save lives during the attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001   Mr Trump said: I was down there, and I watch our police and our firemen down on 7-Eleven, down at the World Trade Center, right after it came down and I saw the greatest people I have ever seen in action. The audience are clearly somewhat confused. The misspeak makes it sounds as if Donald Trump was down at his local 7-Eleven store, and all hell kicked off   not that he witnessed one of the worst attacks on U.S. soil in history.https://www.facebook.com/ABC7/videos/10153504430897452/ Here are some of the finest tweets in response to the Trump gaffe:Donald Trump has spoken movingly about 7-Eleven.

" Trump Supporter Holds Armed Anti-Muslim Rally, But Nobody Shows Up (IMAGES/VIDEO)","Donald Trump s bigoted anti-Muslim rhetoric has inspired his equally hateful followers to hold all sorts of bigotry-inspired events to show just how much they hate everyone who isn t a die hard right-wing Christian. Case in point- one Jim Stachowiak who held an armed, open carry event to protest Muslims at the Georgia Capitol, which he dubbed United against Islam and Islamic immigration refugee. He encouraged attendees to come bearing as many arms as they like, and their intended activities included ripping up photos of President Obama, Hillary Clinton, Loretta Lynch, and the Prophet Mohammed. If that isn t offensive enough for you, Stachowiak also intended to rip up a Qu ran.This bigot s so-called rally was an epic fail, though. Guess how many people besides the rally s organizers showed up? ONE. Yep, you read that right. Only one person showed up to the hate rally, when originally there was going to be a supposed 200 people in attendance. The people at the Capitol took what Stachowiak was doing seriously, and rightly so, since Stachowiak is a known right-wing gun nut. According to The Daily Beast:The right-wing agitator has been calling on the government to  STOP MUSLIM IMMIGRATION  for years, loves brandishing his large firearms, and wants you to know that  JESUS CHRIST WAS NOT A PACIFIST. He also enjoys referring to himself as a well-armed, proud  crusader  and  infidel  against the forces of  Islam, and any other Satanic Death Cult that would destroy our Liberty. Capitol Police Chief Lewis G. Young warned people who would have the misfortune of having to work near this insane demonstration that rally participants would liked have a bunch of guns. His warning also said: DPS is currently monitoring the threat risk and, together with GBA, is taking precautions to make Capitol Hill a safe environment. However, it was all for naught, because there was, according the social media evidence, one lone idiot out there at the Capitol protesting Muslims by himself.

Ted Cruz, a man whose climate science expertise extends no further than his ability to hold his arm out a window to see if it s raining, tried to troll Democrats by proving climate change was wrong in a single tweet   and it backfired massively.A vehement denier of climate change who once claimed he was just like Galileo because both held unpopular opinions (*eyeroll*) and who accused the 97% of scientists who say climate change is real of being liars, Cruz caused considerable damage to America s scientific community while he was in the Senate. Now he is poised to be in the White House, where he could downright derail it.With those stakes in mind, over the weekend the Democratic Party s Twitter account took a dig at Cruz for brushing off the idea that carbon dioxide contributes to global warming.Yesterday Ted Cruz said that "carbon dioxide isn't a pollutant.""

This particular endeavor did not go well for creepy Texas Senator Ted Cruz. In fact, it was downright humiliating for him.You see, it seems that Cruz s  New York values  comment from the GOP debate when he was trying to slam Donald Trump has come back to bite him in the ass. While many people many have let the comment go, as it happened quite a few debates ago, Trump made sure that the New Yorkers at the dinner remember it clear as a bell. Trump, who spoke first, reminded the crowd, as he shamelessly used 9/11 to bolster the donors  pride in their city, as well as to slam Cruz: In our darkest moments as a city, we showed the world the very, very best in terms of bravery, heart and soul of America. These are the values we need to make America great again   to bring America together again  to heal America s wounds. To his detriment, Cruz was the last candidate to go on stage, and social media site Twitter lit up with photos and videos of the appalling lack of attention people were paying while he was speaking. There were people chatting, walking around, playing on their cell phones, and doing everything but listen to Cruz speak. Buzzfeed reporter Rosie Gray, who was at the event, tweeted: It s legitimately loud in here with people talking and eating and ignoring Cruz while he speaks. The Daily Beast s Olivia Nuzzi tweeted, It s sort of painful to watch someone speak passionately to a crowd who wouldn t even notice if he killed himself onstage,   with a picture of an attendee paying no attention to Cruz and surfing the web on his phone.

" Ted Cruz Is Against Adult Toys, But His College Roommate Knows Thats Hypocritical (TWEET)","Likely the last thing you d ever want to envision is Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz with adult toys, or doing things to himself, but hey, this is America, and hypocrites need to be called out.As Mother Jones just reminded us, Ted Cruz defended a ban on adult toys. In fact,  he helped defend a law criminalizing the sale said toys. You see, Texas, the state where the senator is from (besides Canada), has a law that outlaws these  obscene  devices. Ted Cruz found it un-American to self-stimulate yourself with such a thing, and according to The Week: Cruz s office defended the obscenity law by saying that  any alleged right associated with obscene devices  is not  deeply rooted in the Nation s history and traditions. I m sure this is what the Founders of our nation were thinking about when declaring war on England, and writing up the Constitution. Jefferson was probably all like,  oh, yes, we mustn t forget the devices used for self-pleasure. They must be strictly prohibited.  Probably not.Anyway, all of that aside, enter Craig Mazin, Ted Cruz s freshman roommate at Princeton. He just took to Twitter with likely the best burn ever to be written calling out the Texas junior senator s hypocrisy.

" Fabulous 7-Year-Old Protests Transphobia For His Trans Best Friend (IMAGE)","Children are proof that hate is taught and learned. We are not born with prejudice.

" President Obama Gets His Troll Game On By Thanking Trump And Cruz For This Hilarious Reason","President Obama is clearly in good spirits thanks to his surging approval ratings and perhaps just a dash of relief at finally getting some rest after his term ends. At a big L.A. fundraiser meant to give a boost to Democratic candidates this year, Obama couldn t help but make a few jokes at the Republican Party s nightmare primary situation. And like any good joke, it was funny because there was some truth to it.During the night, Obama acknowledged that there are a bunch of very serious reasons to be terrified of what a Trump presidency might look like. For women, minorities, those in poverty, or Muslims, four years of Trump are not an option. He noted that one voter met him recently and nervously asked: Tell me that Mr. Trump is not succeeding you! But before Americans despair, there is one silver lining. As Obama told the crowd, the one thing we can thank Trump and Ted Cruz for is making the stakes of this election absolutely clear. They aren t hiding behind innuendo any more. The GOP s hostility towards progress is on full display. Mr. Trump has actually done a service as Mr. Cruz is doing a service and that is laying bare, unvarnished some of the nonsense that we have been dealing with in Congress on a daily basis. People act as if these folks are outliers but they are not! We should thank Mr. Trump and Mr. Cruz for just being honest that this is how we re thinking these days, or not thinking these days. Obama nailed it. What Cruz and Trump are doing is fighting for the true nature of the Republican Party   right out in the open. Each competes to outdo the other s xenophobia, religious discrimination and hateful rhetoric. Even while Trump is being condemned by some in his party over his language, his closest competitor has repeatedly stated that he too will build a massive concrete wall along the southern border. Both have floated the idea of discriminating against American Muslims based solely on their religion. As the race sinks lower, it s hard to say which is the worse of the two.For that, Americans can get a clear sense of the stakes. The Republican Party is simply not an option if you care about women s rights, LGBT rights, the welfare of the poor, or religious tolerance. Neither candidate has a platform that extends to minorities or young people. Both have very high profile supporters with ties to white supremacy.Which is why, in a serious turn, Obama said it was crucial for voters to oppose whoever gets the Republican nomination.Ds tell @POTUS they will miss him & aren't excited about the 16 race "And I say"," 'I have no patience for that.""

" Am I Voting For Hillary Because Shes A Woman? Heres Your Answer (VIDEO)","When approached by countless people if I m a Hillary supporter, I will reply,  yes.  However, this is usually followed up with,  is it because she s a woman?  Which is the most absurd thing I ve ever heard. Sure, I m excited for the possibility of the first-ever female president, but in all honesty, it comes down to experience and ability to get the job done, which she has done time and time again throughout her career.Being tired of this question being posed, and having a decent size Facebook audience to deliver my message, I took to my page to lay out my answer once and for all.Here s my response: I can t tell you how many times I ve been asked,  are you voting for Hillary because she s a woman?  Well, to that I have to say,  no,  but if you re going ask, with that criteria, if I m voting for Hillary just because she s a woman, well, I m going to assume you re not voting for her just because she s a woman. And if you use the same attacks that Republicans have been using against her for decades, well, that means you re really no better than a Republican. And if you use her voting record against her, but then willfully ignore Bernie s anti-gun reform votes   well, sorry, you re a hypocrite. And if Hillary is the nominee this November and you refuse to vote for a Democrat or you refuse to vote, you might as well be voting for a Republican. As far as experience, don t even go there. She s clearly the most qualified person for the job. So no, I m not voting for Hillary because she s a woman. I m voting for her because she s the best damn person for the job. However, how revolutionary would it be to finally have the first woman president? It s pretty badass. And as I was going to keep this solely to my page it became apparent when Hillary was accused of ruining the Democratic party with her ambition, that this really needed to be seen again, because that is a ridiculously sexist remark. I mean, how dare a woman have the audacity to be ambitious enough to seek the White House. Is that ever asked of men? Is it? No, it s not.So no, I m not voting for Hillary because she s a woman, but I sure as hell am voting for a woman with ambition and the go-get-it attitude that she has displayed throughout her entire career. But let it be known, that if she s not the nominee for any reason, I will vote blue no matter who, because I m able to be an adult and realize the needs of the country are far more important than just the needs of my ideal candidate winning, and if a Republican wins, we all lose. // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ <span>(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js"," fjs);}(document"," 'script'"
" New Ad Proves Hillarys Been Fighting For Increased Wages For Over 20 Years (VIDEO)","The Democratic infighting between Bernie Sanders and his supporters and Hillary Clinton and her supporters is about as useful as a fart in a jar. We re all on the same side, fighting for the same changes, fighting to make sure everyone gets a fair shake, fighting for the American people and against Republicans who want to tear us further apart.So, when false narratives are spoken that Hillary Clinton is somehow  copying  Bernie Sanders on some of his policy platform ideas, it serves absolutely no purpose other than to divide what needs to be a united front. Tell everyone what you re for, instead of trying to be ridiculously petty and disparaging in an effort to bring someone else down.One of the latest lies about Hillary Clinton is the remark that she somehow is copying Bernie Sanders on raising the minimum wage. However, if anyone has access to the internet, they can easily find a record of her accomplishments, as well as what she s proposed and advocated for   including a minimum wage increase.Watch the video below and you will see Hillary pushing for a raise in the minimum wage back in 1995   that s over 20 years ago. She s clearly been pushing for a better standard of living for workers nationwide long before she even remotely dreamed of running for president.This election needs to be about what each candidate brings to the table; their experience, their plans, their ability to get it done. What this election should not be about, is trying to dissuade people from voting based on lies.And if we re going to really try to get real about wages, we need to think about solutions that will actually work. A flat minimum wage increase, while sounding great on paper, simple to understand, and is a great place to start, won t be as effective as tying wages to the cost of living nationwide. MIT even put out a living wage calculator to help the process along. This may mean higher than a $15/hr wage in some regions, and lower in others. The cost of doing business is different in different regions as well, and that also always needs to be taken into consideration. If businesses are shuttered because they can t afford to stay open, that doesn t help anyone. But it is true that more money in people s pockets puts more money back into the economy, and is the trickle up economy that will serve to help everyone. That s just basic economics.Solutions are there if we re willing to look for them, and we need to figure this out, but that s not going to happen through the noise of trivial political games.// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js"," fjs);}(document"," 'script'"

" It Only Takes Chris Hayes One Tweet To Completely Shatter GOPs Major Anti-Hillary Talking Point","It s become increasingly common among Republicans to desperately cling to the premise that the Democratic Party is just as screwed up as the GOP.

" Reporter Gets Bushs CIA Director To Admit Waterboarding Is Torture Using VERY Clever Trick (VIDEO)","George Bush s former CIA director, Michael Hayden, has always had a very uncomfortable position on waterboarding. At times he seems to acknowledge that the technique which, as described by human rights groups, is best summed up as  simulated drowning,  is inhumane and constitutes torture. He recently told Donald Trump (a yuge fan of waterboarding) if he wanted to reinstate the practice that he would have to  bring your own damn bucket  because the CIA  wouldn t go down that road again.  On the other hand, Hayden s tenure as Bush s CIA head meant he oversaw extensive use of the technique on terror suspects. How do you square that round peg? Stunning levels of cognitive dissonance, of course!Hayden was put on the hotseat in an interview with Al Jazeera, in which reporter Mehdi Hasan effortlessly walked through the former intelligence officer s walls of hypocrisy to get at the kernal of truth at the center: Hayden isn t stupid, and he knows that waterboarding is torture.How do you get a man who has spent the last seven years denying he did anything wrong to admit that he did? Flip the question around and ask whether other people should be using waterboarding. Hayden admits in that case it s  completely different. Hayden: I m not giving an answer!Hasan: Okay. If [Syrian] President Assad waterboards Syrian rebels, you will not call that torture?Hayden: Oh, that s completely different.Hasan: Why? So if America does it it s fine, but if Syria does it it s bad.Hayden starts getting very defensive, arguing that Syria wouldn t waterboard safely (there s an oxymoron) and that when the CIA does it, they do it the proper way, which he then describes. Hasan isn t impressed. Good point,  Hasan deadpans.  Series of near drownings, bubbles rising through open full mouth. That is not torture in your view? Hayden concludes by saying the  legal opinion at the time  was no and that America had a right to use the method because they were careful. So for those keeping score at home, the logic is: America s use of waterboarding during the Bush presidency was not torture, but any use of waterboarding by other nations or by a current or future American president is torture. Spoken like a true member of the Bush Administration:  It s never bad when we do it  was their unspoken motto.// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js"," fjs);}(document"," 'script'"
" GOP Freak Show? Watch Ted Cruz Have The Uncanny Ability To Speak Out Of His Ass (VIDEO)","While speaking in Fargo, North Dakota, Ted Cruz pandered directly to his audience by fear-baiting them with absolute malarkey. He went on and on about the Supreme Court and who the next justice needs to be to replace the recently departed Antonin Scalia.His words are absolute BS, but unfortunately you know so many eat it up out of fear and simply not knowing any better. After all, the Republican party needs its base as uniformed as possible to fill their minds with vile nonsense so they vote against their best interests.Regarding the Court, Cruz said: You know, just a few weeks ago with the passing of Justice Scalia, it underscored the stakes of this election, and it is not one, but two branches of the federal government that hang in the balance. We are one liberal Justice away from a radical five justice majority the likes of which this country s never seen. Because you know, a five Justice conservative majority hasn t at all been radical . Cruz continues: We are one justice away from the Supreme Court effectively stripping religious liberty from Americans all across this country. What? No, seriously   what? Unless someone from the government were to come into your home as a private citizen or protected place of worship and tell you not to worship how you do, religious liberty is still there. No one is stripping anything, except for the freedom to use religion to legally discriminate. If you serve the public, you abide by public laws, including equal protection under the law.Cruz didn t stop there though, he continues: We are one justice away from the Court effectively erasing the Second Amendment from the Bill of Rights. Abiding by the  well-regulated  part of the Second Amendment and holding true to its truest intent is not  erasing the Second Amendment.  However, if we re gonna get real about the necessity of the Second Amendment, which was originally written to amend Article 1 Section 8 of the Constitution so that all state-run militias will have the capability of being armed and trained when called forth by the Republic in time of need (see also: Whiskey Rebellion), perhaps we should look if the Second Amendment should either be amended or replaced to fit modern needs. That s just common sense, though, and something many would rather ignore.Cruz s pi ce de r sistance is when he says: We are one Justice away from the Supreme Court making us subject to the world court and the United Nations and international law and giving up U.S. sovereignty. What the actual f*ck? How is abiding by international law and treaties to be well-respected around the world giving up U.S. sovereignty? Does he want to rule with an iron fist? Does he want to be dominant and bully nation s we need to continue diplomatic relations with? Cruz is proving now, more than ever, that he s not ready to be Commander-in-Chief, because he literally doesn t know how to be a world leader.Cruz s talk is dangerous and it holds no place in reality.

" Watch President Obama Hilariously DESTROY Trump Over His Nuclear Ideas","President Obama spoke to reporters at the close of the fourth Nuclear Security Summit in Washington, D.C. about Republican frontrunner Donald Trump s statements regarding his advocacy for the proliferation of nuclear weapons. Trump had stated earlier in the week that more countries should have nuclear weapons, including Japan and South Korea. He also suggested that the US should get rid of 70 years of arms negotiations and agreements. Here s what President Obama had to say about Trump s comments: The person who made the statements doesn t know much about foreign policy or nuclear policy or the Korean Peninsula or the world generally. The president made his statement about Trump in a way that was serious, but at the same time with a tone that seemed to indicate that he thought Trump was an absolute moron. In reference to America s nuclear umbrella for Japan and South Korea, the president said that it is: One of the cornerstones of our presence in the Asia-Pacific. It has prevented the possibilities of a nuclear escalation and conflict. You don t mess with that. It s an investment that rests on the sacrifices that our men and women made. We don t want someone in the Oval Office who doesn t recognize how important that is. One can only imagine what the president s thoughts are on what the Republicans have to offer for a GOP nominee: There s the creepy Ted Cruz and there s crazy Trump. At this point in the game the president probably is both humored and alarmed at the choices.Watch video here:Pres. Obama suggests Trump "doesn't know much about foreign policy or nuclear policy."" https://t.co/y21HLhwl2X https://t.co/l54PRiXmHy  ABC News (@ABC) April 1"," 2016 Featured image via video screenshot."",News

" After Sex Scandal Allegations, Ted Cruz Unleashes Colossally Pathetic Hissy Fit On Facebook","In the world of politics there are going to be scandals. It s just a fact. There s no way around it. They can be true or they can be false, but they are going to happen no matter who you are. What s important, however, is how one handles the scandals, and so far Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz has shown that he can t handle much of anything thrown his way.With The National Enquirer printing a story that alleges Cruz s involved with five different women other than his wife, #CruzSexScandal quickly started to take over social media and the national conversation. Is the story true? Who knows, really. But at this point it doesn t really matter, because it s out there.Now, Cruz could simply shrug off these allegations, or even laugh at them for how ridiculous they may be, but instead he chose to throw a ginormous hissy fit on Facebook and blames the entire thing on Donald Trump. And who knows, maybe Trump is to blame. However, how Cruz is handling all of this shows how he may handle times of trouble, and let s just say, it ain t pretty.Cruz wrote on Facebook: I want to be crystal clear: these attacks are garbage. For Donald J. Trump to enlist his friends at the National Enquirer and his political henchmen to do his bidding shows you that there is no low Donald won t go.These smears are completely false, they re offensive to Heidi and me, they re offensive to our daughters, and they re offensive to everyone Donald continues to personally attack.Donald Trump s consistently disgraceful behavior is beneath the office we are seeking and we are not going to follow. // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js"," fjs);}(document"," 'script'"

He, of course, spoke of his time running for office and even joked that his first choice for president went out the window the day he dropped out. Carson was then asked by the women of the show about his endorsement of Donald Trump. Which, in all honesty, doesn t make any sense, and it was discovered last week that Trump may have illegally offered him an advisory role in exchange for an endorsement.Whoopi Goldberg didn t hold back at all and laid it all out on the table for Carson: This guy he s a racist and he s not good for the country You re Ben Carson! You re so much better than this. Carson then explained that because he  is better than this  he s capable of looking past the racism to the broader picture. Which is the biggest load of BS I ve ever heard.Carson also said that we have to get away from the ruling class, and unfortunately it had to be explained to the sleepy doctor that Trump is very much a part of the ruling class.All in all, the ladies of The View, in particular, Whoopi Goldberg, tore Trump a new one, and laid into Carson for backing him.Watch here: And as per usual, Trump proves that he cannot handle criticism, especially if it comes from women.

" WATCH: Bernie Sanders Blasts Netanyahus Treatment Of President Obama (VIDEO)","On March 22, the 2016 presidential candidates made their cases before The American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC), a powerful lobbying group that advocates for Israeli interests in the United States.Missing from the annual policy conference was presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders, the only Jewish candidate running for president. Although his grandparents immigrated to the United States from Poland, Sanders lived in Israel for a short period of time after graduating from the University of Chicago.While a scheduling conflict kept Senator Sanders from being able to attend the conference, he did offer to speak to the lobbying group via teleconference, as many others have done in the past. His offer was refused.In spite of being shut out of the conference, Sanders spoke to a crowd in Utah, giving his own foreign policy speech regarding Israel.Sanders told the crowd, I was invited along with other presidential candidates to be at the AIPAC conference in Washington, but obviously I could not make it because we are here.The issues that AIPAC is dealing with are very important issues and I wanted to give the same speech here as I would have given if we were at that conference.Let me begin by saying that I think I am probably the only candidate for president who has personal ties with Israel. I spent a number of months there when I was a young man on a kibbutz, so I know a little bit about Israel. Sanders went on to say, To my mind, as friends   long term friends with Israel   we are obligated to speak the truth as we see it. That is what real friendship demands, especially in difficult times.Our disagreements will come and go, and we must weather them constructively.But it is important among friends to be honest and truthful about differences that we may have. Senator Sanders willingness to speak honestly about the conflict in Gaza, and to openly criticize Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Natanyahu, no doubt had something to do with his absence from the AIPAC conference.During a Monday night interview with Chris Hayes, Sanders reminded the audience that Netanyahu is a  right-wing politician  a guy who kind of crashed the United States Congress to give his speech there, ignoring President Obama, and not even consulting with him, using it for political purposes back home He went on, saying, he s  a guy who has supported the growth of settlements, I think the overreaction and the destruction of Gaza has gone too-too far. Israel should not be bombing schools, or homes, or  just terrible damage there.

As the world comes together to mourn the loss, Donald Trump issued a response that makes his unfitness for the Presidency abundantly clear.As the BBC reports:Belgian Prime Minister Charles Michel told a press conference  scores  of people had been killed or injured in the attacks at the airport and Maelbeek metro station.The Belgian government has not confirmed casualty numbers. Brussels transport officials said 15 died at Maelbeek and media have reported up to 13 dead at the airport terminal.As Republican frontrunner and a potential President-in-waiting, Donald Trump would have been expected to send his thoughts to those who lost their lives, and all those grieving the sudden and tragic loss.

" Obama Infuriates GOP By Proving Cubans Are Not Scary Communists In This Comedy Skit (VIDEO)","Conservatives love to portray Cuba as an unviting hellhole, and its citizens complete monsters, so Barack Obama decided to do something about that. Preceding his historic first visit to the island nation, the President filmed a skit with Cuban TV star P nfilo Friday so the Cuban people could get to know him.In the skit, P nfilo accidentally calls the White House while attempting to call the Meteorological Institute in Casa Blanca to check the weather for a baseball game. Instead of receiving information on what Mother Nature is up to, however, he ends up on the phone with Obama. Penfilo,  unaware  of the identity of the person on the other end, asks if the President can convey a message to himself. When Obama replies,  This is President Obama,  the comic feigns an exaggerated panic before returning the (corded) phone to his ear. But Obama,  he stammers,  the REAL Obama. Yes, the real Obama,  the President replies.  Who s this?  After introductions, P nfilo tells the President he is glad for the upcoming visit  so that [Obama] can get to know the country and its people. The President replies with an important message to which anti-Cuban conservatives should pay attention: The Cuban People and the American people are friends. P nfilo jokes with the President about long waits at the airport and offers to pick him and the First Lady up. He even offers to allow them to stay at his house.P nfilo is a fictional character played by Luis Silva. The show is incredibly popular, reaching about 2/3 of the country s population. The Obamas will leave for Cuba on Sunday and will stop in Argentina afterward. Obama s visit will be the first to Cuba by an American President in 88 years, and an effort to solidify or new friendship with our island neighbor to the South.While our friends on the Right still hate Cuba, the response on the Cuban Embassy s Facebook page was overwhelmingly positive   a sign that, at least on their end, friendship between our two nations is at least possible.

" Scientists Measure Trumps Grammar, Find Hes At The Level Of This Infamously Dense Former President","It s been several months, and hundreds of hours of rallies, since the last time scientists took a hard look at Donald Trump s intelligence, and the new data did not help the Republican front runner look any smarter.In a new analysis of the language Trump uses, scientists discovered that he is talking to his supporters at a 5th grade level   the lowest of any candidate in the race.The study, done by the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University, seems to confirm what an earlier, albeit less scientific, analysis by the Boston Globe found: Donald Trump has either the language development of an 11-year-old child, or he thinks his supporters do.The results can often times be laughably bad. Here, for example, is an answer Trump gave to Jimmy Kimmel when asked to defend his call to ban Muslims from the United States. He falls into a Rubio-esque repeat of the same two or three meaningless sentences: Look, we have people coming into our country that are looking to do tremendous harm. You look at the two   look at Paris. Look what happened in Paris. I mean, these people, they did not come from Sweden, okay? Look at what happened in Paris.

" This 19-Year-Old From Flint DESTROYS Trump, Calls For Him To End Campaign","Everyone has had it with the Donald Trump campaign. One person, in particular, has decided that enough is enough   a 19-year-old named Cameron Edwards from Flint, Michigan. Edwards wrote a letter to Trump calling for him to end his campaign.In the letter, Edward writes that he did not view Trump s campaign as a joke like most people did. Edwards writes in the letter: Mr. Trump, when you first announced your bid to be Commander and Chief of this nation, the american people immediately dismissed your campaign as a complete joke, but not me. I genuinely believed that the people should take the time to listen to your campaign, I told others that it s possible that you may have something to offer, but in reality, I was very wrong. At that point, Edwards goes on to list some of the things that Trump has become known for over the past few months in the election. This includes the endorsement that Trump received from former KKK leader, David Duke. Trump s non-stop scapegoating of Muslims, immigrants, and people of color.Those, however, are criticisms anyone can make. Edwards, on the other hand, has a very good question that Trump would hate to answer. What exactly is so great that Trump is offering? Which is exactly what every Trump supporter should be asked. Why would Trump s America be great for a young black man living in Flint? Do you not see the message that you are sending to us? Why would someone like me even be interested in your America? Can you even give me ONE real reason why I should believe that I have an actual shot as a black teenager in your America? As far as I know, you haven t done anything to reach out to OBVIOUSLY concerned communities like mine. Please remember, I am a Flint resident, and like other members of this community, we are wondering why you and other republicans alike haven t reached out to us. The U.S. is a mosaic of people. Trump s America might be great for you if you are well of financially and are white (it still probably won t be, though). For everyone else, it would be a disaster. Every WASP supporter that Trump has to have at least one person in their life that would fall into the everyone else category.Edwards ends his blistering letter to Trump calling for him to end his campaign. Edwards writes: Mr. Trump, it is obvious that you are not interested in uniting this nation, and with the growing threat of violence within your campaign, I believe as a moral adult, that you MUST end your campaign to prevent people from getting hurt any further. It is simply the right thing to do. Outside of a few grammatical errors, there is only one major problem with Edwards letter.

" Former George W. Bush Speechwriter Epically Blasts Republicans For Supporting Trump","This is a HUGE condemnation of the Republican Party.Ever since Donald Trump kicked off his campaign for the presidency, Republicans have cowered before him endorsing him one by one even after saying that they disagree with him and despise the divisive and hateful rhetoric he spews.But former George W. Bush speechwriter Michael Gerson put his writing skills to use on Thursday to pen an epic rebuke of Donald Trump and the Republicans who support him. Trump pretty much represents the negation of everything I ve argued about politics and ideology for the last 30 years,  Gerson wrote on Facebook.What he is attacking is not just  the establishment.  He is attacking a way of doing politics based on persuasion, consensus, compassion and inclusion. Those who argue that conservatism is fundamentally at odds with these values know nothing of conservatism. But Trump represents the confirmation of the worse conservative and Republican caricatures   a belief that cultural and religious minorities are threats, a belief that America should abandon its deepest values in the conduct of global affairs, a belief that the values and institutions of our government have failed, and that the times require a strong hand.Gerson continued ripping Trump for wanting to tear down what makes America great.At its best (and, God knows, it has not always been at its best) America shows a welcoming spirit, an example of how a great nation can be united by ideals instead of bloodlines, a place, as George Washington said, where  there shall be none to make him afraid.  We should love American traditions and institutions enough to repair them, not hand them over to an authoritarian wannabe, who is too ignorant to even understand the inheritance he is casting away.And then he really let Trump have it.Trump s magical policy thinking, setting goals with no serious thought of how they might be achieved; his menacing encouragement of political violence; his disdain for ethnic and religious minorities, which has unleashed and emboldened racists and anti-Semites of every sort; his penchant for conspiracy theories, including a very dangerous vaccine denialism; his promises to conduct the war on terrorism by ordering war crimes, which would set up a constitutional crisis when the US military honorably refuses; his cynical manipulation of gullible religious leaders with tactics that border on blasphemy; his casual use of lies, which he defends even when exposed.Gerson then turned his focus toward the GOP and slammed them for supporting Trump even though he represents the destruction of all the progress America had made since gaining independence from Great Britain and damned them to regret it for all of time.How does any of this return lost greatness to our nation? Sometimes I want to shake people (intellectually,not physically) who favor political  disruption  and ask: Disruption in favor of what? Look at what you are doing! Look at what you have done! The Republican Party is now firmly harnessed to the wild, uncontrollable horses of fear and exclusion. It has already sustained damage with Latino voters that may take a generation to undo. And now many Republicans will find rationalizations to support Trump. That is natural   the reality of politics in every time. Many people simply go with the winner. But this isn t a normal time. I believe that the decision to support Trump, like an embarrassing tattoo, will follow them the rest of their lives. Republicans are not merely making a choice; they are looking into the abyss.Here s the full post via Facebook.// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js"," fjs);}(document"," 'script'"
" WATCH: Powerful Video PERFECTLY Explains How And Why Trump Is Manipulating White People","One of the greatest strategies to gain and hold power over a large population is to pit groups against one another. Divide and conquer. It s a strategy that has been used since the beginning of time as the wealthy elites, knowing they are few in numbers, but large in political sway, can manipulate a populace to their liking so that they remain in power. It s a strategy still being used to this very day, and can be seen in full swing within the Donald Trump campaign.Donald Trump has been using this us vs. them strategy since the start of his campaign. He s made a group of working and middle class blue-collar folks think that the problems in this nation stem from  the other.  The people who aren t just like them. That if those people weren t around, all of their problems would disappear. It s a mind game played by the wealthy and powerful to make groups of people do their bidding for them.This strategy is especially successful when dealing with a group of people who somehow sees themselves as better than another group. And in the video you re about to watch below, author and activist Tim Wise explains this strategy perfectly. He points out that this has been a strategy used on working class whites, especially in the South for as long as one could possibly remember. The wealthy purchased black slaves, stopped hiring the poor working class white workers because they would need to get paid, and then blamed the problems of the poor working class white workers, including lack of jobs or income, on the black slaves. However, whose fault is it? Certainly not the slaves. However, this skillful manipulation to make it so black slaves would get blamed got the poor working class whites to utterly despise black people. It got them to join militias to suppress slave insurrections. It was the ultimate scam. Divide and conquer. Wise also explains that the Civil War was about states rights, sure, the rights for individuals in states to own slaves.Trump is using this same strategy blaming Mexicans and Muslims to rile up a base of poorly educated working class white folks who really just don t know any better. They ve had a rough go in life and Trump is successfully shifting blame from those on top who manipulate the system to  the other  yet again. He s giving these working class angry white people a reason to feel superior even though they are totally being manipulated. It gives them a sense of power and entitlement that is, in all honesty, a ruse.It s the ultimate in white privilege. When you can get people to believe that they are superior and deserve better and more just for being white, and if something is bad, blame the people who aren t white, or aren t Christian, or aren t heterosexual, or aren t Republican.Tim Wise, even recently, posted about how Donald Trump his encouraging hatred. He said in a Facebook post, regarding a story of a man who killed three people for not speaking English: This is the fault of nativist bigots like Donald Trump, encouraging hatred for anyone seen as insufficiently  American  (even someone who, as with one of these victims, was Puerto Rican and thus an American citizen   something probably neither the killer here nor Trump knows). This is the kind of America we re in store for, on a much larger level, if the Trump movement is not defeated resoundingly Quite honestly, you can watch this video ten times in a row and still want to watch it again. Wise hits the nail on the head. Bravo. // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js"," fjs);}(document"," 'script'"
" Heres How Lying Trump Supporters Turned A Random Protester Into ISIS (TWEETS)","Donald Trump and his supporters are absolutely crazy. There is video that has surfaced from a rally from this weekend with his supporters doing a Hitler-esque salute and telling reporters to go to Auschwitz, and of course we all know about the outbreaks of racist violence. Well, the one that really takes the case is how Trump and his supporters have managed to make a great part of his ignorant base believe that a protester who rushed the stage is somehow connected the terrorist group ISIS.The protester, identified as 22-year-old college student and activist Thomas DiMassimo, is in no way tied to ISIS. However, Trump and his supporters have plowed on with this ridiculous and untrue theory. Trump was questioned about the spreading of this lie on a recent edition of Meet The Press, when the shutting down of his Chicago rally due to violence was addressed. He gave his usual crazy and uninformed answer, and said,  All I know is what s on the internet. So, we have a guy who literally is winning the race to be a presidential nominee who lies all the time and admits to believing everything he reads online. That s scary as hell, to say the least. He even tweeted out the fake video created by his lying fans:USSS did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage. He has ties to ISIS. Should be in jail! https://t.co/tkzbHg7wyD?ssr=true  Donald J.

" Donald Trump Tweets Out Direct Threat To Bernie Sanders And His Supporters (TWEET)","What s happening in the United States is not okay. What s being allowed to happen is not okay. We currently have a person running for President of the United States who is not only condoning violence, but instigating and encouraging it. Recent Donald Trump rallies have turned into something very reminiscent of Nazi Germany from the 1930s and 40s. If this doesn t terrify you, wake up. If you approve of this, you re part of the problem.In yet another move to motivate his band of merry morons who are clearly unhinged and will do his bidding at a moment s notice, Trump tweets out a direct threat to Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders as well as his supporters who attend his rallies. The real estate mogul seems to think that Sanders is lying when he says that his supporters aren t told to go to Trump events, so he took that as his cue to threaten Sanders back.Trump said: Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren t told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours! Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events. Be careful Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 13, 2016This threat isn t even thinly veiled. Telling someone to  be careful  insinuates harm may follow. He s literally giving permission and telling his version of brownshirts to go to Sanders rallies. This tweet will most certainly encourage several of his supporters to go. This is getting very scary, folks, and Trump needs to be held accountable for inciting violence.Bernie Sanders has since spoken out against Trump and his ridiculous allegations. The Sanders campaign just retweeted this to make the message clear. Bernie said while on ABC News: Well, I think anybody who understands Mr. Trump s campaign knows that he tells the truth very, very rarely, and I m afraid that on this occasion, he s lying again. First of all, he calls me a communist, obviously that s a lie. Then he says that our campaign is organizing disruptions of his rallies, that s a lie  We have millions of supporters out there, and clearly some of them were at that rally along with many many other protesters.

" Sarah Palin Crushes Ted Cruz After He Correctly Identifies Her As An Idiot (IMAGE)","This GOP civil war just keeps getting more entertaining.Sarah Palin helped create Ted Cruz by endorsing him for the Senate in 2012 and now she is destroying him four years later after he called Trump supporters such as herself  low information  voters. Basically, he called Palin stupid and she threw a hissy fit about it. You know, because the truth hurts.Anyway, America s village idiot took aim at Cruz on her Facebook page in a rant shredding the Texas Senator with the same slams that have been used against her in years past. Calling GOP frontrunner supporters  low information  disengaged voters, Ted Cruz s insinuation reeks of all the reasons America knows  the status quo has got to go ,  Palin wrote.  The arrogance of career politicians is something at which the rest of us chuckle, but Cruz s latest dig strays from humorous into downright nasty. And then really let him have it. Where s information on any Cruz success whilst in his short, half-term U.S. Senate seat, proving his resume s advantage over another career politicians s lawyerly executive inexperience that includes never having created a single private sector job, but boasting of his constitutional law teacher creds? (Remember America experimented with that resume before; how d that work out for the country?) Then she proceeded to list even more reasons why Cruz is a bad candidate, including his association with Glenn Beck, her mortal enemy. She also threw Carly Fiorina in his face by quoting her word for word on how she felt about Cruz prior to endorsing him.Info on consistency with his big endorsement this week, as Carly tells it like it is so very recently?  Ted Cruz is just like any other politician. He says one thing in Manhattan, he says another thing in Iowa. He says whatever he needs to say to get elected, and then he s going to do as he pleases.

" Mom PERFECTLY Responds To Anti-Science Idiot Telling Child Shes Being Kept Autistic (IMAGES)","A mother is outraged after her autistic daughter came home in tears because another parent told her that her mom doesn t want to cure her autism.If you are a parent with a heart and a brain, you re going to be just as pissed off as this little girl s mom.According to a Facebook post provided by A Science Enthusiast, a parent actually had the audacity to tell a little girl that her mother doesn t want to cure her of her autism, and then gave the child a brochure advertising a  natural  cure company.So, the little girl s mom took to Facebook to give the anonymous parent a deserved severe tongue-lashing. To the PARENT who today told my daughter with autism that is can be CURED- through specific diet, avoiding chemicals (IDIOT) and essential oils. FUCK YOU. My brilliant science minded, but incredibly naive child who embraces her individuality, came home extremely upset and confused as to why I m not trying to cure her. THIS BITCH gave my kid a brochure for a direct sales company that sells  natural and organic foods and spices  and told her  give it to your mom if she s interested in learning more about a cure. The mother destroyed the brochure, but The Science Enthusiast did provide an image from the company website.After reading about Wildtree, it s clear that they do not claim to be able to cure autism or any other disorders. Wildtree is simply a company that offers organic meals to people who have dietary restrictions due to medical conditions or to those who just want to eat more healthy. So it appears the parent who spouted this nonsense about a  cure  for autism either misread what the company is about or is truly just an idiot.But that doesn t make this mom any less angry about what this other parent did.

" Trumps Using This Shady, Sneaky Tactic To Throw Protesters Out Of His Rallies (VIDEO)","Donald Trump s campaign has hit a new low   as if it could get any worse. According to a Politico report released on Tuesday, the current Republican front-runner has found a new way to ensure that protesters are mistreated during his rallies   by using security officers in street clothes so they never see it coming.This new rally tactic was put into action during a Friday rally in New Orleans, where several plainclothes security officers were seen working. Eddie Deck, one of these officers, said that he was told to do intelligence work researching possible protesters as well as assist any security officers in uniform. According to the report, Black Lives Matter protesters were escorted out of the same rally by these security officers disguised in civilian s clothing.Hope Hicks, Trump s campaign spokeswoman, has not responded to Politico s request for comment.This new initiative by the campaign makes Trump s already violent rallies even more dangerous   especially for minority groups, which have been routinely targeted. Black Lives Matter and pro-immigrant groups show up at Trump s events often to oppose his offensive anti-minority stances, and are usually forcibly removed even in instances when they re being completely peaceful. In many instances, an attack on a protester has been racially motivated. There have also been times that Trump has actually encouraged violence or egged on his protesters, telling them that he will pay any legal fees or consequences that come of their attacks.// < ![CDATA[ <span class="mceItemHidden"" data-mce-bogus=""1""><span></span>(function(d"," s"," id) {  var js"

" WATCH: These Fifth Graders Know More About Being Grown Up Than All The GOP Candidates Combined","AJ+ interviewed a group of fifth graders following the most recent republican debate.What these kids had to say about the way the supposed grown-ups behaved on the debate stage says it all. You re adults, you re not children,  one girl says.  I mean  it s crazy,  she continues, before burying her head in her hands, in exasperation.Eleven-year-old Colin Baird pointed out that the candidates are setting a terrible example for kids, saying,  What if kids are seeing that on TV or something, thinking  Oh, well, they re doing it, maybe I can. As Addicting Info pointed out here, republican candidates habitually engage in behaviors no decent parent would want their child to imitate, like name-calling and bullying, not to mention arguing about whose penis is bigger.But unlike the GOP candidates, the kids in this video are clearly smart enough to know right from wrong.They were easily able to spot the bullying behavior they saw the candidates engaging in, and quick to call it out for what it is.When asked what a bully is, eleven-year-old Maura Sammis immediately answered by saying  Donald Trump. Another student responded by saying,  I think a bully is someone who is deliberately trying to hurt somebody in some way, or make them feel bad. Ten-year-old Oliver Andress might have summed it up best when he said,  They all just want to get in the White House.  He added,  They will play dirty. Another student pointed out the differences she noticed between the democratic debates and the republican debates. The democrats, they don t fight,  she said.  All they do is talk about politics. She goes to say,  I don t want to hear about stuff that s about other people. I just want to hear about politics.

" Sean Hannity Has Extremely Embarrassing Meltdown After Reporter Hurts His Feelings","There are two things anyone with familiarity with Fox News host Sean Hannity learns quickly: He is one of the most unlikable people working in television and he is really, really sensitive about it.On Wednesday, Hannity managed to exemplify both of those traits when he learned that Politico reporter Marc Caputo quoted a Marco Rubio staffer as calling Hannity a  f*cking a**hole.  Rather than take the high road or, better yet, analyze his own actions to figure out why people despise him, Hannity did what comes naturally to him: He threw a very public, very embarrassing temper tantrum.Here s what Caputo said, quoted from an anonymous Rubio staffer, that set Hannity off: "But Marco gives Donald a taste of his own medicine and Hannity gets all offended. He's a pussy and a sellout."" Boy"," they're angry 2/2  Marc Caputo (@MarcACaputo) March 2"," 2016Crass? Sure. Accurate? Definitely.

" Rich Couples INSANE Explanation For Why Theyll Vote Trump Has Entire World Facepalming","We know that Donald Trump appeals to what he calls the  poorly educated    just take a look around any of his rallies   but there is a disturbing number of  highly educated  voters who are also backing the candidate whose platform includes building an 80 ft tall cement wall and tracking Muslim Americans in a database.One such couple, who describe themselves as  affluent Americans with postgraduate degrees,  wrote a letter to the Financial Times that lays out their support for Trump. It s as baffling as it is terrifying.Noting that they are  socially liberal and fiscally mildly conservative,  the couple, identified as Jon and Elsa Sands, say they are  well aware of [Trump s] vulgarity and nous deficiency  and yet are tempted to vote for him anyway.Electing the standard-bearer of the Democratic Party seems purposeless. The neanderthal Republicans barely respected the legitimacy of Bill Clinton s or Barack Obama s election, let alone that of Hillary who would arrive tainted with scandal and the email lapses hanging over her head. We would get four years of gridlock and  hearings . The Republican tribunes, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, are backward, foolish and inexperienced. John Kasich, a moderate with extensive governmental experience and a willingness to compromise, is an also-ran.The logic, if it can be called that, is that Republicans in Congress won t let Democratic presidents do anything so you might as well go all-in on a Republican outsider like Trump. This seems to fly directly in the face of President Obama s actual accomplishments  an ever-growing list that is proof that an intelligent, driven Democratic president can easily outsmart the Party of No if he puts his or her mind to it.No matter, say the Sands, they are going with Trump.That leaves The Donald, really a moderate in wolf s garb, who would owe nothing to either party and might strike deals, for instance on tax reform. Yes, we could be like the good citizens who voted for a  tameable  Hitler in 1933 to get things back on track. But the alternatives look worse.Trump, who advocates for bringing back torture and killing the families of terrorists, is what the Sands consider a  moderate in wolf s garb.  Okay.But even if Trump turns out to be as bad as he freely admits he will be, voting for a Democrat, they say, is worse than knowingly voting for Hitler. Needless to say, this affluent white couple believe they will be safe from the programs of racial and religious of institutionalized bigotry Trump is sure to institute. Because if it doesn t affect you, then what s a little dash of war crimes and racism when Trump will stand strong on  giving you tax breaks?While the temptation is to blast this couple for their terrifying support of Trump, the scarier thing is: They aren t alone.don't laugh at the "sure"," maybe he's hitler"," but"" argument in FT.

" Viral Video Shows Trump For The Fascist He Truly Is (VIDEO)","If you re not scared to death of the prospect of Donald Trump as President of the United States, then you re either not paying attention, or you agree with him. And if you agree with him, then you agree with fascism and stand against freedom.Watching Trump speak is terrifyingly reminiscent of a fascist regime that tried to take over Europe in the 1930s and 40s. A regime that, much like Trump, was against the freedom of people to worship whatever they wish to follow, silence those who were in dissent, and control all aspects of the media.If you re a Republican and supporting Trump and claim you re a  lover of freedom and the Constitution    you re a liar. You clearly only want freedom for yourself and to oppress those who aren t just like you, and Trump s disdain for the freedom of speech, religion and press are palpable.Putting together a compilation of some of Trump s most horrifying moments from his rallies is the Facebook page Americans Against the Republican Party. Even down to the most recent attack on the press from a Trump security agent who choke slammed a photojournalist who wanted to record what was going on.As the page states: He incites, encourages, and rewards violence against protesters.He has stated he would expand libel laws, tearing down the framework of the First Amendment. In fact, he s declared a war on the First Amendment. Donald Trump doesn t believe in the freedom of religion, freedom of speech, or the freedom of the press. It really doesn t get more clear than this, Trump is clearly in support of Fascism and we need to make sure he doesn t ever get anywhere near the White House. // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js"," fjs);}(document"," 'script'"

Donald Trump Gets His A** Handed To Him By A 10-Year-Old Girl (VIDEO)






","A 10-year-old girl smacked down Donald Trump, and it was amazing.On Saturday, the Huffington Post interviewed Lexi, an adorable Hillary Clinton volunteer who had absolutely no problem shredding the Republican billionaire when asked how she feels about him.Lexi slammed Trump for having zero experience in government and compared him to her brother who thinks he knows everything. Number one, he doesn t have any experience, at all,  Lexi said.  And he sits there and thinks,  Oh I m Mr. Donald Trump, I know everything,  which is sort of like my brother. She also broke the bad news to Trump s supporters that if they think they ll get money by voting for Trump, they are sorely mistaken. He s just rich, a lot of people just vote for him because they think they ll get some money, too. But that s not it. You think you re going to get the money, but that s not the case. Lexi then took aim at Trump s xenophobia and racism and made it clear what parents who vote for Trump can expect of their children s future should he get in the White House. Oh, and she also had positive things to say about Bernie Sanders, who she sees as someone who is  building an environment for the kids. It s ridiculous because I mean, look at these people, your best friend you may not know is Muslim or Jewish. And Bernie Sanders, he s Jewish. You don t see anybody talking about that. He s just building an environment for the kids, their parents are voting for Donald Trump, but little do they know that their kids will grow up not having a good education and not having good jobs. Lexi then warned that if people fail to show up and vote on Election Day in November, it could mean a Trump victory. And she thinks his hair is  gross. If you don t vote, then Mr. Donald Trump will be president. I don t think that s his real hair, being president. His hair, look at it! Look at it! It s gross. I can t believe that s his real hair.

This was created last year, and the tweets would @reply Donald Trump, and credit him with Mussolini s dangerous words and ideas. Well, on Sunday, the chickens came home to roost on this one, because Trump finally bit the bait and retweeted the account.

Rather, we need to focus on coming together and tear down the barriers that have been holding so many citizens back for so long.Hillary went after Donald Trump s ridiculous slogan head-on, and simply told it like it is: Despite what you hear, we don t need to  make America great again.  America has never stopped being great. But, we do need to make America whole again. Instead of building walls, we need to be tearing down barriers. We need to show by everything that we do that we are in this together.

Whomever runs that account on Twitter decided to take a shot a Trump and his misspelled tweets, by tweeting out definitions and corrections to billionaire reality star turned joke of a Presidential candidate. The prompt for this seems to be one of Trump s crazy Twitter rants, the latest of which he posted Friday.Trump s tweets featured common, easy to spell words that were horrifically misspelled. Those words included  honor,   choker,  and  lightweight.

Now this is him about himself, okay    Great honer.  I think he meant to say honor. I don t know how he got that wrong because the e and the o are nowhere near each other on the keyboard. So how does this guy not in one tweet, three tweets, misspell words so badly? And I only reached two conclusions. Number one, that s how they spell those words at the Wharton School of Business, where he went. Or number two, just like Trump Tower, he must have hired a foreign worker to do his own tweets.

" Watch Bernie Sanders Slam The Hell Out Of Republican Obstruction And Birther Nonsense (VIDEO)","Bernie s combination of calling it like it is, and his tendency to get pissed off a little easily at Republicans often results in some epic smackdowns being delivered by him. One of these gems came up again during a Democratic town hall event hosted by CNN.Bernie started to talk about the unprecedented decision by Republicans to essentially cut Obama s final term short to only 3 years by blocking ANY effort at nominating a 9th SCOTUS judge following the death of Antonin Scalia. However, rather than act like it s some kind of new thing, he avoided the rhetoric and called it exactly what it is.It s just the latest link in a very long and unbroken chain of choices made by Republicans to disrespect, delegitimize, and smear the legacy of the first black President of the United States. Yes, Republicans would love to get a SCOTUS judge installed if they can delay until after the election. However, they tip their hand too easily in how they attack Obama compared to other Democrats like Bernie.Pointing out a glaring fact, Bernie mentioned that his father came from Poland yet nobody has asked where HIS birth certificate is. It s so obvious yet no Republican even realizes it. Bernie has just as much of a reason to have his citizenship questioned as President Obama, yet it never occurred to a single Republican to do it.

" It Really Doesnt Get Better Than John Olivers Absolute Destruction Of The GOP On Abortion (VIDEO)","Let s start by saying that abortion in the United States of America is a legal procedure. However, so many  small government  conservatives have absolutely no problem inserting themselves into the health and well-being of women put into situations where they and their doctors should be the only ones discussing what s best for them. Attacking this issue head-on is Last Week Tonight host, John Oliver.Oliver led into the segment saying that he wanted to talk about breast implants, saying: Some are against them, others believe they are fine in rare cases and some think you should be able to get them whenever the f  you want. Oh did I say breast implants? I meant abortion. It was then that Oliver delivered the most severe beat down of conservative restrictive policies on abortion likely ever witnessed on television. It may actually leave you not only angry, but in tears over how horrific so many of these restrictions are.According to TIME: A new Gallup poll revealed that 19% of Americans think abortion should be completely illegal, while 36% think it should be allowed in some cases and 29% think it should be allowed on demand. Despite the fact that abortion is legal in the United States, in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court s decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, there has been an increase in state regulation of abortion clinics, resulting in a decrease in clinics in some states. North Dakota, South Dakota, Mississippi and Utah now only have one clinic per state. Oliver s reaction to that is: Yes, Mississippi now has four times as many esses as it has abortion clinics. These laws are not only restrictive, they are outright dangerous. There are several cases of women and girls absolutely needed to get an abortion, and when those services are denied because some holier than thou zealots in government think that their way should be the only way, these women and girls will get hurt.

" WATCH: Nevada Caucus Chair Breaks Rules, Counts Non-Existent Voters","On February 20, Justin Linden went out to caucus for Bernie Sanders in Clark County, Nevada.As he was waiting to be counted,  he says he saw a volunteer begin passing out ballots to Hillary Clinton supporters, who already had ballots in their hands. When he tried to ask why this was being done, Linden says his questions were ignored.That s when he took out his cell phone and started recording.Over the next 28 minutes, Linden captured footage that shows how easily the caucus process can be manipulated.At the time of the count, there were 33 caucus-goers present to support Bernie Sanders. There were 21 present to support Hillary Clinton.According to caucus rules, only people who are actually present are supposed to be included in the final tally.Yet after the official count was taken, Linden was stunned to see officials adding ballots to the count, from people who were not there.Suddenly, to everyone s surprise, the count on Hillary Clinton s side began to rise.Another caucus-goer, Rhiannon Frauenfeld, confirmed that this is exactly what happened.Frauenfeld told Addicting Info:With the paper ballots of absentee people included, it was 42/31 Bernie still leading. As she went to walk away after counting the Hillary ballots she turns back around and pulls out ballots that were in her hands and counts several more. This is when we were all confused because we didn t know where these ballots came from. She had been holding everything so we didn t know if they were ballots she already counted or where she got them.It gets worse from there.As documented in Linden s video, the tally on Clinton s side continues to rise, although no-one is sure where these extra ballots keep coming from.Linden provided us with a timeline from the video, noting that all of the volunteers mentioned were wearing Hillary Clinton shirts.Here s an overview of the major events, as Linden describes them;6 minutes: Volunteer claims Hillary now has (37) ballots. Is questioned where the extra ballots came from and does not reply.7.5 minutes: Volunteer 1 claims there are even more ballots to add to the count.10.5 minutes: Volunteer 1 claims there are even more ballots to add to the count.12.25 minutes: Volunteer 1 comes back and says  with the extra added,  both camps are tied (42) to (42). The delegate count is (7) to (7). She had not collected ballots from people present at this point.13 minutes: Volunteer 1 collects the ballots of those present14 minutes: Ballots are collected from Bernie s camp, but handed back out to Hillary camp.16 minutes: Volunteer 1 hands ballots to Hillary side, claiming they are filling out second alignment. Bernie s side does not get this opportunity.17 minutes: Volunteer 1 and Volunteer 2 begin counting physical ballots.17.5 minutes: Additional ballot handed to Volunteer 2 from off camera and added to count.19 minutes: Count of (37) for Hillary, Count for Bernie (35) ***Numerous ballets now missing***As the events were unfolding, Frauenfeld placed a call to a legal observer, who confirmed to her that a person must be present in order for their vote to be counted during the caucus.Frauenfeld told Addicting Info:While I m on the phone with him I hear the woman conducting the caucus say now the numbers are at 42 to 42. As I try to approach her and tell her that she can only count people who were there and we can demand a recount, she kept telling me to go away.This encounter is also captured on Linden s video.You can watch the entire video, via Justin Linden on Facebook, below. // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js"," fjs);}(document"," 'script'"

" South Carolina Exit Poll Finds 75 Percent Of Republicans Believe This Horrific Trump Idea","In another show of just how disturbing the Republican Party s base has become, an astonishing number of primary voters marching out of the polls in South Carolina proudly said they supported Trump s idea to ban Muslims from entering the United States.According to a CBS News exit poll conducted during the South Carolina primary, a staggering 75 percent of voters said they supported Trump s proposal to ban Muslims. This is in line, but actually slightly up, from an earlier South Carolina poll that found Trump supporters overwhelming favored legalizing discrimination against Muslims.There s also 62/23 support among Trump voters for creating a national database of Muslims and 40/36 support for shutting down all the mosques in the United States, something no one else s voters back. Only 44% of Trump voters think the practice of Islam should even be legal at all in the United States, to 33% who think it should be illegal. To put all the views toward Muslims in context though, 32% of Trump voters continue to believe the policy of Japanese internment during World War II was a good one In the days after the San Bernardino terror attack, Trump demanded that America ban Muslims   even American citizens currently abroad   from entering the country. He ordered a  total and complete  shutdown on Muslims   indefinitely. Or as he put it: Until we are able to determine and understand this problem and the dangerous threat it poses, our country cannot be the victims of horrendous attacks by people that believe only in Jihad, and have no sense of reason or respect for human life. Certain political observers believed that Trump s proposal to ban Muslims   even American citizens abroad   from entering or re-entering the United States was so far beyond the pale that he would suffer in the polls because of it. Jeb Bush even risked his own campaign to call Trump out on it.Donald Trump is unhinged. His "policy"" proposals are not serious.  Jeb Bush (@JebBush) December 7"," 2015Unfortunately for common decency (and Jeb Bush)"," Trump s supporters loved the idea. His polls actually went up.

He s the very embodiment of change, the very picture of elegance, and has been, by far, one of the best leaders this nation has ever seen, as history will show.However, for most of us, we were around before Obama. We know a world without him as Commander-in-Chief. We know that while not ideal, the world will go on without him in the Oval Office. But what if you were born when he was already in office? What if you don t know a world with him as leader of the free world? That s a pretty scary concept, and one little girl is just now grasping that reality.In a video posted to Facebook, Caprina D. Harris shows her granddaughter in the midst of a meltdown after realizing President Obama will no longer be president. She writes,  He has been her President all of her life and Yes her birthday is also on AUGUST 4!!!! My poor baby!!! This little girl is clearly devastated over President Obama finishing up his second term. However, it s a feeling many of us share, but she manages to perfectly put into emotions and words.

" Loon Versus Loon: Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin Entertainingly Rip Each Other Apart","Grab your popcorn, everybody! The Tea Party civil war has kicked off with an all-out battle of stupid between Glenn Beck and Sarah Palin.Their feud has raged largely under the radar since September when Beck fired the first salvo by calling the former half-term Alaska Governor a clown for talking to Donald Trump during an anti-Iran rally. I m going to say it,  Beck announced. I don t care what Sarah Palin says any more. Sarah Palin has become a clown. I m embarrassed that I was once for Sarah Palin. Honestly, I m embarrassed  I don t know who she is any more, I don t know what she stands for. I saw a clip of her talking to Donald Trump. What the hell is that? I don t even know who she is any more. As we all know by now, Beck is a HUGE supporter of Republican presidential wannabe Ted Cruz, so of course that means anybody who doesn t support Cruz is dead to Beck. And that included Palin.And when America s village idiot actually endorsed Trump in an incoherent rant that left everybody craving a Yosemite Sam cartoon, Beck went nuclear on Facebook. Sarah Palin. Small Government, lower taxes, fewer regulations and the constitution? Not any more. Big government Sad excuse to abandon principles. Just because things don t go my way, I don t abandon God. Saul Alinsky is wrong. The ends do not justify the means. But wait! There s more!After a week in which Beck appeared with Cruz to get all teary eyed about  Murica and how Cruz will rule the land with God on his right shoulder whispering in his ear what to do, Palin fired back at her former friend on Thursday.Writing on her Facebook page about Beck s love affair with a man she once shared the Tea Party with, Palin went after Beck on several fronts and did not show any mercy whatsoever. Ted Cruz s star spokesman and campaign partner, Glenn Beck, promises he will support a socialist vs. the pro-life, pro-2nd amendment, pro-growth, pro-American GOP front runner  what s conservative about that?  Palin began in reference to Beck saying he would support Bernie Sanders before he ever supports Trump.Then she pointed out that Beck once said that John McCain would have been worse for the country than President Obama.Palina also slammed Beck for proclaiming his hatred of the American victims of the 9/11 terrorists attacks, and then attacked Beck and Cruz for greeting immigrants at the border.In conclusion, Palin wrote:Beck is known for his continuous mocking of Americans who may disagree with his puzzling antics, while crying just last night,  Why mock ME?  what s consistent about that?Beck will go ballistic after reading this post and will ramp up his unjustified attacks against Donald Trump, me, my faith, and you   for acknowledging all this I ve outlined, in his own words  what s smart about that?Here s her full post via Facebook.// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js"," fjs);}(document"," 'script'"

In fact, Trump seems to believe that these alleged lies on the part of Ted Cruz is enough to bring a lawsuit against the Texas Senator.

So she took her to Asahi Japanese Steakhouse in Lafayette, Indiana. They had expected good service and good food to make their evening special and memorable. But it only became memorable for all the wrong reasons.She explained on Facebook that she and her girlfriend attended dinner with a group and the chef came out to their table to to cook the food right there in front of them, which is pretty cool. Not cool is what the chef did next. He proceeded to ask the women at the table if they were with their boyfriend or husband, and then acted completely rude when Parker said she was with her girlfriend.That s when the chef crossed the line from professional to creepy asshole. He not only told both women that they needed a man, he inquired as to whether he could be that man as if he could turn the lesbian couple straight.But Parker describes the incident much better. I m not normally one to complain on social media, but the service I had at dinner tonight warrants a little complaining. I took my girlfriend out to Asahi for our first Valentine s Day together. Our chef came to grill our food for us and was asking everyone if the person with them was their boyfriend or husband. He got to my girlfriend and I and asked where our valentines were. We told him we were each other s valentines. We were holding hands mind you. Clearly a couple. He proceeds to say  well it is legal, but it s such a waste to not have a man.  Later he continues to insult our relationship by saying he could come home with us to  heat things up.  I am appalled that I would receive this kind of treatment. I cannot believe I paid over $50 to have my relationship insulted and sexualized. At the end of dinner, Parker wrote on the receipt  Don t tell lesbians they need a man on Valentine s Day.

" The RNC Pulled A Nasty Little Trick To Raise Money And Donald Trump Is FURIOUS","Donald Trump and the RNC have had a roller coaster ride of a relationship ever since the establishment was forced to acknowledge that Trump is, in fact, a viable candidate for the party s nomination. In the beginning, they attempted to separate the Republican National Committee from the racist rhetoric and asinine platform The Donald is running on, only to switch positions when they realized they were setting up a third party run sure to doom the GOP s chances in the general election.After some schmoozing, the unlikely allies seemed to smooth things over, with Trump signing a pledge not to run as a third party candidate and the RNC dialing down the attacks on Trump. From the committee s standpoint, they had to believe that the nightmare of Trump s campaign would have to flounder and die. After a close second in Iowa that surely would have been a win had he attended the debate just before caucus day and a landslide win in New Hampshire, Trump moves on to South Carolina still poised to be the number one contender to take on the Democratic favorite in November.Things have been ruffled between Trump and his pals at the RNC again, however, when people started noticing overwhelming applause for establishment favorite Jeb Bush at debates and little support for Trump at the national level. Could it be that the truce is off? Could it be that the rift between the establishment of the rich and powerful and the rich and powerful candidate has begun to grow again?That seems likely after the spat between them Saturday when the RNC used Trump s name to raise money for the general election war chest and he exploded over it. In an email sent out hours before the South Carolina debate, the RNC asked for donations using Trump s name. The message, asking for between $35 and $250, said: If you put your name on his list of active party supporters, he will proudly see your name next to the amount you chose to donate to the nominee s war chest. The RNC made the mistake of thinking Donald Trump could possibly care about a war chest for the eventual nominee if there s the slightest chance it won t benefit him. His narcissism wouldn t allow a simple fundraiser to move forward. He said in a statement: The RNC does not treat me well and then they use my name, without my knowledge, to raise money for themselves. This totally unauthorized notice is yet another example of deceptive Washington tricks used to take advantage of the voters and get money from the hard-working people the politicians have failed. In other words, how dare you use his name without paying for it? Trump also tweeted to his supporters not to send any cash to the RNC:"Get on Trump's List"" email from the RNC was not authorized. I am self funding my campaign! Do not pay. Email: https://t.co/6hKW7Ssxz4  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 13"," 2016Petty little billionaire is petty.

" Alex Jones POSITIVE Obama Killed Scalia, And Youll Never Believe Who He Thinks Is Next (VIDEO)","There s crazy and then there s nonsensical, conspiratorial, out of your head, paranoid with a tinfoil hat on your head, curled in the fetal position in your mom s basement crazy. The latter would be radio talk show host Alex Jones.Not only does he believe that President Obama somehow secretly had Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia killed, a man who was 79-years-old and a known smoker and we know died of natural causes, but now he believes that the president has plans for other people as well. You know, so Obama can finally unleash his true intentions for the nation. After all, he still hasn t come for anyone s guns or forced us all to be Muslim  yet.Jones declared in a morbid Facebook post,  this is the season of treason, this is the time of betrayal and we would be fools not to ask the question.  Which clearly begs the question, who is allowing Alex Jones to have any sort of internet privileges? He s more than lost his mind, he s replaced it with a new bag of nuts.However, he goes on: You just get used to this,  Scalia found, it s natural, nothing going on here, he just died naturally. And you re like,  Whoa. Red flag.  Then you realize, Obama is one vote away from being able to ban guns, open the borders and actually have the court engage in its agenda and now Scalia dies. I mean, this is hard core I wonder if Clarence Thomas will die of a heart attack next week. If this is an assassination, it signifies that they re dropping the hammer, that s the canary in the coal mine. Wait! There s more! Are they going to kill Clarence Thomas? Maybe they ll kill Ron Paul. Maybe they ll kill Donald Trump next. They all had heart attacks. How many more of these are we going to sit here and put up with? Or maybe their airplane blows up. Someone needs to tell this guy to relax. However, he adds: My gut tells me they killed him and all the intellectual evidence lays it out. The only thing his gut indicates is that he s had one too many cheeseburgers.He then goes on to insist that Republicans need to block anyone Obama nominates, because if they don t liberals are going to destroy the Constitution and start a civil war.

The party that has increasingly defined itself solely on its opposition to President Obama once again immediately declared that they would not allow him to fulfill his constitutional obligations of appointing a new Justice.Obama, no doubt tired of this obstructionism after seven long years of it, basically told them to shove it. He would be nominating a justice whether they liked it or not.However, in the coverage of this potentially era-defining new appointment, CNN managed to stick its foot so far into its mouth that it s a wonder they didn t just cut to commercial and never come back.Dana Bash was discussing the Republican opposition to a new nominee appointed by President Obama and in her rush to be  fair  to  both sides,  she wound up feeding right into the right-wing talking points that serious journalists might scoff at. When asked about President Obama s decision to go ahead with a nomination, Bash remarked:That s right. And as we were talking about last hour, that is not surprising in the least, since he clearly feels that it is his constitutional duty to do so. That he is the President of the United States. It is his job to nominate somebody.He  clearly feels  it s his constitutional duty? What? It is his constitutional duty to appoint new justices. That s put in simple terms in Constitution itself. Saying this is Obama s opinion is disingenuous. But Bash was only just warming up:He still will be technically the president of the United States for the next 11 months, which is a very, very long time. Yes, we are in an election year, but we are barely into this election year of 2016. So you have Republicans coming back, not just Mitch McConnell who you just mentioned, but the Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee saying that he believes that it is standard practice to not deal with such issues in an election year. Technically  he will be president of the United States. Technically. You might want to tell that to the people who voted for him for a full four year term.Needless to say, the internet was not pleased. CNN may have wanted to avoid offending conservatives, but they managed to offend nearly everyone else. He still will be technically the pres. of the US for another 11 months.    CNN. Technically?

" Before Scalias Body Is Even Cold, Republicans Vow To Obstruct ANY Obama Nominee","Moments after learning that long-time Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia had died in his sleep, Congressional Republicans were already vowing that they would spend the next 361 days preventing Obama from appointing a new justice   as is required in the Constitution.Sen. Ted Cruz, who bills himself as a  constitutional scholar,  boldly demanded that the country wait a year before appointing a new justice simply because he doesn t like Obama.Justice Scalia was an American hero. We owe it to him, & the Nation, for the Senate to ensure that the next President names his replacement.  Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) February 13, 2016A staffer for Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) also swore he would never allow President Obama to fulfill his job of appointing a new justice. In a series of shameless tweets, sent almost immediately after Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts confirmed his 79-year-old colleague had passed away, Conn Carroll said there was a  less than zero  chance that Republicans would let Obama pick a new nominee.What is less than zero? The chances of Obama successfully appointing a Supreme Court Justice to replace Scalia?  Conn Carroll (@conncarroll) February 13, 2016If anything this will put a full stop to all Obama judicial nominees going forward.  Conn Carroll (@conncarroll) February 13, 2016Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also endorsed the idea of preventing Obama s nominee:McConnell goes there: "this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new President.""

" Caught On Camera: Devastating Moment 2100 People Find Out Job Outsourced (VIDEO)","Some companies definitely prefer increased profit over principle and, clearly, patriotism. Yet another U.S. company, this time Carrier, decided that they would be relocating their Indianapolis, IN, plant to Monterrey, Mexico. This relocation will, in turn, put 2,100 people out of work come 2017.The company, of course, in a state-run by a supposed business friendly Republican, Gov. Mike Pence, is blaming regulations and the high cost to run business here at home. In a statement put out by HVAC Systems and Services North America president Chris Nelson: This move is intended to address the challenges we continue to face in a rapidly changing HVAC industry, with the continued migration of the HVAC industry to Mexico, including our suppliers and competitors, and ongoing cost and pricing pressures driven, in part, by new regulatory requirements, Relocating our operations to a region where we have existing infrastructure and a strong supplier base will allow us to operate more cost effectively so that we can continue to produce high-quality HVAC products that are competitively positioned while continuing to meet customer needs. Nelson, trying to have a heart, but failing miserably, also said: This decision is difficult and we recognize the impact on employees, their families and the community. We are committed to ensuring that our employees are treated respectfully and to working closely with their representatives throughout this transition. Actually having a heart, Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett (D) issued his own statement regarding the devastating blow to the local economy: A job lost in any part of our community affects us all, and I believe these are the times we must come together as one city to lift up our neighbors. That is why this afternoon I will issue and Executive Order to create a task force that will convene local, state, and federal resources and direct every tool at our disposal toward supporting these workers in the days ahead. You can actually witness and listen to Carrier tell their employees that they will soon be out of work in this video below. The gasps are audible and the anger is palpable, justifiably so. You can hear the company try to explain themselves to their employees. And unfortunately, due to the rotten discourse created by the likes of people like Donald Trump, you can hear one employee blame Mexicans. To add insult to injury, Carrier simply states: This is simply a business decision.

" Ohio Cop Suspended After Disgusting Facebook Post Celebrating Suicide Of #BlackLivesMatter Activist (IMAGE/VIDEO)","Cops are no fan of the #BlackLivesMatter movement. They don t like it because it shines a light on the systemic racism, the so-called  Blue Code of Silence,  and brutality, murder and corruption that is so prevalent in police culture. While this is understandable, considering their positions, some things are just beyond the pale. Here is one of those things.#BlackLivesMatter activist MarShawn McCarrel was a pillar of his community, but apparently he had some very deep struggles of his own. He left a post on his own Facebook wall that said that his  demons won.  He committed suicide that same day. While most people who are not complete sociopaths would be upset at anyone s suicide, one Ohio cop had the opposite reaction to McCarrel s death. In fact, this pile of excrement actually reacted joyfully with a Facebook post of his own that read,  Love the happy ending.

" Trump Campaign Cops To Black Rally Goers: Youre No Longer Welcome Here (VIDEO)","Donald Trump is a flaming racist, and he has made no secret of that. After all, he has a history of calling Mexican immigrants rapists, of calling for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States, and of telling his imbecile supporters to beat up black protesters. Well, if all of that wasn t enough to convince you of the racism of the Trump campaign and of the man himself, this ought to be.Donald Trump took his hate parade of a campaign to South Carolina   to Clemson University, to be precise. A professor at the historic South Carolina university, Chenjerai Kumanyika was at the rally with his friend, A.D. Carson. They listened, first, to (amazingly) gospel television preacher Mark Burris give a prayer/speech, which included the words: Father God, in the name of Jesus, we re truly thankful for the life of Donald J. Trump. We re thankful that you have created a man through the spirit of the Holy Spirit to give him the boldness to say what other people will not say, to do what other people will not do After that, Kumanyika and Carson stood listening to the events of the evening, when they were approached by police officers who told them they had to leave. There was no apparent reason for this, so Kumanyika asked why they were being tossed out.  I m leaving, I m not arguing with you,  he said.  I just want to know why. Once they had exited the event, one cop was kind enough to tell the men why they had been thrown out. The Trump campaign or the Trump people said that you are no longer welcome. Yes, you read that right. The campaign simply said that they were not welcome there. No explanation for that, as they were not protesting or causing a ruckus. Just standing there. The professor said of the incident: I stood peacefully observing Trump s speech. I remained quiet and calm the entire time I was there and never spoke to anyone other than A.D. Eventually, several police officers dressed in military gear grabbed my arm and told me to leave the venue immediately. Again, no protests, just observing like everyone else there. The difference? They re black. That s the only conceivable reason.Luckily, the entire exchange was caught on camera and posted to social media.

" Watch These Young Conservatives Try To Explain Why Trump Is Their Man, But Fail Miserably (VIDEO)","It s somewhat terrifying listening to how some of how our young people praise Donald Trump and how he d like to govern the country. It s also more than disconcerting when you hear them just parrot talking points that have no basis in reality. Such as,  Conservative values are ensuring that the government doesn t get too involved in people s lives.  They ve apparently never witnessed their conservative legislators trying to dictate the lives of women and the LGBT community. Maybe they mean  their lives    other people, well, that s different.You ll also hear these kids talk about the standard catch phrases like  family values,  which has been code for  hating gays  for a very long time, as well as  limited government  which is code for  limited regulations on business.  Because as aforementioned, they have no problem making sure government gets involved in the lives of those they don t agree with.These young cons even had the audacity to say: The worst Republican is better than the best Democrat. Really? Where the hell did you hear that? And most of these young conservatives would actually vote for Donald Trump if he were to become the nominee. However, not all of them have fallen for The Donald s schtick.You really need to witness the insanity for yourself.

" Marcobot Malfunction: New Data Shows Rubios Campaign In Crisis (PHOTOS)","A new poll of New Hampshire voters could show an alarming collapse for Senator Marco Rubio. The poll, conducted by a pro-John Kasich super PAC, may change the trajectory of the 2016 Republican presidential campaign.The poll, conducted by the pro-John Kasich New Day for America Super PAC, shows Rubio plummeting to fourth place in the primary here, with 10 percent of the vote. Most of the polling conducted in the immediate days before the debate showed Rubio in second place.The survey, which was based on phone calls to 500 likely voters (margin of error plus or minus 3 percent), was conducted Sunday, the day following the latest Republican debate. Rubio came under scathing attack from Chris Christie, who cast the first term Florida senator as too unready, ambitious, and superficial to occupy the Oval Office.By comparison, the most recent average of polling in New Hampshire shows Rubio pulling in 15.1 percent, in second place behind Donald Trump at 31.3 percent.While the super PAC poll may be a statistical outlier, Rubio received criticism on both the left and right for his performance in the Republican debate on Saturday night. After Governor Chris Christie pointed out that Rubio had performed the same mini-speech twice before at the event, Rubio again returned to his comfort zone.The next day, the nickname Marcobot began circulating for the senator, and video of his exchanges with Christie went viral.A pro-Democratic super PAC constructed robot costumes out of cardboard and appeared outside a Rubio event with the label  Marco Roboto.

In fact, it s been pretty much her life s work. So, when a robotic, mansplaining candidate like Republican Sen. Marco Rubio decided he would throw jabs at Clinton and her stance on abortion rights, as well as abortion rights in general, she did not hold back her opinion of the Florida Senator.On ABC s  This Week  she said: It s really quite sad to see what Senator Rubio is becoming in this campaign. Everybody understands that he is diving as far right as he possibly can. I ve been on record for many years about where I stand on abortion, how it should be safe and legal. And I ve had the same position that I ve had for a very long time. But what s really going on here is an effort by the Republicans to keep pushing as far as they can to overturn Roe v. Wade, to defund Planned Parenthood, to make accusations and attacks that are really extreme It s just so unfortunate that politicians like Senator Rubio are trying to politicize these kinds of concerns and I don t think he should be allowed to get away with that. Rubio had stated that Clinton would support abortion  even on the due date of that unborn child  during Saturday night s GOP debate.While appearing on CBS  Face the Nation  Clinton reiterated her disgust in his comments, saying: I think it s pretty pathetic. This is something that illustrates how Senator Rubio has just been going as far as he can to try to, I guess, buttress his credentials with certain parts of the Republican constituency. I ve been on record for years about where I stand on making abortions safe and legal, the exceptions that are appropriate that should be looked into. And the very difficult choices that very few women have to confront that lead to excruciating kinds of decisions. Decisions Rubio, sans uterus, will never have to face.It s disgusting that women and their reproductive rights are politicized each and every election cycle, because it s pretty much they only social issue the GOP has left to get people to the polls, especially now that marriage equality is law of the land.What a woman does with her body is her decision, and her decision alone.

Harassed and profiled because of the color of his skin, Trayvon was murdered by a man who had no business following him from a local store where he had just partaken in the nefarious business of purchasing an iced tea and some Skittles.We then had to watch as his murderer, George The Animal Zimmerman, got off scot-free, only to lead a despicable life of domestic abuse and more weapons charges. As if that weren t bad enough, we had to endure the gloating from the right-wingers, proud of their champion for murdering a teenage  thug  in cold blood because he defended himself against the man who was stalking him with a loaded gun.Friday was Trayvon s birthday. He would have been 21 years old. His life hadn t yet begun, but because he was black and wearing a hoodie, he was fair game for a lunatic. When Trayvon s birthday arrived we were reminded of the heinous crime that took his life for no reason as we saw memorials and tributes come across our newsfeeds. The right, being the insufferable a-holes that they are, couldn t help but take yet another opportunity to gloat.Ben Shapiro, big shot right-wing blogger for such  reputable  propaganda mills as Breitbart and The Daily Caller, decided to use his Twitter account to remind us of his official position in life as douchebag extraordinaire:Trayvon Martin would have turned 21 today if he hadn't taken a man's head and beaten it on the pavement before being shot.

" Sarah Palin Just Openly Admitted She Prefers Being Interviewed By Children Over The Press","At this point, pretty much everyone knows that failed vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin hates the media. She hates being called out, and she hates being asked questions she just doesn t know the answer to   which is pretty much every question. She clearly gets embarrassed, and instead of owning up to the fact that she just simply doesn t know an answer, she blames the press for depicting her as a moron. Little does she know, she does that to herself.However, people with narcissistic personality disorder seldom see the error in their own ways and will often shift blame. You can see this with Donald Trump and in his new #1 fan, Sarah Palin. They only see themselves as perfect and anyone who dares make them look otherwise is clearly just wrong.Case in point: Palin, upon leaving Iowa, met up with some lovely students at the Des Moines airport. She could have just left it there and said something nice, but instead she had to throw a jab at the press calling them  media jackals.  She also openly admitted that she prefers being interviewed by these children over credentialed professional journalists.Palin wrote on Facebook (as she does): Willow and I find it nice to be stuck in Des Moines airport with great kids like this Santa Monica class that traveled to the Iowa caucus on a field trip. (Preferable to some media jackals weather-delayed in here, too. I asked a few of them to take lessons from these 6th graders.)

And in the case of Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, he knows the Republican base has a  need  for someone who claims to be  Christian.  This was apparent at the last GOP debate when Rev. Senator Marco Rubio kept bringing up Jesus Christ time and time again, when Sen. Ted Cruz seems to claim to be the chosen one, and now when Donald Trump brings out his childhood Bible to prove how  Christian  he really, truly is.You see, there is no religious test in order to be President of the United States. In fact, it would be unconstitutional if it were to be required of candidates to prove their faith or deem themselves worthy of being elected. However, Republicans aren t known for following the Constitution, as much as they like to say they do, so we end up seeing things like this pathetic display to pander to evangelical Christians who are apparently so dimwitted that they can t see straight through the farce.Evangelicals, he s selling you a line. That s what salespeople do so you buy into whatever it is they re selling.

" Sarah Palin Defends Trump Skipping Ballyhooed Media Debate With Indecipherable Word Salad","Rarely in life do you see people go so perfectly together. However, Donald Trump and Sarah Palin are made for one another. They are the peanut butter and jelly of political duos. Unfortunately for America, though, most of us are allergic to nuts.After Trump decided to throw his hissy fit and not attend the Fox News GOP debate being moderated by Megyn Kelly, because apparently he is allergic to her cooties, Palin decided to take to Facebook (as she does) and lay down her defense of the hotel magnate.She starts the post with,  Media: Here, Let Me Define For You a Genuine  Game Changer .  You tell  em, Sarah! I m sure they can t wait to read what you have to say. After all, your opinion is so relevant and paramount to all of politics, or for that matter, THE WORLD.Palin doesn t want Trump to get bullied by the  ballyhooed media debate game.

The courageous GOP frontrunner is speaking for us with his  screw it, biased media  the people deserve better  red line. Finally. Trump will now lead others with this empowerment to go around media filters and egos and everything else that s stood between people with a heart to serve and the voters. As well as: We can go elsewhere to seek truthful information that includes a candidate s voting record, their responsibility in spending other people s money and balancing budgets, their record of negotiating to win, their private sector acumen and personal accomplishments, who they re beholden to, if they ve incentivized more illegal aliens to flood our borders with gifts and freebies   making America much less secure  oh, and so much more! Yes, that s all one sentence. Oh, and what s better than starting a sentence with  Like ? Like, if politics is their profession in perpetuity, which is the antithesis of our Founders  vision. She then goes on to say that she s studied journalism. Which, I guess, technically she has. However, she apparently didn t learn much along the way.Palin finishes her post with  P.S.  that is just pure gold as she throws shade at Fox News and Megyn Kelly for not kowtowing to Trump s demands: (P.S. Is it just me, or if a debate host has made himself or herself the principal in a story they re expected to objectively cover for the edification of the public, and they even acknowledge they re the reason the frontrunner chooses not to participate, then isn t it common sense (and courtesy to the voting public) to simply, humbly allow someone else to moderate the debate? With all due respect, what a strange game at play. It s at the expense of straight-shooting candidates gunning in competition for the nation s top administrative position, and more importantly, at the expense of Americans who deserve to hear them instead of the cries from a pity-partying press with noses out of joint because someone finally took a stand for common sense and an even playing field.

" Ammon Bundy Has Suddenly Had A Change Of Heart About That Whole Dying For Freedom Thing","On Tuesday night, seven of the Bundy militants that were previously occupying the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Oregon were arrested by authorities. What started as a traffic stop devolved into a gunfight with the FBI, in which the  blue tarp man,  LaVoy Finicum, was killed. The five remaining militants with Bundy, one of whom was wounded but survived, were promptly arrested. There were two other militants that were arrested in separate incidents from the one that involved gunfire.That s when it seemed things suddenly became all too real for Ammon Bundy. He, along with his fellow rebels, was arraigned in federal court and held without bail while awaiting trial. The sudden realization of what was happening appeared to knock some sense into his head, prompting Ammon Bundy to call on the remaining militants at the refuge to surrender and leave the compound.Through attorney, Ammon Bundy is telling remaining occupiers in Burns to "Go home. Hug your families. Let us take it from here.""  Jamie Wilson (@JWilsonreporter) January 27"," 2016FBI Special Agent in Charge Greg Bretzing commented that the militants were given  ample opportunities  to leave the occupation peacefully.  Instead"," they have chosen to threaten and intimidate the America they claim to love"
" How Electable Is Bernie Sanders? A Skeptics Response To Robert Reichs New Pro-Bernie Video","The great Robert Reich posted a new whiteboard video this week in which he makes a case in support of Bernie Sanders by reacting to claims made by Bernie Sanders skeptics   Democratic voters who aren t convinced Bernie is The Guy. I hasten to underline that while I m a Bernie skeptic, I m not a Hillary Clinton supporter either, though I do intend to vote for either Bernie or Hillary in June s California primary, as well as for the Dem nominee in the general election. Obviously. I d also like to repeat that I think Reich is one of the great left-wing political thinkers of our time. Now that the obligatory qualifiers are out of the way, Reich is off base with several of his counterpoints to Bernie skeptics.Let s take a look.1)  He d never beat Trump or Cruz.  Reich s response suggests that Bernie does indeed have a polling advantage over the Republicans in the general election, more so than Clinton. Unfortunately, Politifact determined that Bernie s version of this assessment is flatly  False.  While Sanders and Clinton each lead Trump, specifically, in the general election according to an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, Sanders trails both Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, while Clinton performs slightly better. PPP, meanwhile, shows Sanders losing to Trump, Cruz and Rubio while Clinton defeats all three. Additionally, and this is crucial to understanding the general election differences between the Democratic hopefuls, voters have been following Hillary Clinton for 35 years and yet she still performs better, scandals and all, than Sanders against the GOP in most polls. Sanders, meanwhile, is a relative unknown, so it s too early to tell how he ll do after the GOP begins to relentlessly attack him.2)  Congress would reject his ideas.  Reich reminds us that if Congress remains in the hands of the Republicans, Hillary Clinton wouldn t be able to do much legislatively either. Actually, that s not necessarily true. Clinton s agenda is decidedly more moderate, so while she s sure to run up against significant GOP opposition, it ll be easier for her to shake loose centrist and center-right Republicans, as well as blue dog Democrats who would otherwise oppose Sanders  significantly more leftist ideas.Reich goes on to say that Bernie could bring about a Democratic majority in Congress   if!   his political revolution works out. That s a super-colossal  if.  First of all, no revolution this year will change any gerrymandered districts. Secondly, let s suppose Sanders rides a massive wave of support into the White House with very long coattails. He d need a roughly 70-seat Democratic majority in the Senate to pass his single-payer proposal, for example.Why 70 and not 60? Blue dog Democrats. The blue dogs successfully killed the public option in 2009 and would surely join the Republicans in filibustering Bernie s single-payer legislation, hence the extra 10 votes above and beyond the 60 required to break the filibuster. Realistically, the only thing that might be able to spark a 70-seat majority (the House is totally different story, by the way) is another major financial crisis or another groundbreaking event that d compel voters to choose Democratic candidates across the board.3)  America would never elect a socialist.  Reich makes the off-the-shelf argument that there are many popular socialist programs in the United States, therefore Americans love socialism. Wrong. American voters love socialism, yes, but they don t know they do. And this argument about public schools and roads has been used since forever without successfully nudging very many voters leftward. Trust me, I ve tried it many, many times.Socialism, as we observed when Obama was falsely accused of pushing it in 2009, is still intensely demonized as being the same as communism (it s not) and, in some cases, Republicans have erroneously conflated it with the Nazis, aka  National Socialists.  (Just because  socialism  is in the name of the party founded by Hitler doesn t mean it s really socialist. Likewise, hot dogs don t contain actual dogs.)When the Republicans launch their relentless attack on Sanders  democratic-socialist platform, it ll be another swift-boating like we observed in 2004, only it ll be more relentless. Some undecided moderate voters in swing states   the people who decide elections in the polarized modern era   might be convinced to vote Sanders, but it s a long shot. These are picky, old-fashioned voters in states like Pennsylvania and Missouri. Bottom line: Softening the American voters  negative attitudes about socialism will take much longer than nine months.4)  His single-payer proposal would require raising taxes on the middle class.  I m with Reich and Sanders on this one. It s a bogus argument, pushed by skeptics and Hillary supporters alike. According to Sanders  numbers, middle class families would pay less per year for healthcare and therefore end up saving money in spite of a modest tax hike. The trouble, however, is getting Congress to support a tax hike on the middle class. See also #2.5)  His plan for free college tuition would mean colleges would be run by government rules.  I haven t heard any Democratic skeptics saying this, but I might ve just missed them. Nevertheless, I again agree with Sanders and Reich here. There s nothing in Sanders  proposal, or Obama s two-year-college plan, for that matter, showing that colleges would have to kowtow to the federal government.6)  He s too old.  Reich believes 74 is the new 64 and, honestly, I m not concerned about Bernie s age at all. As long as his would-be vice presidential nominee is strong, it s a non-issue. However, this will be an area the Republicans will use to attack Sanders, but it won t matter all that much. John McCain s age was only modestly relevant due to his battle with skin cancer. Sanders, on the other hand, seems quite energetic and healthy.So, all told, three of Reich s counterpoints to skeptics aren t particularly strong, while one counterpoint against middle class tax hikes is directed at hardline pro-Hillary people (not mere skeptics) as well as Republicans, and the final two are counterpoints to arguments I haven t really heard coming from Bernie skeptics.All in all, it still seems like a Sanders victory and a subsequent Sanders presidency would be a long shot. Not impossible, but risky from the standpoint of overcoming significant electoral and political hurdles, as well as the current status of the (obscenely gerrymandered) Congress. Democrats ultimately have to decide whether Sanders  agenda is worth risking a possible Republican victory in November.// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js"," fjs);}(document"," 'script'"

" Man Wearing Turban Kicked Out Of Trump Rally, Then Things Get Even More Racist (VIDEO)","At this point, it seems like Donald Trump cannot hold a rally without there being a protest. Some of those protestors have a tendency to be beaten, and or forcefully removed from the event. On Sunday, during a campaign rally in Muscatine, Iowa, a man wearing a red turban was forced to leave the venue.He was with a group of people protesting the event. He was carrying a sign that said,  Stop Hate.  That s a message completely antithetical to the values of Trump and his supporters.A video shows the crowd at the event was ecstatic about the man being forced to leave. Hundreds of people can be heard cheering and shouting,  U.S.A! U.S.A.! U.S.A!  It s a pretty good symbol for where America s racism is at.

" Superhero Cop Shows Us All What A Good Police Officer Looks Like (IMAGES)","It s not often enough that we see a story about a good police officer who goes above and beyond the call of duty, which is why this story is so awesome.It s true that police officers around the country have developed a bad reputation. There are bad apples in every department who can t keep their guns holstered, and they end up killing unarmed individuals for no reason. The fallout has been swift. And rightfully so.But there are good cops out there who not only do the right thing at work, they do extraordinary things off the clock as well which should be newsworthy, too.Take Damon Cole of the Fort Worth Police Department in Texas, for example.When he isn t fighting crime as a police officer, Cole takes two weeks off every year and spends it traveling the country visiting cancer-stricken children in hospitals dressed as different superhero characters. And he does this on his own time with his own money. I dress up as different Superheroes (Superman, Batman, Iron Man, Captain America and Baymax) and I travel the country seeing children with cancer on my own time and money,  he explained on Facebook. After winter is over I will take 2 weeks off from work and I will go through 20 states in my custom 2012 Superman Dodge Charger to all the children s hospitals. If anyone on here knows of any children who are sick or have cancer, PM and I will go see them. I do NOT charge anything, I do all this on my own time and money. I will go anywhere to make a child happy. I also go to schools or any community functions to talk to kids about being a police officer then a become a Superhero for them. Back in October I took a week off from work and I drove to Illinois, Missouri, Indiana, New York City and Tennessee to see children with cancer.

Glenn Beck, while on the campaign trail in Iowa with Ted Cruz, formally endorsed the Republican candidate. However, that s not even the half of it.For most of the day, Beck was sending out these cryptic love notes regarding his feelings towards Cruz. Even going so far as to imply that Cruz is the next George Washington. Althoug, George Washington was actually born in the United States, we can t say as much for Cruz.The tweets really need to be put into letter form, so that s exactly what I ll do for you here: This election is about more than someone who understands your anger; it is about those who can stand shoulder to shoulder with you. I used to worry folks would vote party over principle. This year is worse   it s paparazzi over principle. I need more than someone to vice my anger   I need someone to have my back. The George Washington we need will not be found in the garish light of gold. Do we really want another 8 years of a president who views his role as a Benevolent Dictator? The president does not create jobs. He helps create the conditions in which WE THE PEOPLE create jobs and change lives.I have prayed for the next George Washington   I believe I have found him. The presidency is not just a man, it is principles. That s why I stand with Ted Cruz. Our children deserve hope of a better tomorrow than our yesterdays; they deserve Ted Cruz. I am officially endorsing Ted Cruz to become the first Hispanic president!Connect with truth. Connect with freedom. Connect with Cruz.No, one man makes America great. But each of us as individuals, living our own lives, believing in our own strengths. That makes the USA great. Well, actually Beck, you ve made it pretty darn clear that you believe Ted Cruz is going to be your one and only in making the nation what you want it to be. While your passion for Cruz can be admired, your facts regarding your beloved candidate aren t quite accurate. Ted Cruz is no George Washington. Not even close. However, keep believing in your heart of hearts that Cruz is the man of your campaign dreams. If it s something you can hold close, do it.

" White High-Schoolers Break The Internet With This Truly Racist Yearbook Photo (IMAGES)","A group of seniors from Desert Vista High School in Phoenix, Arizona posed for their yearbook photo this week. But instead of high fiving, or the lens snapping them mid-leap   they opted to spell out a racial slur with their t-shirts. The image has since gone on to break the internet.It s fairly common for Seniors to celebrate their photo day with t-shirts that, when they assemble for a group photo, spell out a word or phrase. It could be the name of the school, their social group, or so on. But as AZ Central reports, this one was different:A photo shows six smiling girls standing with their arms around each other, wearing black shirts with letters written on them in gold tape that, even with asterisks in the middle, unmistakably spell out the n-word.The photo has a small circle in the corner, indicating it was originally posted to Snapchat, where photos disappear after 24 hours.The image began appearing across Facebook shortly after: What appears to have happened, is that the girls assembled for their class photo with their lettered t-shirts. In a large group, they spelled out:  Best you ve ever seen, class of 2016 . Then, a group of six girls decided to pose in a smaller photo in which they used their letters to spell out the slur.Jill Hanks, Executive Director of Community Relations for the Tempe Union High School District, which oversees Desert Vista said: That was not a school photo, That was taken off to the side somewhere and I don t know who took it or who posted it. We found out about it when everyone else did, when it popped up on social media. They do not represent DV or the community as a whole. These are six students who made a really bad decision. They do not reflect the rest of the student body, the 3,100 other students that go here, staff that work here or anyone in our district, She emphasized the class will undergo  sensitivity training  in efforts to have them understand and empathize with issues around race and history.Once  word  began to spread, a major backlash began.

Cruz s campaign staff took to the streets to get much-needed water to those working and visiting the fraudulent  pregnancy crisis centers  that dupe women into believing they re going to receive medical advice and treatment but are instead cornered and fed anti-abortion rhetoric and religious indoctrination.Cruz s Michigan state campaign director, Wendy Lynn Day, announced in a Facebook post begging for donations that the campaign had worked with anti-abortion group Flint Right to Life to coordinate this absolutely idiotic and ridiculously ignorant plan.

" Photo Woman Posted Of Unsuspecting Target Cashier Goes Viral (IMAGES)","A Target employee in Indiana has just gone viral for showing the utmost care, patience and kindness to a customer who was struggling to pay for her items.Ishmael Gilbert was an employee at the Glendale, Indiana Target store and had only been a part of the store s team for a short time when the 19-year-old had to ring up an elderly woman. Gilbert had no idea that what happened next would make him an internet star.When it came time to pay for her items, the woman revealed she d be using coins to pay. Gilbert didn t hesitate to help the woman add up her change and remained patient, even as some customers huffed off to find a shorter line. Gilbert said: She was all worked up because the line was getting longer and she was moving so slow. She was shaking. Behind the elderly woman was 35-year-old Sarah Owen Bigler, who was watching Gilbert s encounter with his elderly customer. Bigler was originally annoyed that her trip to Target was now going to be longer than planned, but she decided to stay when her young daughter took an interest in what Gilbert was doing. When Bigler s daughter asked Gilbert about the change he was counting, Bigler knew the wait would be worth it. She said: Part of me, the part that had a long day at work, the part of me who had a 1 1/2 year old having a melt down in the cart, the part that had set an unnecessary timeline for Target and getting home, was frustrated with this woman and the inconvenience she had placed on me.BUT then I watched the young employee with this woman. I watched him help her count her change, ever so tenderly taking it from her shaking hands. I listened to him repeatedly saying  yes, mam  to her. When she asked if she had enough to buy a reusable bag, he told her she did and went two lines over to get one for her and then repackaged her items. Never once did this employee huff, gruff or roll his eyes. He was nothing but patient and kind.As I was watching him, I saw that Eloise was too. She was standing next to the woman, watching the employee count the change. I realized I hadn t been inconvenienced at all. That my daughter was instead witnessing kindness and patience and being taught this valuable lesson by a complete stranger; furthermore, I realized that I too needed a refresher on this lesson. Bigler was so blown away by what she witnessed that she took a photo and posted it on her Facebook page, where it quickly went viral.

However, nothing could be further from the truth, and the fact that for the second year in a row all of the Oscar-nominated actors are white. Yes, you read that right. Even with iconic films such as Selma out there, the Academy didn t see fit to nominate any actors of color.Well, this obvious bias didn t go unnoticed by powerful and successful actors of color, most notably Spike Lee. To that end, on the annual celebration of the Martin Luther King, Jr holiday, the celebrated actor took to Instagram to tell the world that he would not be attending this year s Oscars, and why. Using the hashtag #OscarssoWhite, Lee said, in part, after acknowledging and thanking Cheryl Boone Issacs, President of the Academy, for giving him an honorary Oscar this past November:But, How Is It Possible For The 2nd Consecutive Year All 20 Contenders Under The Actor Category Are White? And Let s Not Even Get Into The Other Branches. 40 White Actors In 2 Years And No Flava At All. We Can t Act?! WTF!! It s No Coincidence I m Writing This As We Celebrate The 30th Anniversary Of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr s Birthday. Dr. King Said  There Comes A Time When One Must Take A Position That Is Neither Safe, Nor Politic, Nor Popular But He Must Take It Because Conscience Tells Him It s Right .Here is the post, in full:#OscarsSoWhite  Again. I Would Like To Thank President Cheryl Boone Isaacs And The Board Of Governors Of The Academy Of Motion Pictures Arts And Sciences For Awarding Me an Honorary Oscar This Past November. I Am Most Appreciative. However My Wife, Mrs. Tonya Lewis Lee And I Will Not Be Attending The Oscar Ceremony This Coming February. We Cannot Support It And Mean No Disrespect To My Friends, Host Chris Rock and Producer Reggie Hudlin, President Isaacs And The Academy. But, How Is It Possible For The 2nd Consecutive Year All 20 Contenders Under The Actor Category Are White? And Let s Not Even Get Into The Other Branches. 40 White Actors In 2 Years And No Flava At All. We Can t Act?! WTF!! It s No Coincidence I m Writing This As We Celebrate The 30th Anniversary Of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr s Birthday. Dr. King Said  There Comes A Time When One Must Take A Position That Is Neither Safe, Nor Politic, Nor Popular But He Must Take It Because Conscience Tells Him It s Right . For Too Many Years When The Oscars Nominations Are Revealed, My Office Phone Rings Off The Hook With The Media Asking Me My Opinion About The Lack Of African-Americans And This Year Was No Different. For Once, (Maybe) I Would Like The Media To Ask All The White Nominees And Studio Heads How They Feel About Another All White Ballot. If Someone Has Addressed This And I Missed It Then I Stand Mistaken. As I See It, The Academy Awards Is Not Where The  Real  Battle Is. It s In The Executive Office Of The Hollywood Studios And TV And Cable Networks. This Is Where The Gate Keepers Decide What Gets Made And What Gets Jettisoned To  Turnaround  Or Scrap Heap. This Is What s Important. The Gate Keepers. Those With  The Green Light  Vote. As The Great Actor Leslie Odom Jr. Sings And Dances In The Game Changing Broadway Musical HAMILTON,  I WANNA BE IN THE ROOM WHERE IT HAPPENS . People, The Truth Is We Ain t In Those Rooms And Until Minorities Are, The Oscar Nominees Will Remain Lilly White. (Cont d)A photo posted by Spike Lee (@officialspikelee) on Jan 18, 2016 at 5:03am PSTSpike Lee is right, and he isn t the only actor who is upset about these gross and racially motivated injustices when it comes to recognition for achievements. Lee is just the latest person of color who also happens to be a member of the Hollywood elite to criticize the all-white Oscar ballots. Jada Pinkett Smith has made similar comments. She said of the entire situation: The Academy has the right to acknowledge whomever they choose, to invite whomever they choose, and now I think that it s our responsibility to make the change. Maybe it is time that we pull back our resources and we put them back into our communities, into our programs, and we make programs for ourselves that acknowledge us in ways that we see fit, that are just as good as the so-called mainstream ones. Begging for acknowledgement or even asking for it diminishes dignity, diminishes power. And we are a dignified people and we are powerful, and let s not forget it. In addition, Pinkett Smith made her views on the matter known on Facebook via a powerful video, also uploaded just in time for MLK Day, just like Spike Lee s Instagram post:  // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js"," fjs);}(document"," 'script'"
" Trump Messes Up BIG TIME At Liberty University When He Majorly Flubs Bible Verse (VIDEO)","If there s one quality Republican voters are looking for in a candidate, it s being a Christian. You don t have to know much about foreign policy, or domestic issues, or for that matter, the Constitution, but if you say you re a Christian, well, that s your golden ticket into the hearts of GOP voters everywhere. Knowing this fact, for the past several months Republican frontrunner Donald Trump has been telling people far and wide about how much he s a Christian, how much he loves the Bible, and even that it s his  favorite book. Unfortunately for Trump, his blatant maneuvering to try to convince people that he s a great Christian who follows the Bible is all crumbling down. This was incredibly evident at a campaign event at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia Monday morning.In front of a large crowd of people who actually do know their Bible verses, Trump says: We re going to protect Christianity. I can say that. I don t have to be politically correct Two Corinthians, 3:17, that s the whole ballgame. He then goes on to call Liberty University  Liberty College  and it s clear that he s reading something someone prepared for him to say. Because anyone who s ever gone to church at one point or another in their lives knows that the book of the Bible Trump is referring to is Second Corinthians, not  Two Corinthians.  However, if you re reading it off a piece of paper and you re just trying to pander to your crowd, but don t really know what you re talking about, it s going to read  Two Corinthians. The verse he s referring to is  Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom,  which does indeed sound like the perfect Republican slogan to try to pander to  freedom  loving  Christians  everywhere. However, too bad Trump doesn t actually know what he s talking about.And as fellow candidate Marco Rubio s faith outreach director said, so honestly:"Two"" Corinthians    It won't matter.

" Montel Williams To Republicans Criticizing Iran Prisoner Exchange: Sit The Hell Down And Shut Up","Montel Williams took Republicans to the woodshed on Saturday for putting American lives in danger by criticizing the Iran prisoner swap.It was a gesture that Iran did not have to take. After all, it wasn t part of the nuclear deal reached with President Obama and other world leaders last summer. But Iran released four Iranian-American prisoners on Saturday, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, pastor Saeed Abedini, and former Marine Amir Hekmati, in exchange for Iranians imprisoned in the United States for sanctions-related violations.Republicans had demanded that the release of the Americans be a condition of the nuclear deal, and had President Obama listened both efforts would have been put in jeopardy. Six months after the nuclear deal was finalized, President Obama has now successfully negotiated an end to Iran s nuclear program and the release of the Americans the GOP used as pawns to sabotage the deal.But the good news didn t stop Republicans from whining anyway. Even though the released prisoners weren t even home yet, GOP presidential wannabes cried that there should not have been any swap at all. We shouldn t have to swap prisoners,  Christie said.  These folks were taken illegally in violation of international law and they should have been released without condition. Rubio claimed that the swap will embolden other nations to take Americans prisoner so that they can get something in return. Governments are taking Americans hostage because they believe they can gain concessions from this government under Barack Obama,  Rubio said.  It s an incentive for more people to do this in the future. Jeb Bush responded by saying he would have threatened Iran with war to get the prisoners freed. I would say . . .  If you do not release them, that there s going to be military action, that that s an act of provocation, an act of war,  he said.In other words, Republicans would have left these Americans in jail because they didn t get their way or they would have declared war on Iran and sent thousands of American troops to their deaths over the imprisonment of four people. That doesn t sound like responsible foreign policy. And former Marine and talk show host Montel Williams feels the same way.As reports trickled in that the four Americans were being released, Williams took to Twitter to blast Republicans who criticized the prisoner exchange before it had been completed.Beyond inappropriate for Republican candidates to criticize a deal to release hostages before they are home. Sit the hell down and shut up.  Montel Williams (@Montel_Williams) January 16, 2016 Dear Americans: Just for today, let s #StopWithTheStupid, just absorb that something monumental has happened. Leave politics till Monday.  Montel Williams (@Montel_Williams) January 16, 2016Only the tea party could manage to criticize a deal to bring hostages home before said hostages left where they were being held. #NotBright  Montel Williams (@Montel_Williams) January 17, 2016On Saturday evening, Williams continued ripping Republicans a new one on Facebook.// < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js"," fjs);}(document"," 'script'"
" NYC Cop Under Investigation After Being Busted With Instagram Account Full Of Violence (TWEETS)","New York City Officer Matthew Langone sure does love his Instagram account. It is also the reason he is now facing an investigation.While off duty, Langone moonlights as a producer of pro-cop merchandise. There would be nothing wrong with this, except for one little fact: the merchandise blatantly advocates for police violence against members of the community. In fact, at least one t-shirt is the very definition of fascism.The latest shirt from the Langone collection boasts zip tie wrist cuffs shaped like a heart, with the slogan,  I [heart] protesters.  The  OT  in protesters is in blue, clearly promoting the widely popular police narrative that they rake in the bucks from all the overtime they get policing the ever-increasing number of protests.

" WATCH: The Damning Video That Will Utterly Destroy Donald Trump (VIDEO)","For months now, Donald Trump has been leading the polls for the republican party s presidential nomination. His devoted followers hang on his every word, while he promises to do impossible things, like build a wall across the Mexican border and ban Muslims from entering the United States.Is Trump taking these voters for a ride?This twelve-minute video compilation, published by the non-profit foundation One World Voice, gives an interesting overview of Trump s many changing faces and contradictory political positions.The video includes clips of Trump praising Bill and Hillary Clinton, stating his pro-choice beliefs, supporting partial birth abortion, praising the Chinese, even giving democrats credit for creating a better economy than republicans have ever been able to create.After more than twelve minutes of video evidence that seems to contradict many of Donald Trump s recent statements on the campaign trail, the video s creators ask: Still think Trump is a true conservative?

This normally would be no big deal. It happens all across the nation more times than can be counted every day. However, in this case, the kids and the person talking to them were people of color. That really does change everything.The man approached the kids and pleaded with them to get off the streets and take their toy guns indoors to play with them. He was so concerned that he even offered them money to do it. The reason he was so worried is because he was afraid that the police would come by and shoot them.

It s a bold-faced grab,  BHA member Mark Heckert says angrily.  This is an illegal occupation by force. I don t care what face they put on it, that s exactly what it is. A declaration on the organization s Facebook page reads: BHA refuses to allow those who want to steal your public lands get away with this. According to the organization s website, BHA s membership rolls include hunters, fisherman, hikers, backpackers and other outdoor enthusiasts from all across the U.S. and Canada.Earlier this month, Addicting Info reported on an open letter from the badass birders who also declared war on the Bundy terrorists.BHA members share the sentiments of the birding community, with one major difference. Many of these men and women also have guns.As the group s  About  page on Facebook notes:  Some of us hunt with center-fire rifles and shotguns, others with muzzle-loaders or archery gear Unlike the Oregon terrorists, BHA members have not threatened to use their weapons to take back THEIR land from the YallQaeda terrorists. But they have made it abundantly clear that will not allow THEIR land to be stolen by these right wing extremists.During a press conference held by Ammon Bundy shortly after the group of armed anti-government nuts seized control of the Wildlife Refuge, Bundy said his goals are to  open the land up to ATV riders and pick-up truck drivers,  all in the name of right wingers freedom to destroy whatever the goddamn well feel like destroying.In stark contrast to Bundy s repulsive mission, BHA members are conservationists, who have pledged to protect public land and care for it, so that it can be enjoyed by generations to come. Among the group s stated goals is to protect wild spaces like Mulheur from excessive off-road vehicle use, which damages the land and threatens wildlife species.Members of the group take the following pledge:As a North American hunter and angler,As you can see from the video below, these guys don t take that pledge lightly.// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js"," fjs);}(document"," 'script'"
" Westboro Baptists Protest Of David Bowies Funeral Has Been Perfectly Trolled By Love","It really doesn t get more pathetic than the folks over at Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas. Their pitiful hatred of anything that doesn t line up with their narrow-minded, myopic view of their own personal brand of  Christianity  is just short of pure evil. So, when they decided that they were going to protest legendary artist David Bowie s funeral, one group perfectly protested back, and in the best way possible   with love.Here are some of the tweets surrounding WBC s planned protest:Here's something to help your #MotivationMonday which all should've heeded from the first pervert (Cain) to #Bowie: pic.twitter.com/Cr8m4FBoUs  Westboro Baptist (@WBCSaysRepent) January 11, 2016We're practicing #DavidBowie s parody, hoping his family will opt for a funeral here (or better yet: NO funeral!) https://t.co/vhia1uqGQk  Westboro Baptist (@WBCSaysRepent) January 12, 2016Perfect picket place! @CNN: David Bowie memorial concert planned for Carnegie Hall https://t.co/y5xmNs2Wnd pic.twitter.com/VJwVnWA17E  Westboro Baptist (@WBCSaysRepent) January 12, 2016But enough of those ridiculous, mindless, moronic unChristian shenanigans trying to wreak unnecessary havoc on those trying to mourn.One group, Planting Peace, located next to the hateful church, is counteracting WBC s message of hate with one of love through a fundraising money for St. Jude s Hospital to benefit children with cancer.Our neighbors at the Westboro Baptist Church have announced their intention to protest the funeral of David Bowie. They have also tweeted horrible, hurtful messages to his wife Iman in her time of grief, condemning him to hell and telling her she needs to  repent . In keeping with our philosophy of addressing acts of hate and intolerance with compassion and love, we are inviting the public to show their respect and support of a man who was not only a brilliant, transcendent artist and entertainer, but a man who lived his life as a role model for individual expression and authenticity. He let the world know that being different is not only ok, it can be beautiful. Like many others, David was taken from us way too soon due to cancer. To honor David, please join Planting Peace in counteracting the WBC s message of hate through a fundraising event to benefit children living with cancer.

" Man Without Shirt Was Shivering On Train, What Happens Next Restores Faith In Humanity (VIDEO)","Sometimes in life, with all the negativity that seems to saturate our media outlets, it s important to be reminded that there are still extraordinarily kind human beings still out there. One great example of this could be found in a recently taken video on a New York City subway train.NYC in the winter can be brutal. It s even more brutal if you re homeless and don t have much of anything to your name, including the necessary items of clothing to stay warm. On one subway train a man was without a shirt and visibly shivering as he sat by himself. However, what happened next was absolutely breathtaking.Another subway passenger strips down and takes off his shirt. At this point you can see this is where the video recording of the event begins. The man walks over to the man without a shirt, and not only offers him the shirt off his back, but also helps him put it on. And he didn t stop there. He went back and got his warm stocking cap and placed it on the downtrodden man s head.This good samaritan s name is Joey Resto, and according to ABC news: [He]  was taking the downtown  A  train to his home in Brooklyn after work this past Friday when he noticed a homeless man without a shirt shivering from the cold. At the time, temperatures in the city were hovering around 45 degrees. Resto said: He looked cold, hungry like he had just gotten beat up He looked so weak and frail. I had to help him, or he would not put it on. It just came from the heart. I don t know how anyone could have walked past him and had extra clothing and not given it to him. On top of everything he did, Resto still wishes he could have done more, and maybe had something warmer to offer him.Not everyone is the type of person to do what seems so innately right. Many stand by and watch as others suffer, but then there are people like Joey Resto who did what he could, no matter how big or little, to make someone else s existence just a little bit better. Well done. // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ <span class="mceItemHidden"" data-mce-bogus=""1""><span></span>(function(d"," s"," id) {  var js"
" Ammosexual Anti-Obama Organizer Shoots Fellow Patriot In Drunken Fight Over A Gun (VIDEO/SCREENSHOTS)","The planned right-wing extremist event Paul Revere 2016 Final March to Restore America hit a snag on Monday when one of the organizers was shot dead. No, the socialist Communist Muslim atheist fascist tyrant Obama didn t have him killed, and he certainly wasn t taken out because he threatens the New World Order s agenda to use chemtrails and HAARP to kill Christians  Charles Carter died at the hands of a fellow conservative in an argument over (shockingly) a gun.Authorities have not released details of the shooting, which occurred in Grayson County, Texas, but the Paul Revere event page announced Carter s death in an emotional plea to God to give the poster  understanding  of the incident.Apparently, God responded, as the event page s current administrator, an organizer of the failure that was the 2 Million bikers 2 DC rally, Bill Williamson, had many more details later in the day.  I am behooved as to what has happened with Charles Carter and Vincent Smith from the Paul Revere event,  the admin complained.  The event that sky rocketed in a week has gone to hell and a handbasket in less then 24 hours Charles is dead, shot in the fore head by Vincent Smith.  The administrator explained that Carter attacked fellow organizer Smith in a drunken argument over a gun (though Smith was allegedly sober):I was in chat with Charles Carter most of the morning and I could see in his post that shit was not right within him. Shortly after Vincent shot Charles then I was on the phone with him and he explained what happened, Vincent was attacked by Charles that was liquored up and enraged. Charles attacked Vincent, snatched his side arm from him and was going to shoot Vincent. Vincent had a spare gun on him and was SOBER and faster then Charles Carter. Vincent Smith I Pray for You Brother as I am Praying for Charles Carter. I Pray that you both find peace. The Texas Marshal has ruled this a self defense, and from talking to Vincent IN DEPTH  I Bill Williamson BELIEVE HIM!  the administrator wrote.  If I am wrong them so be it. Right-wing online radio host Keith Williams also shared his sorrow over the unnecessary example of  responsible gun ownership.  Williams says that Carter was killed by a  fellow patriot  who  was suppose to be his brother in arms and friend. One of their fellow  patriots  says Carter was  shot between the eyes. Recently, the state of Texas made it completely legal to open carry handguns. While it is a felony in the state to carry any firearm while intoxicated, conservatives have traditionally opposed any and all firearms safety laws, viewing them as some sort of plot to grab guns from  patriots  like them. Unfortunately, we can expect to see  responsible gun owners  and  good guys with guns  (as the NRA calls every (white) person carrying a weapon until, of course, they commit a crime) shooting their friends family members, and enemies alike until we reform our firearms laws.Watch a video of Carter ironically begging conservatives to stop fighting with each other below:(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js"," fjs);}(document"," 'script'"

" Ellen DeGeneres Tells Hillary Clinton To Her Face Who She Wants As President (VIDEO)","With the primaries getting closer and the choice for Democratic nominee for president becoming a choice between Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders and Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, more and more people are letting their opinions be known when it comes to who they want to lead the nation.And while Sanders is definitely getting his fair share of endorsements, Clinton has been receiving quite a few lately. Between Planned Parenthood and former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords giving her the nod back to back, now another person has told Hillary to her face that she has every aspect that they d like to see in a president.While appearing on the The Ellen Show, Clinton sat down with host Ellen DeGeneres, who then let her feelings be known directly to the candidate: I mean, I ve said it before, that you ve been held to a completely different standard than everyone else seems to be, you know, held to. You know what a supporter I am. I think that you re as smart as can be, I think you are qualified, I think you stand for everything that I want in a president. And while this isn t a direct endorsement, this should really come as no surprise. Last October, while interviewing Pharrell, the producer/singer let DeGeneres know that he would be supporting Hillary, and she responded with: We have become a society where it is all about personality and celebrity and charm, instead of it being about the person who s gonna get the job done. And while we still don t know who is going to win the Democratic primary, let alone who will win the White House, Hillary definitely has the experience, know how, and wherewithal to get the job. She s seen and dealt with it all throughout her tenure in Washington DC. That being said, Bernie Sanders would still make a very formidable candidate, and honestly either candidate would be heads above any Republican candidate.Here s DeGeneres speaking with Clinton: // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js"," fjs);}(document"," 'script'"

" Cher Does NOT Hold Back On Twitter As She Calls For Death Of Michigan Governor (TWEETS)","When it comes to the safety of our drinking water that comes out of our taps, we are left to trust those who are elected to keep us safe and work in our best interests. However, what s been happening in Flint, Michigan over the past few years is criminal. Flint s city manager was held accountable to Gov. Rick Snyder (R) alone. They, alongside other officials denied that there was lead contamination in the Flint s water.As Rachel Maddow reported: For more than 18 months, state and local government officials ignored irrefutable evidence that the water pumped from the Flint River exposed [residents] to extreme toxicity,  the complaint reads.  The deliberately false denials about the safety of the Flint River water was as deadly as it was arrogant. Calling officials  conduct  so egregious and so outrageous that it shocks the conscience,  the complaint cites the specific experiences of a few plaintiffs and their families, all of whom allege they have been challenged by similar health ailments since high levels of lead and copper entered their bloodstreams.These conditions include skin lesions, hair loss, chemical-induced hypertension, vision loss and depression. Of the four families described in the complaint, two had ceased to drink Flint water after a certain point   and used it only for washing and cooking   but still said they were exposed to many of the same ill effects. Finally admitting to the toxicity in Flint, Snyder declared a state of emergency and apologized, but for many it is too late. The U.S. Justice Department has now opened an investigation into how things could have gone so devastatingly wrong for so long. This is following an EPA investigation that began last November.Needless to say, people are utterly outraged, and justifiably so.Taking to Twitter, legendary artist Cher called Snyder out by name and asked that he be jailed. Then going a step further, called for the death penalty. She said: Gov. of Michigan is a murderer. HE made the decision to give people poison water, and now must sign disaster bill.

" NRA Good Guy With a Gun Angry About Obamas Executive Orders Shoots Up Apartment Building (VIDEO)","Gun enthusiasts across the country have been expressing their rage over President Obama s common sense attempts to close the  gun show loophole  and make America safer by keeping firearms out of the hands of people who should not have them   like those who would start shooting up a building because they are displeased with the idea of keeping children safe from violent criminals.Ever since Obama announced his planned executive action on guns, conservatives have been preparing for  war on the President s policies. We ve been hearing from the right that President Obama is making a gun grab   that he s coming to round-up law-abiding gun owners and something, something Dark Side. And, of course, as we saw with Robert Dear and the extreme anti-Planned Parenthood rhetoric, one brave ammosexual decided to do what he viewed as his duty and offer up an armed opposition to Obama s policies.At around 6 p.m. on Tuesday, police in Redding, California responded to a report of shots fired at an apartment building. According to a statement from the Shasta County Sheriff s Department, what law enforcement found was sort of expected. A white man in his 50s had fired 6-8 shots into neighboring apartments because he was mad at Obama for attempting to reform gun laws. If that s not bad enough, he also had a letter from the NRA taped to his window. Once police arrived, he began shooting at them: Officers made verbal contact with the subject, described as a white adult male in his 50 s via a patrol car PA system. The suspect would open the door to the apartment briefly and yell at the officers.  Witnesses on scene later advised detectives that the suspect was upset about the recent legislation regarding gun laws issued by President Obama. The suspect was not compliant with officers who directed the suspect to exit his apartment with his hands up. During this time, officers attempted to subdue the suspect by utilizing less lethal bean bag rounds which had no effect on the suspect s compliance.  An attempt to utilize a police K-9 to subdue the suspect was also unsuccessful. After further commands by officers for the suspect to surrender, the suspect exited the apartment holding a handgun in his right hand, leveling it at officers who were tactically positioned outside his apartment, in the parking lot near parked vehicles and nearby trees,  the release notes.  Nine officers engaged the suspect with handguns and rifles subsequently striking the suspect multiple times.  The suspect was declared deceased on scene. We heard the five shots   everyone was screaming,  resident David Rice recalled.  He came out screaming  Obama! Obama! Obama!  (Police) told him to come out with (his) hands up, and he kept telling them  No, no, no. One woman recounted being briefly taken hostage by the anti-Obama shooter, who grabbed her and pulled her into his apartment: As soon as he shut the door, he hugged me and he kissed me on the forehead. He was aiming at a guy, and then he just got sloppy   he was shooting everywhere. The shooter, whose name has not been released, had a documented history of mental issues and was a felon, but was somehow able to get a gun   in other words, he was exactly the sort of person the President s plan aims to keep from being weapons.Fortunately, no one was hurt (aside from the shooter) this time.Watch a video of the shooter below:(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js"," fjs);}(document"," 'script'"

In fact, people are getting really good at mocking them.As the FBI announced that it would be cutting off power to the building and supplies have already begun to run low (who knew you needed more than a few boxes of Ramen noodles to sustain you on an months-long occupation of a federal building?), things are looking pretty desperate for the anti-government fanatics hold up within.

" Micheal Moore Demands MI Republican Gov. Be Arrested For Poisoning Flints Water (IMAGE)","Michael Moore has joined others in calling for U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch to investigate Michigan s Republican Governor Rick Snyder for not preventing lead from contaminating the city of Flint s water system. Moore was born and raised in Flint, MI. His first documentary film, Roger & Me, chronicles the downfall of Flint and explains how its demise was orchestrated by big business and conservative policy.Moore posted a photo of himself on social media that shows him holding a pair of handcuffs. In his other hand, Moore is holding up a sign which reads, #ArrestGovSnyder. Activists have been using the hash tag to call attention to Flint s water crisis, and Snyder s culpability in the matter.https://www.facebook.com/mmflint/photos/a.10150288227701857.331023.24674986856/10153223367636857/?type=3&theaterAccompanying the photo, is a letter written by Moore condemning Snyder over the crisis. Moore Writes: Dear Governor Snyder:Thanks to you, sir, and the premeditated actions of your administrators, you have effectively poisoned, not just some, but apparently ALL of the children in my hometown of Flint, Michigan.And for that, you have to go to jail.To poison all the children in an historic American city is no small feat. Even international terrorist organizations haven t figured out yet how to do something on a magnitude like this.By taking away the city s clean drinking water in order to  cut costs,  and then switching the city s water supply to Flint River water, you have allowed massively unsafe levels of pollutants and lead into the water that travels in to everyone s home. Every Flint resident is trapped by this environmental nightmare which you, Governor, have created. Moore argues that Snyder is a criminal, and should be arrested for switching the city s water source to the Flint River, which caused the contamination. Moore argues: Like any real criminal, when you were confronted with the truth (by the EPA and other leading water experts across America), you denied what you did. Even worse, you decided to mock your accusers and their findings. As I said, I know you don t like to believe in a lot of science (after all, you used to run Gateway Computers, and that, really, is all anyone needs to know about you), but this time the science has caught up with you   and this time, I hope, it s going to convict you.

" The FIVE Most Ridiculous Things Done So Far By These Make-Believe Patriots In Oregon","Last Saturday, a bunch of well-armed  militiamen  decided to protest the extended sentence of two Oregon ranchers, Dwight and Steven Hammond, who started fires on federal land near their property. The federal law they broke has a minimum five-year sentence. And according to Rolling Stone: The first federal judge to handle the case concluded that the mandatory sentence was too stiff and gave the pair far lighter sentences, which they served. But the U.S. attorney in the case called foul; the federal government took the rare step of appealing the sentence. In October 2015, the Ninth Circuit imposed the mandatory minimum, ruling that:  given the seriousness of arson, a five-year sentence is not grossly disproportionate to the offense.  The ranchers are due back in federal prison Monday to serve out their five years each. Well, not wanting to stay out of the limelight for too long, Ammon Bundy, son of the infamous anti-government imbecile Cliven Bundy who stood his ground with no penalty against the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) not too long ago, decided he would involve himself in the fight against  tyranny  of government against these law-breaking ranchers. Bundy, and his band of merry morons, decided to take over the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Burns, Oregon. He posted a video to Facebook where he declared: We have basically taken over the Malheur Wildlife Refuge. And this will become a base place for patriots from all over the country to come and be housed here and to live here. And we re planning on staying here for several years bring your arms. Maybe they don t need their legs?Well, needless to say, the government isn t being  tyrannical,  but rather following the laws as they are written. These  militiamen  may not like the laws, but that s what elections are for   you vote in the people who make the laws. You don t hold armed protests, or rather hissy fits, in an empty wildlife refuge.Nonetheless, in no particular order, here are the five stupidest things done by these make-believe  Patriots  in Oregon:If there s a protest by ultra-right-wing morons to be had somewhere, you know there are bound to be an abundance of signs that are misspelled. And not disappointing us in the slightest, the Bundy  Militia   made sure to offer some doozies. Looks like maybe they could have used some of that  tyranical goverment  [sic] to help them get a better education.via littlegreenfootballs.comOne of the  Patriots,  Jon Ritzenheimer, even made a goodbye video for his family. Occupying a bird refuge is dangerous, and you never know when a bald eagle may come to knock some sense into them.After this pathetic request for snacks and supplies because this group of  soldiers  apparently forgot the Boy Scout motto  be prepared // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js"," fjs);}(document"," 'script'"

" Why The Hell Are Our News Media Whitewashing Domestic Terrorism In Oregon?","We all rely on the media every day to know what s going on in our world. Many media sources these days have an opinion informing the content they provide, but the majority usually try to avoid outright lying about things. That doesn t seem to be the case in what s happening right now in Oregon.There is an ongoing armed insurrectionist seizure of a federal building happening at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge HQ in Oregon. Depending on what news source you rely on for your  facts , you might be unaware of the reality of the situation.To bring you up to speed: Dwight Hammond, 73, and Steven Hammond, 46, lit fires in an attempt to protect some of their property from invasive plant species. They ended up burning federal land   twice. Their actions netted them an eventual conviction for arson, which they served time for. After they were released, their sentences from a previous judge were found to be illegal   due to them being too short for the minimum sentencing requirements   and they were sent back to jail for longer sentences. The second conviction is what set off the protests, and caused Cliven Bundy s idiot militia to take up arms. To be fair, the Hammonds never asked anybody for help, especially not the Bundys.Here is where this all takes an incredibly weird turn. Many media outlets have been picking up this story, but the major ones are pants-on-fire lying about the event.Below is an excerpt from the Fox News reporting of the situation. Remember, Fox News  article published at 12:00 midnight at the earliest:Some local residents feared the Saturday rally would involve more than speeches, flags and marching. But the only real additions to that list seemed to be songs, flowers and pennies.As marchers reached the courthouse, they tossed hundreds of pennies at the locked door. Their message: civilians were buying back their government. After the march passed, two girls swooped in to scavenge the pennies.A few blocks away, Hammond and his wife Susan greeted marchers, who planted flower bouquets in the snow. They sang some songs, Hammond said a few words, and the protesters marched back to their cars.Dwight Hammond has said he and his son plan to peacefully report to prison Jan. 4 as ordered by the judge.Source: Fox NewsBelow are excerpts from Oregon Live. This is the exact story Fox News credited at the bottom of their article for the information in their reporting. Oregon Live s story was posted with the updates on weapons and threats of violence at 9:15 pm and again at 12:00 am:In phone interviews from inside the occupied building Saturday night, Ammon Bundy and his brother, Ryan Bundy, said they are not looking to hurt anyone. But they would not rule out violence if police tried to remove them, they said. The facility has been the tool to do all the tyranny that has been placed upon the Hammonds,  Ammon Bundy said. We re planning on staying here for years, absolutely,  he added.  This is not a decision we ve made at the last minute. Neither man would say how many people are in the building or whether they are armed. Ryan Bundy said there were no hostages, but the group is demanding that the Hammonds be released and the federal government relinquish control of the Malheur National Forest.He said many would be willing to fight   and die, if necessary   to defend what they see as constitutionally protected rights for states, counties and individuals to manage local lands.Source: Oregonlive.comBelow is a video of Oregon Live s local news coverage   The people walking around in combat gear carrying long rifles seems to be too nuanced for ABC, AP or Fox News to notice:Many people have been calling out Fox for their total bullsh*t coverage on twitter:@FoxNews You misspelled "Armed Christian terrorists.""

" Cliven Bundys Sons Occupy Oregon Wildlife Reserve With Armed Militia Of U.S. Patriots (VIDEO)","Last year, Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy made national headlines for his insane standoff with government officials over the illegal grazing of his cattle, and now his three sons have followed in his footsteps by taking up arms with  about 150  armed and dangerous militia members in an Oregon wildlife reserve. They are occupying the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge HQ in protest of the expected detainment of two ranchers in the area who are expected to face federal arson charges. Ammon Bundy, the presumed leader of this ridiculous occupation, made a video that was later uploaded to social media, where he said: We re going to be freeing these lands up, and getting ranchers back to ranching, getting the loggers back to logging, getting the miners back to mining where they could do it under the protection of the people and not be afraid of this tyranny that s been set upon them. These people need to learn that they are not above the law. This  occupation  is illegal, and if they are taking up arms against the government they and all of their participants and supporters need to be hauled into federal custody and charged. That was the mistake before   Cliven Bundy and his right-wing militiamen never spent so much as a day behind bars for their insanity. Now, Ammon Bundy, his brothers, and other like-minded morons want to rule themselves free from government oversight in their own nutty enclave.Another presumed group leader, a man by the name of Blane Cooper, speaks in the video and trashes the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) as the equivalent of  high school bullies : Until that line is drawn and say  we ve had enough of this tyranny, you are going to leave us alone  it will not change. Cooper goes on to encourage more occupations like this one across the country: It doesn t have to stop here. This could be a hope that spreads through the whole country, the whole United States. Everybody s looking for this hope because the government has beat us, and oppressed us, and took everything from us; they will not stop until we tell them no. Perhaps this time, the feds will take these lunatics seriously and arrest them.Watch the video of this insane anti-government speech below:// < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js"," fjs);}(document"," 'script'"
" Cenk Uygur Rages At White Apathy After CPD Murders Black Teen (VIDEO)","On December 26, the father of 19-year-old Quintonio LeGrier called the police in hopes that they would help him deal with a situation he felt unqualified to handle.During an interview with CNN, the teen s father said that after hearing his son bang on the door, he grabbed the phone and called the police,  because I wasn t equipped with being able to understand how to deal with my angry son at that time.  The grieving father went on to say,  I figured the police would know better how to handle an angry situation my teenage son was going through. During the call, LeGrier described his son s behavior as  a little bit agitated. Far from assisting LeGrier s family, Chicago police shot and killed both the teen and a neighbor, a 55-year-old grandmother whose name was Bettie Jones.Contrary to police statements, we know from witness statements that the officer who killed Quintonio LeGrier opened fire from outside the house, shooting him seven times, from a distance of at least 20 feet away. We also know police made no attempt to talk to the teen. Instead, witnesses say they opened fire  right away. LeGrier s father was still upstairs when his son was killed. His parents report that there are bullet holes in the front door of the family s home.The officer who pulled trigger, described as a former marine in his early twenties, whose name has not been released to the media, reportedly said, F , no, no, no. I thought he was lunging at me with the [baseball] bat. A neighbor who spoke to Mother Jones, identified as DeSean, also witnessed the murder of LeGrier s neighbor, Bettie Jones.One of the officers walked up the stairs and knocked. Then he ran back to the sidewalk and drew his gun  like he was in position to shoot. The officer didn t say anything when he knocked on the door, DeSean said. Jones opened the door a few minutes later, he recalled. When [Jones] opened that door she was like,  Whoa, whoa, whoa! Like,  Slow down wait, wait, wait!  That s what she meant.  He said there had been 15 or 20 seconds between when Jones opened the door and when the officer opened fire.Police have referred to this shooting as  an accident.  It s clear from witness statements that there was nothing accidental about it.The police knocked on her door. Waited for her to open, then immediately shot her dead.According to the Chicago Sun-Times,Larry Rogers Jr., an attorney for the Jones family, said police need to be held accountable for how they treated Jones  daughter. The insensitivity that was shown by the police after the shooting occurred is of extreme concern for the family. One of the daughters asked one of the police officers,  Why did you shoot my mother?  His response was  Your mother s dead. Get over it,  Rogers said Sunday. You know what s insensitive?  said attorney Sam Adam Jr., who also represents the Jones family, gesturing to the presence of Jones  two daughters, LaToya and LaTarsha Jones.  They could at least send someone to clean up their mother s blood the day after Christmas. When the doorbell rang, she answered the doorbell and shortly after that she was shot to death,  Adam said.No attempt was ever made by police or rescue workers to provide medical attention to the two victims.During an episode of The Young Turks, published on December 31, host Cenk Uygur expressed outrage over the killing and the apathy of white Americans, when it comes to brutal, officer-involved killings such as this one.Watch the video here, courtesy of The Young Turks on Facebook. // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js"," fjs);}(document"," 'script'"

"JUST IN: CROOKED DOJ OFFICIAL Didnt Reveal That His Wife Was Being Paid By Fusion GPS to Get Dirt on Trump [Video]","We ve been covering the curious case of DOJ official Bruce Ohr and his wife Nellie Ohr What they did is so corrupt and underhanded! Nellie worked for the opposition research firm hired by the Democrats to get dirt on Trump (see below). Her husband would take whatever Nellie produced about Trump and hand it over to the FBI! Unreal! This should be jail time because of the omission of the conflict of interest being an ethics violation. So far, it appears as though Bruce Ohr has just been demoted.NOW WE FIND OUT THAT BRUCE OHR HID THE FUSION GPS PAYMENTS TO HIS WIFE:Daily Caller reports:Bruce Ohr, the Department of Justice official who brought opposition research on President Donald Trump to the FBI, did not disclose that Fusion GPS, which performed that research at the Democratic National Committee s behest, was paying his wife, and did not obtain a conflict of interest waiver from his superiors at the Justice Department, documents obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation show.The omission may explain why Ohr was demoted from his post as associate deputy attorney general after the relationship between Fusion GPS and his wife emerged and Fusion founder Glenn Simpson acknowledged meeting with Ohr. Willfully falsifying government ethics forms can carry a penalty of jail time, if convicted.The Democratic National Committee (DNC) hired Fusion GPS to gather and disseminate damning info about Trump, and they in turn paid Nellie Ohr, a former CIA employee with expertise in Russia, for an unknown role related to the  dossier.  Bruce Ohr then brought the information to the FBI, kicking off a probe and a media firestorm.The DOJ used it to obtain a warrant to wiretap a Trump adviser, but didn t disclose to the judge that the DNC and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton s campaign had funded the research and that Ohr had a financial relationship with the firm that performed it   which could be, it turns out, because Ohr doesn t appear to have told his supervisors. Some have suggested that the financial payments motivated Bruce Ohr to actively push the case.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON NELLIE OHR:This is a big deal even though we re sure the main stream media will ignore it.

"FLASHBACK: CNN HOST Concerned Working Americans Are Going To Vote For Donald Trump Again After Getting Bonuses and Pay Raises","CNN s Allyson Camerota expressed her concern about how the tax breaks for Americans will harm the Democrats chances of winning in the mid-term elections with Michigan s Democrat Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.Camerota appeared somewhat panicked, as she started out her segment whining to Dingell about bonuses and pay raises that Americans will receive as a result of Trump s GOP tax bill:  Just, ever since the tax reform was announced, or the tax overhaul, or whatever you want to call it, there have been this whole slew of companies that have come forward and saying,  Guess what? We re going to give out bonuses, now, to our employees.  I mean, I have just a partial list in front of me, and there s nine companies on here from AT&T, to Boeing, to Comcast, Bank of America, Sinclair, Wells Fargo, PNC. There s all sorts of companies that say they re going to give something to a thousand dollars worth of bonuses to their hundreds of thousands of employees. Fifth Bank Corp is gonna boost the minimum wage to $15 per hour. Obviously, they could have done this before the tax overhaul was announced. They were sitting on profits. But they didn t, they did it when the tax overhaul was announced. And I m wondering if you, as a Democrat are you worried about the wind in their sails? People vote with their pocketbooks. I don t have to tell you this. So if you get a thousand dollar bonus, you re voting for Donald Trump again. Although Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-MI) voted against the tax cut bill, she smartly responded to Camerota s question by saying that she s  never going to complain that any working man or woman will get an extra boost in their, uh, income.  Dingell then told Camerota that at some point a lot of people are still going to see a tax increase at some point. Camerota interrupted her to say,  Years from now Years from now!

This saddens me, especially at this time of year given all of the things we have to work on to help people. But in the spirit of this season and out of the sincerity of my heart, if it is perceived that I had anything to do with this, I am kind enough to simply say sorry.

There is no way you can see who is in a seat from inside the terminal.

"JUST IN: ROY MOORE Accuser ADMITS to FORGING Yearbook","The credibility of Beverly Young Nelson, the woman who accused Roy Moore of making sexual advances toward her when she was a teen, has been shattered.  Shortly after Nelson appeared on television with leftist attorney Gloria Allred,  her stepson made the difficult decision of coming out and saying that his stepmother was lying in a Facebook video he made to set the record straight about his father s wife.Watch video:(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = 'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.11';  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));My official statementPosted by Darrel Nelson on Tuesday, November 14, 2017Meanwhile, Twitter user Thomas Wictor made his case through a series of tweets that the alleged Roy Moore signature in a high school yearbook Nelson used as  evidence  of her story was forged. Conservative media outlets began to demand that the yearbook was examined by a neutral party. Nelson and her attorney, Gloria Allred refused. Nelson remained silent for weeks while the controversy about the allegedly forged high school yearbook continued to catch fire in the media.Breitbart News reports that Beverly Young Nelson has finally admitted that she forged a portion of the infamous high school yearbook that she and attorney Gloria Allred used as proof of her accusations against U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore.And in yet another blow to the credibility of ABC News, the disgraced, left-wing network downplayed the bombshell by presenting this admission of forgery as adding  notes  to the inscription. Worse still, the reporter actually coaches Nelson, puts words in her mouth, downplay the enormous significance of her deceit.Beverly Young Nelson, one of the women accusing GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct, tells @GMA it  sickens  her to think what might happen if Moore is elected. https://t.co/wuEGWr0kng pic.twitter.com/lcp5OY4x3A  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 8, 2017 Nelson admits she did make notes to the inscription,  ABC News tells us.  But the message was all Roy Moore. ABC News reporter Tom Llamas just couldn t help himself, as he coaches Nelson to make sure she is still able to cling to a portion of her story:Llamas:  Beverly, he signed your yearbook. Nelson:  He did sign it. Llamas, for his part encouraged her to get her story straight:  And you made some notes underneath. Nelson replied:  Yes. And then, after a woman admits to forging a document used in a campaign to destroy the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Alabama, ABC News quickly moves on as though it is not news of extraordinary consequence.Llamas also fails to ask any follow-ups, such as  If the explanation is this simple, why wait all these weeks to offer it?  Or,  Why did you lie? Nelson is accusing Moore of attempting to assault her when she was just 16-years-old. With the election just four days away, this admission of forgery could not come at a better time for Moore. Nelson and Allred are planning a news conference Friday, but nothing will overcome the forgery admission.How can anyone believe anything she says after admitting to such a thing? Early reports are that Nelson and Allred will produce an expert to prove the rest of the yearbook is not a forgery. So a proven forger is bringing in her own expert. What an insult to the people of Alabama.Another problem with Nelson is that she has a motive to lie and forge: as a circuit judge, Moore ruled against her in a 1999 divorce case.The Moore campaign has been pressuring Nelson and Allred for weeks to submit the yearbook for independent handwriting analysis. Now everyone knows why that request was rejected and ignored.With Nelson now thoroughly discredited, this leaves two accusers against Moore.One is Leigh Corfman, who claims Moore molested her as a 14-year-old child. She is the most credible of the three, but the narrative behind her story, that Moore s abuse resulted in Corfman s living a troubled life of  drinking, drugs, boyfriends, and a suicide attempt,  is directly contradicted by contemporaneous court records.Moore s final accuser is Tina Johnson, a woman who claims Moore groped her butt in his office in 1991. But, again, as was the case with Corfman and Nelson, the left-wing media outlets reporting these allegations (the Washington Post, AL.com) either failed to fully vet the accusers or withheld crucial context.Thanks to New Media s going behind these discredited outlets to fact check the reporting, we now know that Johnson did not tell the entire truth. She was not in Moore s office  on business.  If she was in Moore s office at all, it was due to a bitter custody battle where Moore represented Johnson s mother, who was trying to gain custody of Johnson s 12-year-old son based on the claim that Johnson was an  unfit, absent, and unstable mother. If the media and the accusers and Gloria Allred told the full truth to begin with, they would all be more credible.Here are close up versions of the signatures. Note, that when viewed close up, the signature is signed in both black and blue ink.Here is a closer version of the yearbook signature:Here is Wictor s explanation for the different colors of ink:(4) The LIGHT is reflecting off of the ink.The ink that LOOKS blue is actually black. It's DIFFERENT ink than the ORIGINAL ink.Therefore it reflects light differently.  Thomas Wictor (@ThomasWictor) November 16, 2017(11) So, to recap:The signature is a forgery, and everything after the name "Roy-Ray"" was added later with different ink. pic.twitter.com/1sPv6aABge  Thomas Wictor (@ThomasWictor) November 15"," 2017Just like the ""TH"" doomed Dan Rather"," ""DA"" will doom the anti Roy Moore forces.

"CREEPY BERNIE Calls For Trump To Step Down&What About Disgusting Essay BERNIE SANDERS WROTE About Women Fantasizing About Being Gang Raped or Men Fantasizing About Sexually Abusing Women?","Yesterday, Senator Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., went on a media blitz that was clearly coordinated by the Democrat Party, at about the same time Senator Al Franken (D-MN) was reluctantly resigning. Sanders took to his allies in the media to call on President Trump to resign over unproven allegations of sexual misconduct that were made against him during his campaign. By the way, it should not go without mentioning that we haven t heard a peep from any of Trump s accusers since he won the election. The Democrats are not going to give up that easily when it comes to ousting President Trump. Just this week, Democrats gave up the fight for Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) and Senator Al Franken (D-MN) (both of whom represented  safe  districts for Democrats), after multiple allegations of sexual assault and abuse. It was a clear play at attempting to convince voters that the Democrats are suddenly the party of morals.Do Democrats really believe Americans will be duped into believing that the party who cheated Bernie Sanders, (who wrote about how women fantasize about being gang-raped) out of the chance to be the Democrat nominee for President, to make Hillary Clinton, (a woman who has been accused of enabling her accused rapist husband, who has also been accused several times of sexual assault, and was impeached for lying about having sex with a 19-year old intern under his desk in the Oval Office) is somehow now the  moral  party?Here s  what Bernie had to say about President Trump yesterday:Washington Examiner    We have a president of the United States who acknowledged on a time widely seen all over this country that he assaulted women, so I would hope that maybe the POTUS might pay attention to what s going on and also think about resigning,  Sanders told CBS News on Thursday.Bernie recently said it was not up to the Senate or Democrat Party to call on Senator Franken to step down. Watch, as Sanders glosses over the question when asked about his previous statement (before Democrats decided Franken was a scalp they could spare for the sake of the party)."What I worry about right now"," as we speak"," in restaurants and in offices all over this country where you have bosses who are not famous"

The people briefed on the case said the transfer followed the discovery of text messages in which Mr. Strzok and a colleague reacted to news events, like presidential debates, in ways that could appear anti-Trump.ABC News reported back in August that Strzok had left the investigation, but said at the time  it s unclear why Strzok stepped away from Mueller s team of nearly two dozen lawyers, investigators and administrative staffers. And The Washington Post s report today on Strzok contains some rather, well, personal details:During the Clinton investigation, Strzok was involved in a romantic relationship with FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who worked for Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, according to the people familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.The extramarital affair was problematic, these people said, but of greater concern among senior law enforcement officials were text messages the two exchanged during the Clinton investigation and campaign season, in which they expressed anti-Trump sentiments and other comments that appeared to favor Clinton Officials are now reviewing the communications to see if they show evidence of political bias in their work on the cases, a review which could result in a public report, according to people familiar with the matter.

The people briefed on the case said the transfer followed the discovery of text messages in which Mr. Strzok and a colleague reacted to news events, like presidential debates, in ways that could appear anti-Trump.ABC News reported back in August that Strzok had left the investigation, but said at the time  it s unclear why Strzok stepped away from Mueller s team of nearly two dozen lawyers, investigators and administrative staffers. And The Washington Post s report today on Strzok contains some rather, well, personal details:During the Clinton investigation, Strzok was involved in a romantic relationship with FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who worked for Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, according to the people familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.The extramarital affair was problematic, these people said, but of greater concern among senior law enforcement officials were text messages the two exchanged during the Clinton investigation and campaign season, in which they expressed anti-Trump sentiments and other comments that appeared to favor Clinton Officials are now reviewing the communications to see if they show evidence of political bias in their work on the cases, a review which could result in a public report, according to people familiar with the matter.

"WILL OBAMA REGIME Be Held Accountable For Dirty Tactics They Used To Take Down MICHAEL FLYNN?","While we re on the subject of lying to the FBI, when will Hillary Clinton be prosecuted for multiple crimes she committed while acting as our Secretary of State?  Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn admitted Friday to making false statements to the FBI, entering the first guilty plea in Special Counsel Robert Mueller s Russia probe   and agreeing to cooperate with investigators.A source close to Flynn said financial and emotional pressure helped lead to the decision to plead guilty, rather than endure a drawn-out court battle.As part of the deal, Flynn already is supplying information about the actions of top Trump transition officials.Though the individuals are not named, court documents show Flynn claiming a  very senior member  of the Trump transition team directed him to contact foreign governments including Russia over a United Nations vote   discussions tied to one of Flynn s false statements.The documents also say Flynn called an unnamed senior transition official in December to ask what to communicate to the Russian ambassador about sanctions. That official and Flynn discussed how they didn t want Russia to  escalate the situation,  something Flynn immediately told the ambassador in a phone call.According to the plea deal, Flynn has agreed to  cooperate fully, truthfully, completely and forthrightly  with the probe, with sentencing delayed until those efforts  have been completed. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, becomes the first Trump ex-White House official charged in the special counsel probe.His tenure at the White House was brief   he was fired for similar conduct, pertaining to his undisclosed discussions with the Russians   and Flynn had been under investigation even before the special counsel probe over lobbying work for Turkey and other issues. The fact that he faced just one count prompted immediate speculation Friday that Flynn was cooperating and offering information to Mueller s team.As for the past discussions between Flynn and transition officials, it s unclear which senior officials the plea deal referred to. But a former senior intelligence officer with knowledge of Trump transition activities told Fox News that then-President-Elect Trump directed Flynn during that period to contact the Russians   while also directing him and his team to contact 12 other countries. The transition team felt that the Obama White House had completely abandoned any coherent foreign policy and had to fill the vacuum,  the former official told Fox News.In a statement, White House lawyer Ty Cobb said  nothing  about the plea implicates anyone other than Flynn. NBC News tweeted Cobb s statement:Today, Michael Flynn, a former National Security Advisor at the White House for 25 days during the Trump Administration, and a former Obama administration official, entered a guilty plea to a single count of making a false statement to the FBI. The false statements involved mirror the false statements to White House officials which resulted in his resignation in February of this year. Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn. The conclusion of this phase of the Special Counsel s work demonstrates again that the Special Counsel is moving with all deliberate speed and clears the way for a prompt and reasonable conclusion.

Yesterday, Black Caucus member, Congressman James Clyburn (D-SC) claimed that the women accusing Conyers of sexual misconduct were  all white women  or racists.

Clyburn said, these are all white women who ve made these charges against Conyers,  Robert Draper tweeted.When asked if that comment was true, Draper said he verified it through two sources, adding  Clyburn has used the Susan Smith parallel more than once, to members & staffers. Clyburn responded on Twitter, saying  This is inaccurate in many regards. The Congressional Black Caucus tweeted about the alleged Susan Smith comment, saying Clyburn  used the Smith example to illustrate the dangers of convicting people before getting all the facts.

"BLACK CAUCUS MEMBER From Impoverished Detroit District Whos Leading Effort To Impeach President Trump&CAUGHT Paying Off Sex Assault Victims With Taxpayer Money","This story is about more than a massive cover-up for an elected officials who sexually assaulted innocent women, it s also about the media s lack of desire to report about crimes that have obviously been covered up in DC for a very long time. Perhaps the media s reluctance to report about the sexual abuse taking place in Washington DC, is because most, if not all, of the elected officials whose crimes are now being uncovered, are Democrats? So far, two of the most rabid anti-Trump Democrats in Washington, Senator Al Franken (D-MI) and now Representative John Conyers (D-MI) have been outed is it a coincidence, or could it be that one of the reasons Democrats are so adamantly opposed to Trump s presidency is because he is shaking things up in Washington, and in doing so, he s breaking up the good ole  boys network?Buzzfeed   Michigan Rep. John Conyers, a Democrat and the longest-serving member of the House of Representatives, settled a wrongful dismissal complaint in 2015 with a former employee who alleged she was fired because she would not  succumb to [his] sexual advances. Documents from the complaint obtained by BuzzFeed News from Mike Cernovich, include four signed affidavits, three of which are notarized, from former staff members who allege that Conyers, the ranking Democrat on the powerful House Judiciary Committee, repeatedly made sexual advances to female staff that included requests for sexual favors, contacting and transporting other women with whom they believed Conyers was having affairs, caressing their hands sexually, and rubbing their legs and backs in public. Four people involved with the case verified the documents are authentic.And the documents also reveal the secret mechanism by which Congress has kept an unknown number of sexual harassment allegations secret: a grinding, closely held process that left the alleged victim feeling, she told BuzzFeed News, that she had no option other than to stay quiet and accept a settlement offered to her. I was basically blackballed. There was nowhere I could go,  she said in a phone interview. BuzzFeed News is withholding the woman s name at her request because she said she fears retribution.Last week the Washington Post reported that Congress s Office of Compliance paid out $17 million for 264 settlements with federal employees over 20 years for various violations, including sexual harassment. The Conyers documents, however, give a glimpse into the inner workings of the office, which has for decades concealed episodes of sexual abuse by powerful political figures.The woman who settled with Conyers launched the complaint with the Office of Compliance in 2014, alleging she was fired for refusing his sexual advances, and ended up facing a daunting process that ended with a confidentiality agreement in exchange for a settlement of more than $27,000. Her settlement, however, came from Conyers  office budget rather than the designated fund for settlements.Congress has no human resources department. Instead, congressional employees have 180 days to report a sexual harassment incident to the Office of Compliance, which then leads to a lengthy process that involves counseling and mediation, and requires the signing of a confidentiality agreement before a complaint can go forward.After this an employee can choose to take the matter to federal district court, but another avenue is available: an administrative hearing, after which a negotiation and settlement may follow.In this case, one of Conyers  former employees was offered a settlement, in exchange for her silence, that would be paid out of Conyers  taxpayer-funded office budget. His office would  rehire  the woman as a  temporary employee  despite her being directed not to come into the office or do any actual work, according to the document. The complainant would receive a total payment of $27,111.75 over the three months, after which point she would be removed from the payroll, according to the document.The draft agreement viewed by BuzzFeed News was unsigned, but congressional employment records match the timing and amounts outlined in the document. The woman left the office and never went public with her story.The process was  disgusting,  said Matthew Peterson, who worked as a law clerk representing the complainant, and who listed as a signatory to some of the documents.Hillary Clinton and John Conyers have been longtime friends. What is it about Hillary that sexual predators find so endearing?  It is a designed cover-up,  said Peterson, who declined to discuss details of the case but agreed to characterize it in general terms.  You feel like they were betrayed by their government just for coming forward. It s like being abused twice. Two staffers alleged in their signed affidavits that Conyers used congressional resources to fly in women they believed he was having affairs with.

"ROY MOORE WITCH HUNT UNRAVELLING: More Witnesses Step Forward To Refute Story Of Latest Roy Moore Accuser&OUCH!","This is truly shocking! Roy Moore takes a commanding lead in the Alabama Senatorial race as the allegations against him by the left and the RINO Republicans collapse. Check this out:Yesterday, the spread between the two leading candidates was 15 Today, it s 62 -40. While the internal polling for the Moore campaign had the spread at 5 points, it s looking really great for a Moore win in Alabama!NEW WITNESSES REFUTE THE ACCUSER S STORY:The witnesses say they ve shared the information with news outlets but to no one s surprise, the outlets refused to run the story. The employees who came forward offered details about the restaurant that refute the claims by the accuser. The calls for the arrest of Allred for the crime of forgery are getting louder. See the interesting discrepancies with the yearbook below:Roy Moore s campaign sent the following in a press release:GADSDEN, Ala.   On Monday evening, the Moore Campaign unveiled statements from key witnesses that completely bust the story of Beverly Nelson and Gloria Allred and further reveal an unconscionable bias on the part of state and national press to hide the truth from Alabama voters who will undoubtedly see through the  fake news  and elect Judge Moore for the man that they have always known him to be.Rhonda Ledbetter, a retired public school teacher who is currently the senior choir director at a Baptist church and teaches children at a local, church-sponsored day care center, was a waitress at Olde Hickory House for almost three years from 1977-1979. She was a college student at Jacksonville State University at the time and worked varying shifts at different times of day, multiple days a week during the time of her employment. She said in a statement:  When I heard Beverly Nelson s story, there were several details that were different from what I remember. I was nervous at coming forward because of all the attention this story has gotten, but as a moral and ethical person I had to speak up about what I know to be true. I was a waitress at Olde Hickory for almost three years from 1977-1979, and I never saw Roy Moore come in to the restaurant. Not one time. And I would have noticed because most of our customers weren t wearing suits, especially not at night. Many customers worked at Goodyear next door and would stop in on their way to and from work, and I don t remember anyone from the courthouse coming in at all. That just wasn t our crowd.   A few things stuck out to me. First, Nelson said she was 15 years old when she started working there but you had to be 16. I don t remember her from my time there, and I don t remember any 15 year olds working there at all. Second, Nelson said the restaurant closed at 10 p.m. but I know the earliest it closed was 11, though I believe it was midnight. I m certain of that because Goodyear employees came in to eat after their shift ended at 10:00 p.m., so there s no way we would have closed at that time. Third, the area wasn t dark and isolated as she described. Rather, the building was right off the busy four-lane highway and people and cars were always around. The restaurant had a wrap-around porch, like the ones at Cracker Barrel restaurants, and there were lights all around the sides of the building. So it wasn t dark and anyone in the parking lot was visible from the road. Fourth, the dumpsters were to the side of the building, not around back and there sure wasn t room to park in between the building and the dumpsters. People from the kitchen would take trash out of the side door and throw it right into the dumpsters. We were always told to park on the side of the building, because there just wasn t much room behind it. I don t remember there being an exit from the back of the parking lot, there would barely have been enough room to turn a car around. I came forward because from what I ve seen, the media is only interested in reporting one side of this story. In fact, Dixon Hayes from WRBC in Birmingham asked for former employees to contact him but never responded when I told him I never saw Roy Moore come into Olde Hickory House during the three years I worked for. Two other news outlets in the state asked to interview me and I agreed, but neither one has aired my interview and I have to wonder why they don t think the people of Alabama deserve to hear anything that counteracts the accusations against Judge Moore. It s not for me to say whether or not something happened, I can only tell the truth about factual details that I know for sure. I think all Alabamians deserve to have all of the facts so they can decide for themselves what the truth is. Despite what the national media and people in DC might say, Alabama voters are intelligent and have common sense. We don t need anyone to tell us how to vote or to explain to us what really happened. We will make that decision and I just wanted to do my part in sharing the truth on some of these important facts. I, like all Alabama voters, want any and all information that can shed light on the truth. Johnny Belyeu, Sr. is a former police officer with over two decades of experience with the Etowah County Sheriff s Department and the Gadsden Police Department. He said in a statement,  I was an officer with the Etowah County Sheriff s Department in the 1970s which means I worked in the courthouse and knew who Roy Moore was since he was the Deputy District Attorney at the time. I was a regular customer at Olde Hickory House, and I never once saw Judge Moore come in there. If he had I would have immediately recognized him. I also never met Beverly Nelson during any of the many times I frequented the restaurant, and I can t say that she even worked there. Renee Schivera of Huntsville, Alabama stated,  I was a waitress at the Olde Hickory House during the summer of 1977, before my senior year of high school. When I heard Beverly Nelson s story the first thing that stuck out to me was that I don t remember Roy Moore ever coming into the restaurant. I also don t remember her working there. The other thing that struck me as odd is that from my best recollection, the dumpsters were to the side of the building. I just know they were visible from the road, and not back behind the building. But the main thing is that if someone came in almost every night we knew who there were, and I never saw Roy Moore there. As a Christian woman, I wouldn t lie for anyone and I am only sharing what I know because it s the truth. The days of unbiased reporting are over,  Moore Campaign strategist, Brett Doster said.  The liberal media will dodge any source and refuse to air any interview that doesn t square with their effort to land a liberal Democrat in the senate seat. The Moore Campaign is committed to presenting factual truth to the people of Alabama and looks forward to victory on December 12.

"Viewers Are DEMANDING Shepard Smith Be FIRED After Fox News Leftist Host, Shepard Smith, Pulled UNBELIEVABLE Propaganda Stunt Last Night [VIDEO]","Only one day ago, FOX News published a factual story outlining Hillary s involvement in the sale of uranium to Russia while she was acting as Barack Obama s Secretary of State.Fox News  What was the Uranium One deal?In 2013, Rosatom, backed by the Russian state, acquired a Canadian uranium mining company, now called Uranium One, which has assets in the U.S. Uranium is key to making nuclear weapons.Through the deal, Russia is able to own about 20 percent of U.S. uranium production capacity. However, Colin Chilcoat, an energy affairs specialist who has written extensively about Russia s energy deals, said that the company only extracts about 11 percent of uranium in the U.S.The deal also  doesn t allow for that uranium to be exported at all,  Chilcoat told Fox News.  It s not like it s leaving the U.S. or somehow finding its way to more insidious players. The agreement was approved by nine government agencies with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), an inter-agency group that reviews how certain foreign investments can impact national security. Clinton s State Department was one of those agencies, though the former secretary of state told WMUR-TV in 2015 that she was not  personally involved  in the agreement.Why is it controversial? Republicans have largely decried the deal, especially as some investors reportedly donated millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton also received a $500,000 speaking fee in Russia and reportedly met with Vladimir Putin around the time of the deal.The FBI had looked into the agreement and uncovered that some Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in nefarious dealings, which included extortion, bribery, and kickbacks, The Hill reported. Evidence of wrongdoing by Vadim Mikerin, the Russian official overseeing Putin s nuclear expansion in the U.S. who was eventually sentenced to prison, was discovered by the FBI before the deal was approved, according to The Hill.Author Peter Schweizer   who wrote about the deal in his 2015 book  Clinton Cash    told Fox News that there is no evidence that the people involved with approving the agreement knew that the FBI had an ongoing investigation into it.Republicans say the whole affair raises serious questions. Now it s the Democrats who have some explaining to do,  Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement.  I hope they will cooperate with the investigation, be forthcoming with the American people and I expect the media to cover these new developments with the same breathless intensity that they have given to this investigation since day one. Yesterday, the liberal Fox News host, Shepard Smith infuriated a large number of the network s viewers on Tuesday after a six-minute segment in which he debunked far-right conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton s alleged wrongdoing in a sale of American uranium. The segment was surprising given that a number of broadcasters on Smith s own network have promoted the idea that Clinton broke the law in approving the sale to foreign buyers who also donated to her husband s foundation.Smith said many claims about Clinton s supposed role in the uranium sale were  inaccurate    even as President Donald Trump and his supporters are calling for a federal investigation.The Fox News host began the segment by summarizing the particulars of the sale of Uranium One, a Canadian firm with rights to mine US uranium.Rosatom, a Russian firm, acquired a majority stake in Uranium One in 2010 and bought the remainder of the company in 2013.The segment infuriated Fox News viewers who demanded Smith be fired. Shep Smith needs to be fired for his biased reporting,  tweeted one Fox News viewer.  Daily Mail Twitter went nuts over the 6-minute propaganda piece on FOX News last night.Here are just a few of the tweets that blasted the whiny, liberal FOX News host for his disgusting liberal bias.Shepard Smith: AFFIRMATIVE ACTIONThe wrench in the @FoxNews wheel.PLEASE DUMP THE HACK.   pic.twitter.com/6xQnDBcA7K  thebradfordfile (@thebradfordfile) November 15, 2017Raise your hand  If you change the channel when thisObnoxiousFake Overly made-upLiberal shillBeta maleComes on@FoxNews #FireShep Shepard Smith Covers for Hillary, Spreads FAKE NEWS on #UraniumOne#WednesdayWisdom https://t.co/MBTIXz7uHz via @truthfeednews  SparkleMAGA  (@SparkleSoup45) November 15, 2017Most viewers of FOX  News question why the only conservative-leaning cable news show would want someone like Shepard Smith driving viewers away.

"BOOM! SARAH HUCKABEE SANDERS Sets Media Straight On Difference Between Trump Volunteers Meeting and Clinton-DNC Paying Millions For Fake Russian Dossier","Daily Caller   The revelation on Monday that former Trump campaign adviser George Papadopoulos has plead guilty to lying to the FBI about his contacts with Russian operatives thrust the little-known energy consultant into the national spotlight.Few details have been reported about the 30-year-old Papadopoulos, including how he ended up on the Trump campaign.Gateway Pundit reports that Papadopoulos was a volunteer whose repeated attempts to set up meetings between Trump s camp and Russians were outright rejected.The Washington Post reported back in August that Papadopoulos attempted to set up several meetings with Russia and all were rejected by Trump s camp.Watch Sarah Huckabee Sanders break down the difference between a Trump volunteer and Hillary and the DNC, who all of a sudden seems to have a renewed interest in Russian collusion again, after ignoring the bombshell revelation that Hillary and the DNC paid millions of dollars to create a phony Trump-Russia dossier. Sanders tells CBS News  Major Garrett,  The big difference here is you have a meeting that took place versus millions of dollars being sent to create fake information to actually influence the election. You compare those two, those are apples and oranges.What the Clinton campaign did, what the DNC did, was actually exchange money. They took a meeting. Those are far different. And one is pretty common practice in any campaign   to take a meeting. The other one is actually paying money for false information. That s a big deal and a big difference.

"WATCH: SANCTIMONIOUS ANTI-TRUMP Hollywood IMPLODES&Best Friends Turn On Each Other To Save Their Careers and Their New Movie SUBURBICON","Anti-Trump besties Matt Damon and George Clooney sat down with Good Morning America s Michael Strahan to discuss their good friend, Democrat mega-donor and accused rapist and serial sexual predator, Harvey Weinstein. Not only did both actors, who owe much of their successful careers to Harvey Weinstein, wait until their reputations were on the line to speak out about the sexual predator, but they waited until only days before their new movie,  SUBURBICON  is about to debut, to say that they actually knew more about the abuse women received at the hands of the bully movie mogul than they had previously admitted to.Notably absent in the interview is the third actor Ben Affleck, who completes the trio of bestie actors. After Affleck spoke out on the Harvey Weinstein controversy, he was also accused of covering up Weinstein s behavior, as well as videos that show Affleck used his power to prey on innocent women. Notice how quickly Damon throws Affleck under the bus, saying he knew, but only told Damon (who of course, never told anyone else).Americans who are sick and tired of sanctimonious, holier-than-thou liberals who have no values or morals, yet try to shame Americans for supporting political candidates who don t hold the same liberal views as theirs, are left with only one option #BoycottSuburbicon and #BoycottHollywood In the interview that aired on Monday morning, George Clooney and Matt Damon said that they knew Weinstein was a  bully  and  womanizer  who bragged of bedding actresses but had no idea about the level of criminal behavior that was occurring behind closed doors in hotels.Damon also confessed that he was aware Weinstein had sexually harassed  the first lady of Miramax  Gwyneth Paltrow just before the actress shot the 1996 film adaptation of Jane Austen s  Emma  for the studio. I knew the story about Gwyneth from Ben [Affleck] because he was with her after Brad [Pitt] and so I knew that story,  said Damon. But I was working with Gwyneth and with Harvey on [the 1999 film  The Talented Mr.] Ripley. He then added:   I never talked to Gwyneth about it but Ben told me that whatever or agreement they had come to there was an understanding   and he treated her incredibly respectfully. Always. Affleck and Pitt have not spoken about the incident, and Damon s revelation that he learned about Weinstein s behavior from his friend may cause even more problems for the embattled actor as it seems to contradict his initial statement. I am saddened and angry that a man who I worked with used his position of power to intimidate, sexually harass and manipulate many women over decades,  said Affleck almost one week after news of the scandal broke in a carefully-worded response that seemed to suggest he had never before heard any of the allegations.Damon s decision to characterize the relationship between Paltrow and Weinstein as  always  respectful is a bit odd as well, considering her admission that she had been sexually harassed by the mogul is part of the reason the men were sitting down for the interview.Clooney meanwhile said that like many of Weinstein s victims, he had been told a number of times by the mogul that he was bedding a number of stars. Harvey would talk to me about women that he had had affairs with,  said Clooney. I didn t necessarily believe him quite honestly because to believe him would be to believe the worst of some actresses who were friends of mine, and I didn t really think that they had affairs with Harvey   and clearly, they didn t.He then added:  But the idea that this predator, this assaulter was out there silencing women like that, it s beyond infuriating. And the fact that the story is coming out now and the more it comes out, I want to know all of it.

Republicans, in an effort to pass the tax code, have explored trying to pass tax reform without Democratic support; while Democrats have complained that they have been left out of a crucial, bipartisan process in governing.Included in the GOP tax plan is a 20% corporate tax rate, the elimination of the estate tax, and the implementation of three tax brackets.Cruz defended the plan, saying on CNN,  Republicans want to lower the taxes for each and every person watching this debate,  and said that lowering the corporate tax rate would allow businesses to create more jobs.Sanders, however, said the GOP s tax plan is about giving  tax breaks to people who don t need it.  The senator said he supports  a tax cut for the middle class and working families. Throughout the evening, the two senators threw several verbal jabs at each other s expense.At one point, Cruz claimed that his 2016 presidential campaign tried to strengthen social security and said politicians in Washington were  recklessly letting it careen towards insolvency. There are no changes at all,  Cruz said.  Every dollar, every penny of benefit is protected, but for young people, people my age  You re not so young anymore,  Sanders replied.

"YIKES! ACADEMY AWARD WINNING Actor Starring In Harvey Weinsteins New Batman Movie: Children UNDER 16 Are Immensely Attractive","Batman fans who have been looking forward to the upcoming Batman sequel,  Justice League , a Harvey Weinstein produced movie, that is set to be released before Christmas of 2017, have taken to social media, demanding that the studio replace the Batman actor Ben Affleck. A close friend of the now disgraced Hollywood kingpin producer and sexual predator, Harvey Weinstein, Ben Affleck, has received quite a bit of criticism after women in the industry came forward to accuse him of being complicit in Weinstein s behavior, and have even accused him of disgusting and inappropriate sexual behavior toward women in the industry.The lone female superhero, Gal Gadot, who plays Wonder Woman in the upcoming movie, recently came out with a statement of support for fellow actresses who have been victims of sexual abuse and condemnation for their sexual harassers: Ben Affleck, who stars as Batman in the Harvey Weinstein Batman Vs. Superman movie is not the only actor who should be shunned by moviegoers. It s time for the spotlight to be shined on a few of the other actors in the Weinstein movie, including  Justice League  actor Jeremy Irons.Actor Jeremy Irons, who won a  Best Actor  Academy Award for his role in  Reversal of Fortune , is set to play the role of Batman s butler, Alfred J. Pennyworthy in Weinstein s Batman sequel  Justice League . Hollywood has clearly been ignoring sexual predators like Harvey Weinstein, Woody Allen, and Ben Affleck for decades, so it s not too surprising that Jeremy Irons has somehow managed to escape scrutiny by the media, and by his fellow Hollywood actors, after the disgusting remarks he made following his lead role as a pedophile in the controversial  Lolita  movie.In 1998, Jeremy Irons starred as a pedophile in the movie Lolita, that was based on a 1955 novel written by Russian American novelist Vladimir Nabokov. The novel is notable for its controversial subject: the protagonist and unreliable narrator a middle-aged literature professor called Humbert Humbert is obsessed with the 12-year-old Dolores Haze, with whom he becomes sexually involved after he becomes her stepfather.  Lolita  is his private nickname for Dolores.Telegraph   The actor Jeremy Irons, who starred in the film Lolita, says the  hysteria  sweeping the country over pedophilia is damaging relations between adults and children.Irons, who has two sons with his wife Sinead Cusack, says it is important to uphold a rigid social morality but also vital that adults are allowed to show affection to children.Pedophilia should be treated as a disease, he says in a BBC interview to be screened next week. But it must also be recognized that children are attractive and that parental love has a  sexual  element. It is very difficult because children under 16 are immensely attractive,  he says.  Any father will tell you. I think our children have to be protected. But I don t think we need to have hysteria. In the interview, Irons says his character was not a pedophile in the strict sense, as he  knew that what he was doing was wrong . Referring to his family, he describes the difficulties of judging the line between natural affection and pedophilia. I remember when my son was 12 and he was like a god. He just went through that sort of golden time for about 18 months. I don t have a daughter but they do the same. Parental love is sexual. Children practice on their parents. Girls will flirt outrageously with their fathers because they are practicing. But we should know that that is practice. Boys will flirt outrageously with their mothers in a different way. His comments were seized on by child protection charities. The NSPCC said:  Such comments are ambiguous and could be interpreted by sex offenders as a justification for their behavior. Esther Rantzen, the chairman of ChildLine, said:  The words  immensely attractive  are not the best thing to say about children under 16.  Appealing or charming  are more appropriate. Irons, 56, made the remarks when asked about his portrayal of Humbert Humbert, the lecturer who falls for a young girl in the film of Vladimir Nabokov s novel Lolita. When the film came out in 1998, he suggested that child abuse did not always ruin the life of the victim.In the video below, Jeremy Irons arrogantly discusses his own brilliance as he portrays a pedophile in  Lolita . Go to the 7:50 mark to hear Irons tell the interviewers how  devastatingly attractive  many 15-year-old girls are. The greatness of the performance that Dominique Swain gives, is that she is all of our daughters. Funny, wacky, silly, attractive, because many girls of 15 are devastatingly attractive. WATCH:Irons also once posed the question about whether or not a son should be able to marry his father:NYDN -Academy Award-winning actor Jeremy Irons said Wednesday that while he doesn t have much of a strong opinion either way on same-sex marriage, he believes it poses interesting questions, including whether allowing same-sex marriage would open the door for interfamilial relationships. Could a father not marry his son?  Irons asked HuffPost Live host Josh Zepps. Irons argued that  it s not incest between men  because  incest is there to protect us from inbreeding, but men don t breed,  and wondered whether same-sex marriage might allow fathers to pass on their estates to their sons without being taxed.Jason Momoa who plays  Aquaman  in in Weinstein s  Justice League  movie was recently attacked on social media after a video was being circulated of him making a disgusting  joke  during a public forum, where he bragged about the benefit of being able to play  Khal Drogo  on the  Game of Thrones  series, and how he is able to  rape beautiful women and get away with it .   Weinstein s  Justice Leauge  movie,  surfaced on Twitter, where he was seen discussing as far as sci-fi and fantasy, I love that there s so many things you can do like rip someone s tongue out of their throat and get away with it and rape beautiful women.

Roberts mentioned that Trump fired back in a tweet that he hoped Hillary would run again in 2020. Trump interrupted to say:  Oh I hope Hillary runs! Is she going to run? Please, Hillary, run again!   Trump responded that her way of agreeing with the players disrespecting our flag is the reason she lost the election, saying,  Well, that s why she l the election. I mean honestly, it s that thinking is why she lost the election. Trump said that he believes that Hillary s statement  in itself, is very disrespectful to our country.

"WATCH: HANOI JANE FONDA Had Chance To Expose Sexual Predator Harvey Weinstein One Year Ago&The Reason DIDNT Is LAUGHABLE","Speaking to Bill Maher about her participation in the Women s March in DC,  Hanoi Jane  Fonda remarked about her ability to use her celebrity to express her hate for Donald Trump to the masses. Fonda told Maher that one of the benefits of being a celebrity is that you can bring attention to things that need to be addressed, she then went on to refer to President Trump as the  Predator in Chief . Of course, Hanoi Jane had no evidence whatsoever to back up such a hideous claim, yet, she made the claim anyhow. As it turns out, Hanoi Jane actually knew about a certain sexual predator who actually assaulted a much younger actress only one year ago. That younger actress was Rosana Arquette, who shared her horrible experience with the  celebrity  Jane Fonda. Fonda, who bragged about having so much power to bring attention to important issues, did absolutely nothing about it.Hypocrite Hanoi Jane would rather stay mum about an actual sexual predator who was harming so many young women in her industry, than risk being ostracized in Hollywood. It was better to just stick to the  hate Trump  script and get along with the other sickening hypocrites in Hollywood than to expose a serial sexual predator who should ve been stopped years ago if there weren t so many self-serving and shallow human beings running around Hollywood. Watch:Hanoi Jane s very comfortable trashing President Trump who she believes can t hurt her career, but when it comes to the mega-Democrat donor, and Hollywood kingpin producer, Harvey Weinstein, all bets are off..

"MIKE DITKA SLAMS NFL Players: No Oppression In Last 100 Years&If You Dont Respect Our Country, Then You Shouldnt Be In This Country Playing Football","Wow! Former Bears coach Mike Ditka is coming under fire from the liberal media and Black Lives Matter activists for saying there has been  no oppression in the last 100 years .Former Chicago Bears star and coach Mike Ditka, an adamant critic of NFL players kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial discrimination, said Monday in a national radio interview that this country has been free of oppression for at least a century. All of a sudden, it s become a big deal now, about oppression,  Ditka told Jim Gray on Westwood One s pregame show ahead of the Bears   Monday Night Football  loss to the Vikings.  There has been no oppression in the last 100 years that I know of. Now maybe I m not watching it as carefully as other people. As a side note, the now unemployed and clearly  oppressed  49 ers QB, Colin Kaepernick who started kneeling to show his unity with the anti-cop, Black Lives Matter movement, listed his humble abode in San Jose, CA, 10 months ago, for a mere $2.9 million.According to Realtor.com, the gated four-bedroom, 5.5-bath estate features 4,500 square feet of living space on a 20,000-square-foot secluded lot with a long private driveway and expansive views of the valley.Ditka continued: Is that the stage for this? If you want to protest, or whatever you want to protest, you ve got a right to do that, but I think you re a professional athlete, you have an obligation to the game,  Ditka said.  I think you have to respect the game. That s what I think is the most important thing. I don t see a lot of respect for the game. I just see respect for their own individual opinions. Opinions are like noses, we all have one. Some are good. Some are bad. Ditka insisted he wasn t  condemning anybody or criticizing anybody  but urged players to  protest when the game s over, protest whatever other way you want to  and said he would bench players who insisted on demonstrating during the anthem because it s disrespectful. If you don t respect our country, then you shouldn t be in this country playing football,  he said.  Go to another country and play football. If you had to go somewhere else to try to play the sport, you wouldn t have a job. So that would be my take. If you can t respect the flag and the country, then you don t respect what this is all about. So I would say, adios. Gray cited athletes such as Muhammad Ali and Jesse Owens who have taken on social injustices, but Ditka was unmoved. I don t know what social injustices have been,  Ditka said.  Muhammad Ali rose to the top. Jesse Owens is one of the classiest individuals that ever lived. I mean, you can say,  Are you (saying) everything is based on color?  I don t see it that way. I think that you have to be color blind in this country. You ve got to look at a person for what he is and what he stands for and how he produces, not by the color of his skin. That has never had anything to do with anything. Ditka said there are opportunities for everyone in the United States, regardless of race, religion, creed, color, nationality  if you want to work, if you want to try, if you want to put effort into yourself. I think you can accomplish anything, and we have watched that throughout our history of our country. People rise to the top and they became very influential people in our country by doing the right things.   Trib LiveMost of America gets what Ditka is trying to say when he says there has been  no oppression for 100 years . He s clearly referring to the era of slavery. The idea, however, that Ditka would point out that slavery ended 100 years ago, and that we are, and have been, for decades, a nation of equal opportunity for all, was more than the left and the liberal media could bear. Here are just a few of their responses to Ditka s remarks:Mike Ditka said that, Black folks have not suffered, "any oppression over last 100 years.  and Mike Ditka was alive during the Jim Crow era  LEFT  (@LeftSentThis) October 10"," 2017Just heard Mike Ditka say on a radio interview that there hasn t been oppression in the US in 100 years.

In case anyone forgot, Hillary Clinton actually was called a  nasty woman  by then-candidate Trump during one of the presidential debates. Hillary and her liberal Hollywood friends turned Trump s remark about her into a fundraiser to support abortion. The t-shirt was in response to President Trump s tweet criticizing the politician where he referred to her actions as  nasty  and NOT the mayor. It hasn t taken the American public long to figure out that the mayor of San Juan is not only  nasty , but ungrateful and apparently, someone who just can t get enough attention.

"BREAKING REPORT: HILLARY SUPPORTER, CEO Of Las Vegas MGM and Mandalay Bay Resort Asked Employees To Donate To CAIR Only 2 Months Ago, Wife Worked For Obama","On August 15, 2017, Jim Murren, CEO of MGM which owns Mandalay Bay Casino and Resort, came out with a bold statement of support for Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign: As a lifelong registered Republican, I ve crossed the aisle only a few times in elections past, and almost never at the presidential level. Each time, it was a gut-wrenching decision.But this year it s an easy choice. I m going to put my country ahead of my party by voting for Hillary Clinton   and by making my first-ever public endorsement of a presidential candidate. Breaking from investigative reporter Laura Loomer*: EXCLUSIVE: In this internal memo I have obtained, Jim Murren, the CEO of MGM resorts which owns Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino (where Stephen Paddock committed his massacre) asked employees to donate to CAIR, a documented terrorist organization, two months ago.Murren declared that he d match all donations from his employees to CAIR, and radical left-wing anti -Trump groups like Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL   Anti-Defamation League. His wife, Heather Murren also worked for the Obama administration on Obama s  Commission for Enhancing National Cybersecurity  in 2016.When this memo first came out from the MGM CEO to his employees, Wayne Allen Root wrote in the Townhall publication about his disgust for a CEO of a major company asking his employees to donate to these radical groups, many of which, are in direct conflict with conservative and Christian values.Why is the MGM CEO asking his employees to contribute to radical, left-wing organizations? Why did the killer choose to stay in the Mandalay Casino? Why is no one reporting about the fact that the wife of the MGM CEO worked for Obama on his Commission for Enhancing National Cybersecurity  only one year ago?What about the fact that receipts that allegedly came from the Mandalay Casino Resort show that there were 2 GUESTS in the room with the shooter and that he actually checked in one day before the date of check-in that s being reported.Again, more from investigative journalist Laura Loomer*:BREAKING: Copies of receipts from the Las Vegas shooter s room service were posted by Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino room service employee Tony Hernandez Armenta. The receipts confirm my previous reporting that Stephen Paddock checked into the resort prior to Sept. 28. The receipts are dated Sept. 27, 2017, and indicate that there were 2 GUESTS inside the room at the time of service. My source who works at the Mandalay told me Paddock s reservation began on Sept. 25, all of which proves that Las Vegas law enforcement and FBI aren t providing accurate information to the public.   All of a sudden, there s been a shift in the investigation. There seems to be a new focus on  radicalization  of the shooter.Las Vegas Sheriff Lombardo is now suggesting that the shooter was  radicalized  and that they are  attempting to uncover the source  of his radicalization:BREAKING: Sheriff Lombardo suggests shooter was "radicalized"" & authorities attempting to uncover source. pic.twitter.com/HtoIxRhvvA  Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) October 3"," 2017*Laura Loomer is an independent journalist and conservative activist.

San Juan s mayor, Carmin Yulin Cruz, used CNN as a vehicle to criticize the efforts of the US in getting much-needed supplies to the residents of San Juan. Only hours after the mayor of San Juan criticized the efforts of the Trump administration, tweets from the Mayor of San Juan, (that were sent out before Hurricane Maria) surfaced on Twitter responding to Hillary s tweet, as she trashed President Trump, saying he  doesn t deserve to be President. .@realDonaldTrump hater, the Mayor of San Juan   is the perfect example of an opportunistic politician.

Valle ( Torch ), Commander, 101st Air and Space Operations Group, and Director of the Joint Air Component Coordination Element, 1st Air Force, responsible for Hurricane Maria relief efforts, has the following comment: They have the generators, water, food, medicine, and fuel on the ground, yet the supplies are not moving across the island as quickly as they re needed.Col. Valle is a firsthand witness of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) response supporting FEMA in Puerto Rico, and as a Puerto Rican himself with family members living in the devastation, his passion for the people is second to none.  It s just not true,  Col. Valle says of the major disconnect today between the perception of a lack of response from Washington verses what is really going on on the ground.  I have family here. My parents  home is here. My uncles, aunts, cousins, are all here. As a Puerto Rican, I can tell you that the problem has nothing to do with the U.S. military, FEMA, or the DoD. It s a lack of drivers for the transport trucks, the 18 wheelers. Supplies we have. Trucks we have. There are ships full of supplies, backed up in the ports, waiting to have a vehicle to unload into. However, only 20% of the truck drivers show up to work. These are private citizens in Puerto Rico, paid by companies that are contracted by the government .. (link)Colonel Valle blames the conditions of the roads for the lack of truck drivers to move supplies around Puerto Rico, but the video below tells another story.The ports are so full of relief supplies they can t fit any more in the available space.

"MELANIA FIRES BACK At Disgusting Liberal Librarian Who Called Her Gift Of Books To Students RACIST","First lady Melania Trump fired back Friday at a Massachusetts elementary school librarian who rejected her donation of Dr. Seuss books, claiming their illustrations are examples of  racist propaganda. Stephanie Grisham, director of communications for the first lady s office, said in a statement to Fox News that the response was  unfortunate,  and Mrs. Trump wanted to use her platform  to help as many children as she can. She has demonstrated this in both actions and words since her husband took office, and sending books to children across the country is but one example,  she said.  To turn the gesture of sending young students some books into something divisive is unfortunate, but the First Lady remains committed to her efforts on behalf of children everywhere. To celebrate  National Read a Book Day,  the first lady had sent out a collection of 10 Dr. Seuss books to one school in each state across the nation. The titles included:  The Cat in the Hat ;  One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish ;  Wacky Wednesday ;  Green Eggs and Ham ; and  Oh, the Places You ll Go! She followed in the footsteps of her predecessor, Michelle Obama, who often read Dr. Seuss books to children. Former first ladies Hillary Clinton and Barbara Bush also read to children at Dr. Seuss-themed educational events.Remember when Mooch read Seuss to a room full of kids at the White House? Hmmm was Mooch promoting racism? I wanted to send you a special gift. Dr. Seuss s Oh, the Places You ll Go! is a book my son and I have read over and over again, and one that we want to share with all of you,  the first lady wrote in her letter to students.  Please also remember that you are the future of America and that you can accomplish anything you set your mind to. But despite the gesture, Liz Phipps Soeiro, a librarian at a public school in Cambridge, wrote a letter to the first lady, which was then published on The Horn Book blog, notifying Mrs. Trump that her school would  not be keeping the titles  for their collection, explaining that her school didn t have a  NEED  for the books, due to her school and library s  award-winning  status.  FOX News100 Percent Fed Up  Soeiro on Tuesday penned an editorial for the Horn Book s Family Reading blog explaining why her school did not need the donation. My students have access to a school library with over nine thousand volumes and a librarian with a graduate degree in literary science,  she wrote. Multiple studies show that schools with professionally staffed libraries improve student performance,  Soeiro added.Trump s package reportedly included such Seuss classics as  Green Eggs and Ham,   The Cat in the Hat  and  One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish. Soeiro criticized Seuss for being the only author represented in Trump s donation, citing controversy over some of his illustrations. You may not be aware of this, but Dr. Seuss is a bit of a clich , a tired and worn ambassador for children s literature,  she told Trump. Another fact that many people are unaware of is that Dr. Seuss s illustrations are steeped in racist propaganda, caricatures, and harmful stereotypes. I work in a district that has plenty of resources, which contributes directly to  excellence,  Soeiro wrote.  My students have access to a school library with over nine thousand volumes and a librarian with a graduate degree in library science. Soeiro went on to slam the White House and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos for not gifting the books to  underfunded and underprivileged communities,  which she suggested  continue to be marginalized  by DeVos  policies.But Soeiro seemed to be the most offended by the books themselves.Another FACT that many people are unaware that the HYPOCRITICAL and smug liberal librarian was seen CELEBRATING Dr. Seuss only 2 years ago:Here's D.C. librarian who rejected Melania's Dr. Seuss book donation "steeped in racist propaganda"" as Cat in Hat. pic.twitter.com/pek3pT5q2W  Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) September 29"," 2017"",politics

"WATCH: DETROIT ARTIST Takes Knee and Raises Fist While Singing National Anthem At Lions Game&Young Boys Standing Next To Him Appear To Be Confused","Local artist Rico Lavelle was given the distinct honor and privilege of singing the national anthem on the Ford Field at the start of the Lions football game on Sunday. Singing the national anthem has always been about honoring our flag and the brave women and men it represents who have given their lives for our nation. The seriousness of what happened near the end of Lavelle s performance cannot be understated. Rico Lavelle used his privilege to honor our flag and our military to instead, take a stand against our current President, to support a divisive, Black Lives Matter, anti-cop movement, and to salute the violent Black Panthers on a national stage.The video in and of itself is very disturbing as it shows a total and utter lack of respect for the honor bestowed upon Lavelle, but if you watch closely, you ll see 3 or 4 young black boys who also had the privilege of taking part of the national anthem on the field. Sadly, the young boys appear to be confused about what the local artist Rico Lavelle, aka Midwest Rico, is doing when he kneels and raises his fist. Perpetuating the lie that America is more racially divided now than ever before, or that all police officers are bad people is (hopefully) not why the Lions asked Lavelle to honor our flag with his rendition of the  Star Spangled Banner .Watch:Rico Lavelle sang the anthem AND took a knee pic.twitter.com/mgno4HCzZQ  Jasmine (@JasmineLWatkins) September 24, 2017Lavelle s performance didn t end on the field, he immediately took to Twitter to criticize President Trump for being  Un-American .How can the "leader"" of the free world be so UN-American?  rico lavelle   (@midwestrico) September 24"," 2017Later on Twitter"," Lavelle retweeted a message of encouragement from the Boston Globe Deputy Washington Bureau Chief and CNN contributor"

The allegations of sexual misconduct surfaced after a  Huffington Post reporter Yahsar Ali interviewed women who said he sent them inappropriate texts that contained sexual content.Eric Bolling, like Fox News host Sean Hannity, decided to fight back, and not take what he calls  false allegations  sitting down. Sean Hannity was a target of washed up blogger and lawyer Debbie Schlussel until he hired a team of lawyers who threatened to sue her.

"Breaking: #EricBolling Out At Fox News","The woman pictured above (SEE MORE BELOW) is a serial accuser of sexual harassment against several men. She gives women a bad name. Notice that Eric Bolling allegedly did something to harass the woman.Eric billing was NEVER found guilty anything but the whispers were enough to bury him. He was one of the best anchors on Fox with his bold style. He supported and defended President Trump throughout the 2016 campaign. We believe he was a great asset to Fox News and see this as a trend of accusations against men the left wants to see taken down. This is a great loss for true conservatives and for Fox News. another reason NOT to watch as the network slides to the left a little more every day Variety reported:Fox News will part ways with host Eric Bolling, a host and contributor whose on-air presence at the 21st Century Fox-owned network had been growing in recent months, after allegations surfaced that he had harassed colleagues there, the network confirmed Friday. Fox News Channel is canceling  The Specialists,  and Eric Bolling and Fox have agreed to part ways amicably,  the network said in a statement.  We thank Eric for his ten years of service to our loyal viewers and wish him the best of luck.  A Huffington Post report had disclosed allegations that Bolling had sent lewd messages to colleagues via smartphone.Bolling, a former commodities trader and best-selling author, had been a longtime co-host of  The Five,  and more recently helped launch a new late-afternoon show,  The Fox News Specialists.  He also anchors the Fox News program  Cashin  In.  Fox News intends to keep Bolling s co-hosts, Eboni Williams and Kat Timpf, as contributors. The show will be replaced at 5 p.m. eastern with an hour of news coverage for the foreseeable future, with rotating anchors holding down the slot.IN CASE YOU DIDN T KNOW: Yesterday, Fox News announced that they were suspending Eric Bolling after accusations that the popular host sent lewd photos to at least three female coworkers   two at Fox Business and one at Fox News. Many believe the accusations against Eric Bolling are just more lies in a series of false sexual misconduct allegations levied against Fox News  top personalities, like Bill O Reilly and the now deceased Roger Ailes. The woman who attempted to smear Fox News host Sean Hannity quickly dropped her accusations when Hannity took off the gloves announced he would fight accuser Debbie Schulssel with  some of the finest and toughest lawyers in the country  after she accused the Fox News host of sexually propositioning her as allegations of sexual harassment continue to roil the network.Philly.com   Suspended Fox News host Eric Bolling s first public accuser is a major left-wing activist who held a protest sign at President Trump s inauguration accusing the president of being a rapist.Caroline Heldman, an Occidental College professor who appeared on Fox News, reportedly  filed a sexual harassment complaint just hours before Fox News announced O Reilly s departure,  according to People magazine.Now, she is back to accuse Eric Bolling, a major Trump supporter at the network. Here is Philly.com s report:Hours after Fox News announced it was suspending Bolling, Caroline Heldman, a politics professor at Occidental College and frequent guest on the network from 2008 to 2011, claimed the Fox News host made an unspecified number of unsolicited sexual advances to her. [Bolling] said he wanted to fly me out to New York for in-studio hits and to have  fun.  He asked me to have meals with him on several occasions, but I found excuses not to go,  Heldman wrote in a lengthy Facebook post.  Once, he took me up to his office in New York, showed me his baseball jerseys, and in the brief time I was there, let me know that his office was his favorite place to have sex.

"END OF FOX NEWS MONOPOLY? LIBERAL Murdoch Sons Who Fired Bill OReilly and Roger Ailes, Suspended Eric Bolling, Are About To Get Some SERIOUS Competition","The wife of Fox News co-owner James Murdoch, made no secret of her dislike for Steve Bannon back in April of 2017: Enough of President Bannon. President Jarvanka preferable.  Kathryn Murdoch (@KathrynAMurdoch) April 5, 2017Are the Murdoch family about to be sorry they ever wished for Steve Bannon to be fired or to resign from his position? According to Axios: Steve Bannon is about to becoe a very big threat to the Murdoch Brothers conservative-leaning network news monopoly.Unshaven and working from home in cargo shorts as he moves into  Bannon the Barbarian  mode, Steve Bannon is thinking bigger than Breitbart.Axios  Jonathan Swan hears Bannon has told friends he sees a massive opening to the right of Fox News, raising the possibility that he s going to start a network.Bannon s friends are speculating about whether it will be a standalone TV network, or online streaming only. Before his death in May, Roger Ailes had sent word to Bannon that he wanted to start a channel together. Bannon loved the idea: He believes Fox is heading in a squishy, globalist direction as the Murdoch sons assume more power. Now he has the means, motive and opportunity: His chief financial backer, Long Island hedge fund billionaire Bob Mercer, is ready to invest big in what s coming next, including a huge overseas expansion of Breitbart News. On Day 1, Bannon declared he s taking his West Wing infighting to the outside, telling Bloomberg Businessweek s Josh Green that he s  going to war for Trump against his opponents   on Capitol Hill, in the media, and in corporate America. The reality is that Bannon will go nuclear on former colleagues he calls  West Wing Democrats : economic adviser Gary Cohn, Jared and Ivanka ( Javanka,  as he calls them) and Deputy National Security Adviser Dina Powell.The revved-up Breitbart operation is also likely to target Speaker Ryan, as it did before Trump.Why it matters: The country s national political conversation is about to get even uglier, if you can imagine. It s going to be dark, and toxic, with a fight on the right that may be more bitter and personal than hostilities between Republicans and Democrats.Will Steve Bannon be more useful to the conservative movement on the outside? Will he use his experiences in the White House and his vast knowledge in the world of conservative media to build a media empire that could crush the Murdoch s FOX News network? Many Americans will be wondering Will Bannon hire Bill O Reilly, the one man who kept Fox News at the top of the ratings for over a decade? President Trump wished Steve Bannon well in his return to Breitbart News. Is it possible Trump knew of Bannon s plans to build a right-leaning media empire that could take down the leftist fake news monopoly we currently see in America?100 Percent FED UP  With the liberal sons of Rupert Murdoch now firmly at the helm of what once was a conservative-leaning alternative to leftist cable news shows like CNN, MSNBC and the mainstream media news outlets, there is a very good chance Americans are witnessing the end of a significant era where FOX News ruled the ratings and liberal-run propaganda networks only dreamed of the kind of revenue they were pulling down.It is difficult to exaggerate the significance of Fox News  sacking of Bill O Reilly.Not only was he the single most dominant public figure in America s vast conservative media environment, his removal signals the growing power of James and Lachlan Murdoch in the world s most powerful media empire, their father Rupert Murdoch s 21st Century Fox.O Reilly was dismissed overnight following allegations of sexual harassment by at least six women. It has been reported that Lachlan s wife Sarah Murdoch helped influence the decision. Last year the former Fox News creator, Roger Ailes, was sacked in similar circumstances, going on to advise Donald Trump s presidential campaign.Murdoch s support for Trump distinguishes him from some of his children, including James, who told more than one friend of his dismay that his father was backing the Trump candidacy. James s wife, Kathryn, backed Hillary Clinton during the campaign and has been a vocal critic of the new president on Twitter. In September Kathryn tweeted:  A vote for Trump is a vote for climate catastrophe , while on the night of the president s stunning election victory she wrote:  I can t believe this is happening. I am so ashamed. James and Kathryn are committed environmentalists: she is on the board of the Environmental Defense Fund, which a Fox News report recently labelled a  leftwing group , while James wrote in The Washington Post in 2009 that  conservation-minded conservatives  were  missing in the heated partisanship of today s politics .   Financial TimesJames Murdoch s wife works for the Clinton Climate Initiative.

Instead of protecting them, these two brave men, Officer Matthew Baxter and Sergeant Sam Howard were ambushed and murdered by the cowards police believe dialed 911 for help.On the other side of the nation, at almost the same time that two innocent police officers were being murdered, brave Boston police officers and Massachusetts State Police were defending 50 pro-free speech Americans, who were surrounded by 30,000 hateful and violent protesters who were threatening American citizens for daring to take a stand for the First Amendment. The pro free-speech Americans had to be carted away in by police in wagons, as violent leftists waited for them to exit the Boston Commons area where they gathered with American flags and peacefully spoke to one another about the importance of free speech in America.Here s a picture of some of the  White Supremacists  defending free-speech in Boston today:https://twitter.com/TruthinGov2016/status/898987969373011969Watch CNN totally lie to their viewers, as they twist the narrative of the FREE SPEECH rally, calling it an  Alt-Right  rally:#BlackLivesMatter organized march started in Boston against racism & Alt-light rally at #BostonCommon & in solidarity w #Charlottesville. pic.twitter.com/hEljI0lyxG  Sara Sidner (@sarasidnerCNN) August 19, 2017Brave Boston police officers were deployed to keep the peace.  Keeping 30,000 angry leftists away from 50 peaceful Americans is  no easy task when you have people on the left who are itching for a fight. Their fight is not just with Americans who want to protect our First Amendment Right to free speech, it s also with the cops. Former GOP presidential candidates like Mitt Romney, John McCain and Marco Rubio took to social media to trash President Trump for not embracing the violent left (the same groups of leftist agitators who were in Charlottesville that are now in Boston). What these sore losers have clearly forgotten is how Barack Obama and his administrations embraced the war on our law enforcement. What these clowns don t see is that cops being murdered or innocent Americans being beaten bloody because they don t hold the same leftist views is never going to end, unless we have a leader who is willing to call them out.Watch this large group surround and threaten one young man who was all by himself because he was wearing a Trump hat. Can anyone imagine this happening to anyone wearing an Obama hat while he was president? How about you Mitt Romney? Are you okay with this?Guy wearing @realDonaldTrump red cap quickly surrounded, people yelling "shame.""

Over 20 years later, his efforts, along with those of every president succeeding him, have been futile.Every president since Clinton has allowed North Korea s nuclear ambitions to go unchecked. Perhaps now that North Korea allegedly has the capability of striking our mainland, America really needs is a president who is willing to stand up to North Korea s brutal dictator and let him know he s not playing with Barack Obama anymore.Will President Trump be the one to finally put an end to North Korea s threatening rhetoric by refusing to ignore Kim Jong Un s threats?North Korea now has an intercontinental ballistic missile that can range most of the continental U.S., and a new Defense Intelligence Agency assessment suggests that North Korea has successfully miniaturized nuclear warheads for its missiles.In the early 1990s, Clinton faced a growing nuclear threat from North Korea, but he ultimately chose diplomacy and deals over the application of military force. I was determined to prevent North Korea from developing a nuclear arsenal, even at the risk of war,  Clinton wrote in his memoirs.

Here is Philly.com s report:Hours after Fox News announced it was suspending Bolling, Caroline Heldman, a politics professor at Occidental College and frequent guest on the network from 2008 to 2011, claimed the Fox News host made an unspecified number of unsolicited sexual advances to her.

"BOOM! ACTOR JAMES WOODS Has Hilarious Response To Angry Feminist MSNBC Hosts Criticism Of Ivankas Girly Dress","The hate for the Trump family by the defeated liberal press is visceral MSNBC political analyst Joan Walsh, a self-proclaimed feminist, questioned what  message  Ivanka Trump was trying to send at the G20 Summit by wearing a pink  girly  dress with bows.Walsh suggested that the dress Trump chose when sitting in for her father at the summit made her look like  property  and undermined her own value. I don t mean to sound sexist, it can be dangerous to comment on what women wear, but the fact that she sat in for her father in a dress that was so incredibly ornamental was such a contradiction,  Walsh said.  In patriarchal, authoritarian societies, daughters have great value. They are property. I think it s really pretty frightening,  she continued.  It s a pink dress with big bows on the elbows that s not a dress that s made for work. MSNBC host Thomas Roberts pushed back and asked if Walsh was suggesting that women can not dress in a feminine manner and be taken seriously. You can be a feminist and be girly, we all have our girly days, but showing up, taking your father s seat in a pink dress with big bows on the sleeves is a really interesting message,  Walsh argued.

RAND PAUL, NEWT GINGRICH RIP OBAMAS National Security Advisor, Benghazi Video Liar, Susan Rice For ABRUPTLY Backing Out Of House Testimony [VIDEO]","Susan Rice will not visit Capitol Hill today for a meeting with the House committee probing allegations she  unmasked  President Trump associates in Russian meddling probes.Hmmm If Democrats really wanted to get to the bottom of their  Trump-Russia collusion  witch-hunt, it would certainly make sense that Rice would be jumping at the opportunity to testify at the House hearings.Rice had been expected to face tough questions on her role in the matter while serving as then-President Barack Obama s national security adviser. Trump alleges Rice may have committed a crime by asking government analysts to disclose the names of his associates documented in intelligence reports.Fox News was initially told Rice would be giving closed-door testimony Tuesday before the Republican-led House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.But that session has apparently been postponed.The panel is leading one of several investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 White House race, which have engulfed the Trump administration and evolved to include questions about whether anybody on Trump s campaign team colluded with the Kremlin to defeat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan last week told Fox News that he wants Rice to answer the basic question:  Did you unmask the names and if so why? He also argued that Americans indeed deserve to know the truth about the Trump associates but they also want answers from high-ranking Obama administration officials who may have misled Americans on critical matters   including Rice, as U.S. ambassador to the U.N., saying the fatal 2012 Benghazi terror attacks were largely  sparked  by an anti-Muslim video. The American people want to get the truth on all of these issues,  said Jordan. He also raised concerns about how Obama Attorney General Loretta Lynch handled the Clinton email investigation and whether James Comey exposed classified information in an apparent effort to retaliate against Trump firing him as FBI director.Rice has denied that she did anything inappropriate, saying she was authorized as Obama s national security adviser to seek the identities of people whose names were redacted from intelligence reports.And she has suggested that her race and gender may be playing a role in the controversy, in a recent New York Magazine interview.   Fox NewsIt would be more shocking to the American people if Rice didn t use her race and gender as an excuse for committing heinous crimes against American citizens. It s the only card left in the deck for a cheating, lying and deceitful administration with their backs firmly against the wall Fox News legal anchor Gregg Jarrett said Rice is lying.

"REEBOK JOINS The Lefts War Against President Trump&Berates Him On Twitter For Complimenting French President Macrons Wife","Brigitte Macron is 24 years older than her husband. She is 64-years old and is in great shape for a woman of her age. As a female, who is younger than Mrs. Macron, I would be thrilled if the most powerful man in the world shook my hand and offered me a sincere compliment about what  great shape  I was in. Mrs. Macron didn t likely wake up one morning and decide she wanted to be a stunning 64-year old woman. She likely had to work at it. Being a 64-year old woman who is married to a charismatic 39-year old man, who is also the newly elected leader of France is probably not that easy. She likely has a rigorous workout schedule, and if she is like most women, she appreciates it when someone notices how hard she works to stay in  great shape.  It is possible that Macron has simply been gifted with great genes and does nothing at all to stay in  great shape , but either way, a compliment about her appearance was likely appreciated by the 64-year old stunner. The Daily Mail ran a wildly popular article in May about Brigitte Macron titled:How DOES Macron s wife defy her age? Experts claim hair extensions, veneers, designer style and some very subtle cosmetic surgery keep Brigitte Trogneux, 64, looking so youthfulHmmm We don t remember the outrage from the media over the Daily Mail article that explored every possibility that could explain Macron s age-defying look, that ran just prior to France s election. There will, of course, always be critics. After all, the compliment didn t just come from any man, it came from the man who was not supposed to defeat the media s candidate, Hillary Clinton.Many on social media have criticized the Macron couple s difference in age. Macron s campaign was very aware that the age difference could be a turn off to some voters, as the media was quick to dispel any thoughts that Brigitte was some sort of  pedophile  or  cougar.  They shared the Macron s unusual story of how Emmanuel Macron fell in love with his wife Brigitte while she was his high school drama teacher. They talked about how he pledged his love to her early on, promising he would come back some day and marry her. (How quickly everyone forgets the criticism Donald Trump got on social media for marrying the much younger Melania.)In case the world hasn t noticed, President Trump doesn t play the same game as other politicians. He s genuine and honest. He says what he feels and most importantly, he says what s in his heart. He s not a career politician, and for that, most of us are grateful. When President Trump greeted Brigitte Macron for the first time, he shook her hand, looked her straight in the eye, and complimented her on how great she looked. Trump simply told her,  You re in such great shape  and then followed it up by telling her she was  beautiful . The media and those on the left went nuts. It wasn t just individuals on social media and leftist journalists who attacked Donald Trump. One major athletic apparel and accessory company took to Twitter to mock our sitting President.For some reason, someone at Reebok thought it would be a good idea to tweet a chart to President Trump to let him know whether or not he should compliment the 64-year old Macron. When did Reebok become the arbiter of free-speech? Who, at Reebok decided it would be a good idea to mock our President on social media?

"BREAKING: Michigan Native KID ROCK Announces Hes Running For US Senate","Kid Rock, aka Robert (Bob) Ritchie, a native of Michigan who was born and raised in my hometown of Romeo, just announced on Twitter that he s running for US Senate. As a kid, I remember frequently sitting across from the Ritchie family in our local Catholic church. Kid Rock is a philanthropist who s done so much to help those in need in the city of Detroit. He s also very passionate about supporting our troops. Ritchie s made several overseas trips to play for our troops, and even donated specially designed homes for disabled veterans. Ritchie (Kid Rock) has not yet announced which party he ll be aligning himself with. He s been a staunch supporter of Republican presidential candidates in the past like Mitt Romney, Ben Carson and after he won the GOP primary, Kid Rock got behind Donald Trump. In 2013, Ritchie told Rolling Stones that he considers himself more of a libertarian. Stay tuned I have had a ton of emails and texts asking me if this website is real  https://t.co/RRVgISDFeq The answer is an absolute YES. pic.twitter.com/uYCUg6mjW1  Kid Rock (@KidRock) July 12, 2017Rock is one of the most prominent right-leaning voices in music, but he s also a somewhat irregular Republican:  I don t like the hardcore views on either side and I m not in bed with anybody,  he told Rolling Stone in 2013.  I d probably be more libertarian, but I m a firm believer you have to pick a side. I can t be playing the middle. If Rock runs as a Republican, he ll be up against Trump s Michigan Campaign Chair, Lena Epstein for the GOP nomination.Lena is a candidate the left will have a very hard time defeating. She s Jewish, she s a Harvard grad, and she s a tough-minded, successful business woman who wasn t afraid to jump in and support Trump from the moment he announced he was running. Rock may have his hands full with the very popular Lena Epstein, who we believe has the ability to defeat the very liberal Democrat Senator Debbie Stabenow.  Rock has the star power, but many will question if he s really got what it takes to run for US Senate.CBS Sunday Morning attempts to find out who badass rocker Kid Rock really is in this interview:And for those who might be saying (or thinking) Kid Rock running for Senate is crazy or ridiculous.

"TEEN VOGUE Publishes Article To Teach Teen Girls How To Have Anal Sex: ANAL 101, for teens, beginners","Two months before the 2016 election, Teen Vogue featured a personal essay by Hillary Clinton, a conversation between Amandla Stenberg and Gloria Steinem, and an interview with Loretta Lynch.In their latest grotesque attempt to make immoral behavior appear to be mainstream for young girls, Teen Vogue asks their young readers. In the article, Gigi Engle suggests that young girls stay away from the internet when it comes to exploring the topic of  anal sex  and instead, rely strictly on Teen Vogue for all of their information. Hmmmm .that s an interesting concept; don t read anything else, just rely on Teen Vogue as your sole source of information. Sounds like indoctrination 101.Here s an excerpt from the article one might expect to find in Penthouse magazine:Teen Vogue   When it comes to your body, it s important that you have the facts. It s not doing your sexual health or self-understanding any favors to keep you in the dark.With that sentiment in mind, we re here to lay it all out for you when it comes to anal sex.Why anal?Anal sex, though often stigmatized and shamed, is a perfectly natural way to engage in sexual activity. People have been having anal sex since the dawn of humanity. Seriously, it s been documented back to the Ancient Greeks and then some. So, if you re a little worried about trying it, or are having trouble understanding the appeal, just know that it isn t weird or gross.In a separate article, Vogue Magazine talks about a makeup manufacturer offering  butt-plugs :OMG https://t.co/Wu0nbw3Wf3  Teen Vogue (@TeenVogue) July 11, 2017Teen Vogue is filled with anti-Trump and anti-Republican propaganda.

At the point where  Julius Caesar,  (who is intentionally made to look like President Trump) is about to be stabbed by a gang of minorities, Loomer rushed the stage and admonished the cast and audience for promoting violence against our current president and against Republicans in general.See video of Rebel Media s Loomer rushing the stage here:Only 3 days ago, an unhinged Democrat opened fire on Republican House members at a baseball practice for a charity game against Democrats Congressmen. Representative Steve Scalise (R-LA) remains in critical condition. Doctors who were in attendance when the married father of 2 arrived at the hospital have now revealed that Scalise was very near to death when he arrived. Democrats like George Soros continue to fund violence against opposing voices, Barack Obama, former AG Loretta Lynch, Hillary Clinton and her running mate Tim Kaine have all advocated for action and/or violence against Trump supporters.  Liberal professors promote hate and disrespect for anyone with opposing political views and have made their classrooms a hostile environment for students who dare to speak up or speak out against their radical views. Hollywood has come unhinged, and there doesn t appear to a line they won t cross when it comes to promoting violence against Americans who openly support President Trump. The left has shown themselves to be the largest collection of bullies and domestic terrorists this nation has ever seen.At about the 4:30 mark in the video, Laura Loomer, who is a fan of theater recites a Shakespeare line,  Violent delights have violent ends.  She then looks into the camera and calls out Hollywood and the left for the violence against Trump supporters and Republicans,  Just like Shakespeare said; If you re delighting in this violence, this normalized political violence against the right, it s going to have a violent end. Loomer goes on to point out how liberals like Kathy Griffin and the CNN network who glorify those who commit or threaten violence are responsible for this violent atmosphere, and that they re no better than ISIS. Loomer points out the comparisons between the actors on the Central Park stage who are  gang stabbing  President Trump:  I just couldn t help but think to myself:  Wow! When you re holding a knife to someone s throat in the play, and joking about chopping someone s throats off, what makes you any better than ISIS?  Jack Posobiac makes a very interesting point at about the gang stabbing of President Trump:  It was like a gang stabbing. All the people stabbing him were minorities.

Eustis was referring to the statement the National Endowment for the Arts issued Monday, after the Public s production of Shakespeare s storied play came under attack from ultraconservative websites and even from one of the sons of President Trump, who questioned whether it was taxpayer-supported. They targeted the production because of the obvious references it draws to the current president and the depiction in the play of the assassination of its Caesar-as-Trump figure, played by Gregg Henry.Donald Trump Jr. tweeted a message asking if the assassination of his father should be funded by taxpayers: No NEA funds have been awarded to support this summer s Shakespeare in the Park production of  Julius Caesar  and there are no NEA funds supporting the New York State Council on the Arts s grant to Public Theater or its performances,  the NEA declared, in what struck many in the arts world as an extraordinary act of disavowal. It came as two high-profile corporate supporters of Shakespeare in the Park, Delta Air Lines and Bank of America, withdrew financial backing, and a third, American Express, said that its contributions go exclusively to the Public s main theater in downtown Manhattan and it did not condone the interpretation staged in Central Park.Instead of recognizing that the theater group had crossed a line that should not have been crossed, Eustis is willing to take a loss at the box office in order to keep the assassination of President Trump on stage in front of thousands of families in Central Park: As for the Public s future in this climate, Eustis said,  This is damaging for us and we definitely lost money, and nobody likes losing money.

"CNN HOSTS PANIC When Congressman, Lawyer Says Feds Need To Investigate Seth Rich Murder During Russia-Trump Collusion Discussion [VIDEO]","Caller-Times: Speaking on CNN Wednesday, the fourth-term congressman refuted a widely believed conclusion that the Russian government interfered with the U.S. presidential election to aid President Donald Trump s campaign and instead indicated a conspiracy theory about a slain Democratic National Committee staffer could be true. My fear is our constant focusing on the Russians is deflecting away for some other things that we need to be investigating,  Farenthold said on the network.  There s still some question as to whether the intrusion of the DNC server was an insider job or whether or not it was the Russians. Later Wednesday, Farenthold elaborated on his opinion of how the investigation should be handled in a phone interview with the Caller-Times. The death should be investigated in the same manner Russian interference has been reviewed, he said. That should be a part of the ongoing investigation into alleged Russian interference in the election, because that s an alternative theory that deserves being looked at,  Farenthold said.Watch how quickly CNN hosts John Berman and Poppy Harlow attack Congressman Farenthold when he even suggests there s something suspicious about the supposed  robbery gone bad  (where no valuables were stolen) that lead to the murder of DNC staffer Seth Rich.

Farenthold said the Russian conclusion is premature until there s a review of Democratic committee s computer system by an independent investigator.

Hannity even asked Dotcom to appear on his show, hoping that he would reveal evidence that Seth Rich was the person who sent the DNC emails to Wikileaks, and NOT the Russians.Here was the first email from Kim Dotcom where he claims to have known Seth Rich and that Rich was the Wikileaks source.

"DETECTIVE ON SETH RICH Murder Mystery Drops Shocking News [Video]","Rod Wheeler was on Hannity last night with startling information on the Seth Rich murder mystery. He spoke about the mystery of why they can t locate the computer Rich used. They went on to discuss clues in the case that point to collusion between the DC police and the DNC. The most shocking information comes at the 4:20 mark when Wheeler says this:Rod Wheeler:  Here s one other thing that is going to be startling I m just gonna say this right now. I reached out to the police department way back in March when the family first hired me right..to get involved. I didn t hear anything from the police department for 2-3 days.Guess what I learned yesterday from the family of Seth Rich? The police department did not call me back because someone, a high ranking official at the DNC check this out a high ranking official at the DNC when I called the police department, they got that information and called the Rich family wanting to know, why was I snooping around? The plot thickens in this case. Will we finally find the murderer of this young man and who is behind it?IN CASE YOU HAVEN T SEEN UPDATES ON THIS CASE:CONFIRMED BOMBSHELL: SETH RICH Sent Over 44,000 DNC Emails To Journalist, Best Friend Of Wikileaks Founder DC Police Officer Claims They Were Told To  Stand Down  On Case [VIDEO]Wow! The private investigator hired by the Rich family to look into the death of 27-year old murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich just revealed some stunning evidence. It s been confirmed that over 44,000 emails and over 17,000 attachments were sent to the now deceased investigative journalist and best friend of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. Now that this new information has been made available to the public, will the media be asking Hillary or the DNC any questions about their involvement in Rich s death? Will the DOJ be opening an investigation into his death in light of this new stunning evidence? What about the alleged Russian hack of the DNC emails that the media tried to tie to President Trump?Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich s death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich s laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death.Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich s murder. He said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation. The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,  said Wheeler.  They haven t been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both. When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said,  Absolutely. Yeah. That s confirmed. Wheeler also told us,  I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said,  Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can t share any information with you.  Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I don t think it comes from the chief s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor s office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday].The Democratic National Committee staffer who was gunned down on July 10 on a Washington, D.C., street just steps from his home had leaked thousands of internal emails to WikiLeaks, law enforcement sources told Fox News.A federal investigator who reviewed an FBI forensic report detailing the contents of DNC staffer Seth Rich s computer generated within 96 hours after his murder, said Rich made contact with WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time.  FOX5DCHere is the tweet announcing the death of Gavin MacFayden only weeks before the U.S. presidential election:Gavin Macfadyen was mentor to Assange (and his closest friend in London), to WikiLeaks' Sarah Harrison, Joseph Farrell and many others.  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 23, 2016 I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,  the federal investigator told Fox News, confirming the MacFadyen connection. He said the emails are in possession of the FBI, while the stalled case is in the hands of the Washington Police Department.The revelation is consistent with the findings of Rod Wheeler, a former DC homicide detective and Fox News contributor and whose private investigation firm was hired by Rich s family to probe the case. Rich was shot from behind in the wee hours, but was not robbed. My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,  Wheeler said.  I do believe that the answers to who murdered Seth Rich sits on his computer on a shelf at the DC police or FBI headquarters. The federal investigator, who requested anonymity, said 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments between Democratic National Committee leaders, spanning from January 2015 through late May 2016, were transferred from Rich to MacFadyen before May 21.   FOX NewsWe reported on this story extensively. Here are some of our stunning findings over the past 10 months. It s pretty stunning that it took so long to find out about the e-mails on Rich s laptop: Conspiracy theories have been surrounding the murder of Seth Rich.

"HOW PAUL RYAN JUST Made A Mockery Of Trumps Promise To Protect Blue-Collar Jobs From Foreign Workers","The bipartisan congressional language creates a headache for Trump and his deputies because it flips the politically difficult problem from Congress to the Department of Homeland Security of deciding whether to provide extra wage-cutting H-2B contract workers to companies or else to improve job opportunities for Trump s blue-collar voters.The new rule helps business groups offset rising pressure for wage increases, just 18 months before the mid-term elections when voters will vet the success or not of Trump s  Buy American, Hire American  policies.The H-2B language was hidden deep in the draft 2017 supplemental budget   which is to face House and Senate votes this week   and it surprised opponents of the legislation. In December 2016, Ryan had agreed to trim the program when the partial 2017 budget deal was announced just one month after blue-collar voters backed Donald Trump s campaign promise of a low-immigration, high-wage national economic policy.Apparently nothing is going to change, as long as Speaker Ryan remains at the helm.

"ERIC TRUMP REMOVES ANY DOUBT About International Business Deals With HUGE Announcement: Its The Right Thing To Do [VIDEO]","Eric Trump, in his first interview since his father Donald Trump was elected president, said on Sunday the Trump Organization plans to stop development of real estate projects overseas. In light of politics, we ve said  hey, listen, we re not going to expand anymore internationally. We re not going to do any new international projects.  And that was a big piece of what we did,  Trump, who is executive vice president of the organization, told Maria Bartiromo in an exclusive sitdown on  Sunday Morning Futures. Eric, along with older siblings Don Jr. and Ivanka, all have or have held positions within the family business prior to their father winning the presidential election. Once President Trump took office, he pledged to separate private interests from public policy. One way the president did this was by putting his holdings in a trust, managed by his sons and another executive from the company.Though no longer growing internationally for the time being, Trump explained how he finds the next growth spot in the real estate market, saying part of it is  gut  and  intuition. You see places that are reducing taxes, they re trying to incentivize businesses to come in. Those are always the places that do immensely well,  Trump said, citing Florida as a key example."It's the right thing to do."" -Eric Trump announces Trump Organization will stop expanding overseas pic.twitter.com/BnN2TJYtrO  FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) March 20"," 2017 They have low taxes"," they ve got an incredible quality of life.

It doesn t fit their agenda, as it exposes the Democrat Party for who they ve become under the leadership of Barack Obama and his new permanent house-guest Valerie Jarrett. Jarrett has reportedly moved in the with Obama s, to what is being called the  nerve center  to help him organize this type of activity that is being identified as the  #resistance  movement against President Trump.This picture shows how far the Left has strayed since the days of Martin Luther King Jr. s fight for civil rights and  free speech : Take a good darn look at these two photos. pic.twitter.com/jnIrCs29Mj  Kathy Zhu (@PoliticalKathy) March 5, 2017True to form, Democrats made it clear that they would not allow the free speech of Trump supporters to take place without a fight.#March4Trump #berkeley irony: "anti fascists"" burning a sign that literally said Free Speech pic.twitter.com/rKuJtDGF1v  Jason Belich   (@JasonBelich) March 5"," 2017As expected"," Trump supporters were beaten"

"RACIST LIBERAL REPORTER Arrested In Connection With 8 Jewish Community Center Bomb Threats&Blames Nasty/Racist White Girl [VIDEO]","The media and the Democrat Party has been coming down pretty hard on President Trump for not doing enough to call out the rise of hateful anti-semitism, as though Trump has a direct line to the anti-semites. Well, as it turns out, the first person to be arrested for his involvement in a string of bomb threats that were made to Jewish Community Centers is an openly racist, leftist journalist. Let that sink in. When 31 year old disgraced journalist Juan Thompson was arrested in connection with making threats against eight Jewish Community Centers, he immediately took to Twitter (where his feed is filled with hateful, racist views) to blame a white former girlfriend for framing you so you d be  raped in jail what else? Juan Thompson, of Missouri, is accused of making the threats as part of an extensive cyber-stalking  campaign  against his ex-girlfriend to  harass and intimidate  her, the U.S. Attorney s Office for the Southern District of New York announced on March 3.Thompson was fired by The Intercept last February after he was accused of fabricating sources in a story about the Charleston church shooting.Here s what you need to know.1. During One Threat, Thompson Claimed There Were Bombs in a Middle School & There Was Going to be a  Jewish Newtown In the now-retracted article, Thompson had claimed that  Scott Roof  had speculated during a phone conversation that Dylann Roof may been driven to murder nine black churchgoers at a Charleston, South Carolina church because  he kind of went over the edge when a girl he liked starting dating a black guy two years back.  Thompson s report was picked up by dozens of other news outlets.Thompson was hired by The Intercept s founding editor-in-chief, John Cook, in November 2014. Reed replaced Cook, a former editor of Gawker.com and the current executive editor of Gawker Media, in December 2014. Prior to The Intercept, Thompson had reported in Chicago for DNAInfo and interned at the local NPR affiliate, WBEZ.*On Twitter, Thompson claimed that the threats were made by his ex-girlfriend, the FBI said in court documents.The FBI has been investigating more than 100 bomb threats made to Jewish Community Centers, schools and the Anti-Defamation League, along with other Jewish organizations, since early January. There have been at least five waves of attacks, with multiple threats coming on the same day.Police do not believe Thompson is the main suspect behind the majority of the threats, ABC News reports. Police sources told ABC News that Thompson appears to have taken advantage of national news coverage of the threats to continue his ongoing harassment against his ex-girlfriend in revenge for her breaking up with him.

Chobani has filled 30 percent of its 600 positions at the world s largest Yogurt plant in Twin Falls, Idaho, with refugees resettled in America through a U.S. State Department program carried out in cooperation with the United Nations.Ann Corcoran, author of the Refugee Resettlement Watch blog, said the potential conflict of interest is disturbing and should be questioned by Twin Falls residents. Twin Falls is really a microcosm of what we find going on in so many of the refugee communities across the U.S., where you have people moving in and out of government and the Chamber of Commerce with a vested interest in making sure a meatpacking plant or some other industry has continuous access to refugee labor,  said Corcoran.  Only in this case we have a blatant example of conflicts of interest by an elected official who is also the head of the Chamber enticing companies to come in and make use of the steady influx of cheap, overseas labor. These are jobs that Americans would be happy to fill but they are forced to compete now with someone from Sudan or Iraq who is used to working for a dollar a week. The local Muslim community in Twin Falls grew out of its mosque and built a new, much larger house of worship last year.Here s Chobani CEO s response to Trump s moratorium on refugees from 7 countries:  This is very personal for me,  Ulukaya wrote in internal memo to his staff that was obtained by CNN.  As an immigrant who came to this country looking for opportunity, it s very difficult to think about and imagine what millions of people around the world must be feeling right now.

These employees and customers are critical to our success and they are our friends and partners,  he wrote, adding that GE would  stand with them  and try to find a balance between security and  movement of law abiding people.  Immelt was one of 28 business leaders named to a council to advise Trump on manufacturing growth.Trip Advisor CEO Stephen Kaufer Trip Advisor s (TRIP) CEO wrote in a Linkedin post that Trump s immigration ban is  not only heartless and discriminatory, but also against the principles that make our country great.  Kaufer also said in a tweet that  We need to do more, not less, to help refugees,  and said the action was  wrong on humanitarian grounds, legal grounds, and won t make us  safer.'  In a separate tweet, he called out Republican lawmakers:  You can t sit this one out. We need to do more, not less, to help refugees.

"BOOM! FOX NEWS LEFTIST CHRIS WALLACE Attempts Trump Smear Over Inauguration Crowd Size&FOX News Brit Hume Backs Up Trump On Fake News Story [VIDEO]","The AP, CNN, People Magazine and other mainstream media, fake news outlets used pictures of the crowds at Obama s inauguration to compare to the crowd s at Trump s inauguration. The only problem is, the picture they used for Trump s inauguration crowd was taken before Trump s actual speech, where the crowds were much larger.Of course, there was never a comparison between Obama and George W. Bush s inauguration crowds, because instead of the full-blown media assassination attempt we see against President Trump, the post-inauguration media coverage was more like an all out effort to canonize Barack Obama by our sycophant media.The media completely ignored the fact that threats of violence were being made by Soros funded groups against Trump supporters since the day after the election. They ignored the open threats made against anyone who dared to attend Trump s inauguration.Anti-Trump rioters made good on their threats. They used human chains to lock visitors out of certain areas including check points where Trump supporters had to pass through in order to get to the inauguration and to the parade.Watch this husband and wife, as they are split up by human barricades. The husband manages to break through the barricade but the wife is trapped and unable to join him.

Rioters wearing black ski masks and carrying sledge hammers they used to bust out windows of banks and vehicles were roaming the streets as well.None of these threats existed prior to or during Obama s inauguration. It s pretty safe to say that angry Democrats and anarchists roaming the streets looking for trouble didn t make for the most family friendly environment. Many Trump supporters admitted they wouldn t attend the inauguration because they feared violence against them and their children. But the media just glossed over the fear factor created by the Left, and chalked it up to Trump s sudden (according to fake polls)  unpopularity. Here are the propaganda photos used by the media to discredit Trump.Comparing the crowds at Donald Trump s and Barack Obama s inaugurations https://t.co/YysDewDB9N pic.twitter.com/myrXutzMpH  NYT Politics (@nytpolitics) January 21, 2017For the record, here is an actual picture that was taken during Trump s inaugural speech. The mall appears to be jam packed with Trump supporters:Chris Wallace jumped on the mainstream media train this morning and attempted to discredit Trump and his Press Secretary Sean Spicer. Chris Wallace asked to have the picture comparing Trump and Obama s crowds up on the screen for the viewers to see before confronting  Reince Priebus. Priebus responded,  You re also not saying that that picture was taken before he even began speaking.  Chris Wallace freaks, and asks to have the picture put back up again (which of course doesn t change what Priebus just said).Watch:Fox News  Senior Political Analyst, who also attended the inauguration, tells a much different story than the one Wallace was trying to paint. Perhaps Wallace should have consulted with Hume, since they both work for the same network. Perhaps he should have asked about how the violent protesters affected the number of people who were actually able to make it to the inauguration. To be sure, Brit Hume was no cheerleader for Donald Trump leading up to the election, but at least he had the integrity to tell the truth about the deceitful media s attempt to prove Trump supporters have somehow magically deserted him.I was in the building at the bottom of picture on right yesterday.

Her record label, Columbia, refused to let her record the song under their name, so they granted her a one-session contractual release that gave Holiday clearance to independently record the track.Later that year, the album featuring  Strange Fruit  sold a million copies, becoming Holiday s biggest-selling record at the time. In 1978, the single was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.  Last month, The Beach Boys told CNN that the group has been contacted about performing, but that  no decision has been made at this point as to how or whether they will participate.

BLM Supporter, Dem Congressman Hangs COP-HATING, Race-Baiting Art-Work In U.S. Capitol Building","A piece of art depicting cops as animals that are killing minorities that has no business hanging in our US Capitol building Artistic expression, or one congressman s political statement masquerading as  student art? A very offensive depiction of police hands in the U.S. Capitol complex, and Missouri Rep. William Lacy Clay is drawing heat for placing it there.For several months the painting, called  Untitled #1,  has hung in the House building connecting hall, depicting police as animals seemingly engaged in the act of brutalizing minorities.  BPRIn February 2015, Democratic Congressman Clay suggested that prosecutors are responsible for fixing outcome of racially charged cases that involve cops when he claimed that in Ferguson and in Garner s death  we saw an all-too-familiar pattern of local prosecutors who work hand-in-hand with police every day, essentially prewiring the grand jury process to produce a known outcome. In a released statement, Clay said,  Members of Congress support student art competitions in our districts but we do not select the young artists and we do not judge the artwork. I had no role in selecting the winner of this student art competition and I would never attempt to approve or disapprove artistic expression. The U.S. Capitol is a symbol of freedom, not censorship. The young artist chose his own subject and the painting will not be removed. He also told the St. Louis Post Dispatch that the painting was  the most creative expression that I ve witnessed in the last 16 years.

Even after our dishonest media was caught working behind the scenes with Crooked Hillary, her campaign and the DNC, they still came at Trump with a shameless vengeance like we ve never seen. What the media didn t understand however, was that every time we saw Trump alone in the ring against a mob of unruly leftist  journalists  fighting back with everything he had, it only strengthened our resolve.In Trump, Americans saw something that s been missing from our politicians for decades, we saw someone who was actually willing o fight for our nation on our behalf. We saw someone who wasn t going to concede to political correctness, or to give our lying media respect they didn t deserve. Every time he called them out for their dishonesty, Americans cheered.

Obama has been very clear about his open alliance with Black Lives Matter terrorists and professional race baiters for hire. Ever since the death of thug Trayvon Martin, when Obama began his first strategy meetings with Al Sharpton and his former AG, racist Eric Holder, he s been shamelessly holding closed-door meetings at our White House. His meetings have been met with criticism by many Americans for hosting unsavory characters, like the guy wearing a tracking device on his ankle for kidnapping and rappers who threaten to harm fellow Americans if the election doesn t go their way at our White House. All the while, Obama has been subtly encouraging the masses to keep up the fight against law enforcement and to not let up on the oppressive white man. These violent protests are NOT spontaneous. They are happening as a result of a well planned, highly strategized and well-funded group of hard core leftists, who will stop at nothing to ensure their radical agenda is not upended by the shocking rise of the unafraid Donald Trump.YThis anti-Trump mob began their organized disruptions last night in San Jose, CA.

You can t blame these blacktivists for using  white guilt  as a weapon to game the system, as a means to gain an advantage over everyone else (Hispanics and Asians included). The real question is, when is someone going to be brave enough to stand up and say  enough of this manufactured hate! The ad for Gap s latest collaboration with Ellen DeGeneres is awash with pleasing blue hues, from the kid models  navy outfits to the talk show host s denim jacket.But the shades that really caught people s attention were on the children s skin. The commercial s stars were three white girls and a black girl.https://youtu.be/gdxXBqdfWMEThat, in itself, wasn t a problem. In the days following the campaign s launch last week, what drew ire from commentators online was the seeming passivity of the African American girl. While the other girls eagerly fielded DeGeneres s questions about their troupe  Le Petite Cirque,  she sat silent. While the white girls were highlighted performing solo acrobatic tricks, she seemed to appear only in reference to the others   balancing on someone s knees or with her arm wrapped around someone s waist.At least, this was the interpretation of those who were angered by the ad. And they were angered, most of all, by a photograph that showed the white girls standing in all manner of complex poses while the black girl s arms dangled idly at her sides, her head a cushion upon which another white girl rested an elbow.This imagery sparked the usual chain of reactions online. Those who were offended minced no words in expressing their outrage, and they were promptly reprimanded by those who thought they were overreacting.So @Gap decides to use the only Black girl in this campaign as a prop ..we see you! pic.twitter.com/widB8Axk5U    ArtsySneakerGirl (@BamaIntrovert) April 3, 2016That ad certainly isn't suggesting that *black* girls "can do anything"," @GapKids.

"WHEN DID ROMNEY BECOME The Godfather Of The GOP&And Why Didnt He Fight This Hard Against Obama? [VIDEO]","It s difficult to look at Romney coming out against Trump and not wonder if there are a few  sour grapes?   Romney s timing for questioning Trump s character is very interesting, considering his former deputy campaign manager, Katie Packer was the key figure behind the anti-Trump super-PAC,  Our Principles created for the sole purpose of taking down Trump that just announced yesterday that they ve given up on their efforts. Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney stated that Republican presidential candidates Donald Trump, Texas Senator Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), and Florida Senator Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) ought to release their taxes for  the last two years that have already been filed  and that there s  good reason to believe that there s a bombshell in Donald Trump s taxes  on Wednesday s  Your World with Neil Cavuto  on the Fox News Channel.He added,  I think there s no question but that Donald Trump has the clearest path to become the Republican nominee. I think for the other people still in the race, their path is becoming a slimmer and slimmer opening, and they re having a difficult time communicating to their supporters just how they could become the nominee. It s not impossible. I think it s very difficult for any one of the non-Donald Trump contenders to be able to be a real threat, unless perhaps the field narrows.Romney then said, when asked about his lack of an endorsement for anyone so far,  Well, frankly, I d like to see a number of things from the candidates, not just their positions on issues in some detail, and some candidates are more thorough in laying out what they re going to do than others, but I d also like to see their back taxes. I d like to see where they filed their taxes in the last several years. I m not talking about their taxes this year. I m talking about the taxes that have already been filed with the IRS. And Donald Trump and Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz have [not] shown us their back taxes. Romney further stated that  the last two years that have already been filed  would  give us a real sense of whether these people are on the up and up, and whether they ve been telling us things about themselves that are true or not.  He then said,  I think we have good reason to believe that there s a bombshell in Donald Trump s taxes. He explained,  I think there s something there, either he s not as anywhere near as wealthy as he says he is, or he hasn t been paying the kind of taxes we would expect him to pay, or perhaps he hasn t been giving money to the vets, or to the disabled, like he s been telling us he s been doing. And I think that s   the reason that I think there s a bombshell in there, is because every time he s asked about his taxes, he dodges and delays and says, well, we re working on it. Hey, we re not talking about the taxes that are coming due this year. Of course they re working on those. They won t be ready for months. We re talking about taxes already filed, back taxes. And my back taxes, when I ran in 2012, my back taxes, I put out in January of 2012. We re now in late February and we still haven t seen either Donald Trump s, or Marco Rubio s, or Ted Cruz s taxes. And frankly the voters have a right to see those tax returns before they decide who our nominee ought to be. Trump s response to Romney s accusation:Romney said that the scrutiny over his taxes when he ran back in 2012 is  a good reason for getting these things out before the voters make their choices to who our nominee will be.  He continued,  I put my taxes out in January of 2012, and that gave people a chance to digest it, and decide whether I was going to be the nominee or not. And if in fact Donald Trump s taxes, or Marco Rubio s, or Ted Cruz s, have some real problems in there, let s get them out there and see them. But I think it s pretty clear that, given Donald Trump s dodging and weaving and delay, I think the last time he was asked about his taxes he said, well, it s going to be a month. Look, people have a right to know if there s a problem in those taxes before they decide. Romney concluded,  You know, Donald Trump has said he s the best in the country for the disabled veterans, and for the disabled generally. Well, if his taxes show that he hasn t made any contributions to the disabled veterans, or to the disabled generally, that would be a big issue. So   and I m not saying that s the case. I have no evidence of that. But I m just saying there are things that could be issues, and when people decide they don t want to give you their taxes, it s usually because there s something they don t want you to see. Via:BreitbartPosted by Donald J. Trump on Thursday, 25 February 2016 Does Romney s concern over Trump and his taxes have anything to do with Trump s go it alone attitude? Or perhaps The Donald has a point?.@MittRomney can only speak negatively about my presidential chances because I have been openly hard on his terrible "choke"" loss to Obama!  Donald J.

"HARD-CORE, CONSERVATIVE, Street Artist, Sabo Videotapes Visit From Secret Service&Who Is This Guy? Why Does Obama Fear Him?","He s a controversial, conservative artist and he s coming after the Left. He s an outspoken, brave, modern-day Patriot, and he s not afraid to venture where conservatives have never gone. Sabo (his pseudonym) has shocked many liberals, and conservatives alike with his edgy artwork. It would be an understatement to say that he is constantly pushing the envelope. Whether you agree or disagree with him, conservatives should be thanking Sabo for utilizing his 1st Amendment Right, as he takes the fight against the Left to the streets of cities across America.If you want to help Sabo to create more of these important anti-Left messages leading up to the next election and beyond, please consider donating to him HERE. He s working to get an important message out to Americans, and more specifically to the younger voter. The only thing that pays for his supplies and his bill are donations from his supporters. Please consider helping him out. Here is his website: unsavoryagents.com and his STOREHere is an example of Sabo s most recent work:  Here is one of our personal favorites:  Hillary s baggage   When Democrat candidates come to town for a fundraiser, Sabo tries to have a surprise message waiting for them, like this great piece waiting for Hillary in Greenwich, CT: Here s a great welcome sign waiting for Hillary on the way to one of her fundraisers (courtesy of Sabo): And then there were the  special mile markers  created just for the Los Angeles Marathon:   The Obama Drone signs are some of our personal favorites. If Americans were smart, they d forgo a few hours of entertainment and stop funding these Hollywood freaks who support the destruction of our nation: He s not afraid to call out race baiters like Al Sharpton: And cry-baby college students looking for  safe spaces  are not immune to his counter-message. This poster mocks the #BlackLivesMatter (Anti-White) movement, and was plastered across the street from a college fraternity house: Sabo used this great illustration to point out the entitlement mentality of the Clinton Crime Syndicate who believes the throne (our White House) rightfully belongs to Hillary: Sabo makes no secret of his support for Ted Cruz. He has been a loyal supporter for years. This piece of art he created illustrates the kick ass, take-no-prisoners style of Ted Cruz that both the GOP and Left despise: Here is an interview with Glenn Beck that explains what motivates Sabo, and why he chose to use street art to get a conservative message out to Americans:Is it any wonder when Sabo saw this message from Obama s Secret Service hanging on his door, he wasn t too surprised? Sabo called the agent listed on the door hanger and scheduled a meeting at his home for 10 a.m. on Wednesday. Before the interview, Sabo posted the above image and alerted his Facebook friends and Twitter followers about the pending visit. Shortly after the Secret Service visit, Sabo posted a video that claims to cover most of the entire interview. Sabo told TheBlaze there was a little more to it, but  I just wanted to get it out.  You can watch the video of the visit here: (Warning: The video has some objectionable images and the dialogue contains profanity)Here is one of the tweets that supposedly brought the Secret Service to Sabo s door:A MESSAGE TO THE SECRET SERVICE.

After a lone gunman killed two civilians and a police officer in Colorado Springs, Colorado, the vice principal, Piet Lammert, took to Facebook to post his thoughts the next day:It s Small Business Saturday. Buy localThere s a show in the Strom tonight. Buy ticketsThe only terrorists we need to fear are domestic white  Christian  men with easy access to guns. Vote BernieThat is all. Enjoy your dayFive Town CSD Superintendent Maria Libby criticized the post, but defended the administrator. I know Piet and he s someone who genuinely accepts all people,  Libby tells WGME.  The post does not reflect who he is as a person. She didn t stop there. It was a mistake,  Libby says.  It was a poor choice in words and it should never have been posted.  The superintendent didn t specific what words would have been better to say.After it was posted, Libby said the situation  has been handled,  without giving any specifics. I have investigated it and I have taken appropriate action,  Libby would only say.Lammert took to Facebook to apologize to  those I offended,  but also to attempt to explain his comments.I am writing to take responsibility and apologize for a post that I made on my private Facebook account yesterday. I mistakenly left my setting open to  Public  and in doing so made a post that offended some members of our community and beyond. I deeply regret doing so, take full responsibility, and hope that those I offended will accept my apology.Apparently still feeling the public blow back from his remarks, the school administrator posted another apology, saying it was  an exaggeration. With true humility, I write to apologize for the offensive statement that I recently posted on Facebook. I did not intend this statement literally when I wrote it it was an exaggeration but soon after realized that it was unintentionally hurtful, offensive, and divisive at a time when more than ever we need compassion and understanding.In short, I did not mean what I said and wish with all my heart that I could take it back. But I need to take responsibility for it nonetheless, because I wrote it. It does not represent who I am or what I believe, but I wrote it. This post is an effort to at least begin to make amends.Had I simply written what I meant, the post would have reflected my urgent distress at the epidemic of mass violence in our country, which more recent events have proven to span all social groups. Ironically, in my effort to point out that we run the risk of simplifying the problem by singling out a particular ethnic group, I did exactly that to the group to which I belong. It was careless and rash.Lambert appears to have removed the offensive post from his Facebook page.

The  Miracle Mile,  located in the city of Chicago draws tens of thousands of shoppers every year at Christmas time. Imagine the faces of families of every ethnicity when they find out the City of Chicago is allowing these terrorists to prevent them from entering these stores? Roughly 3,000 demonstrators have shut down a large portion of Michigan Avenue in Chicago the  Magnificent Mile in the middle of Black Friday, the busiest shopping day of the year, to protest the shooting of black teenager Laquon McDonald.The 17-year-old was killed in October 2014, and was apparently armed with a knife at the time. Video of the shooting released on Tuesday, however, shows that he was walking away from police at the time he was shot 16 times by Officer Jason Van Dyke.Turnout was strong despite 39-degree weather and rainy conditions. Demonstrators shouted  16 shots!  and  No justice, no shopping! The march started at Michigan and Wacker Drive and began walking north. They include demonstrators from the Nation of Islam, which is marching under the banner of  Justice of Else ; RevCom, the Revolutionary Communist Party, and the Rev.

"#WarOnChristmas: Starbucks Attempts To Capitalize On Christmas By Erasing Any Sign Of Christmas From Red Cup","War on Christmas update: Some very clever people are asking you to join their campaign to remind Starbucks and their customers that Christmas is more than a red holiday!Social media has seized on the year-on-year stripping of Christmas-themed symbols from Starbucks  famous  Red Cups , with angry users tweeting #MerryChristmasStarbucks following a Breitbart London report on the company s  War on Christmas .When the coffee chain launched their 2015 seasonal cup design there was a marked difference from prior years, with no actual decoration being offered on the 2015 cups. The #RedCups press release described the cups as a  more open way to usher in the holiday. Breitbart London editor-in-chief Raheem Kassam broke the story last week, with CNN, the Huffington Post, the Telegraph, TIME magazine and others all following Breitbart s lead on the story of Christmas being eroded from the annually marketed Starbucks Christmas cups or  Red Cups. Members of the British Parliament, as well as Christian charities spoke out against the move, with Sir David Amess MP telling Breitbart London:  This is utter madness. Who was the idiot who thought this up? He should be sacked! Prior years have brandished illustrations from Christmas ornaments over evergreen tree branches to merry carolers and reindeer. Other years have been less obviously Christmas, but this year s offering bears zero illustrative reference to the Christmas season.Several stories have followed pondering the cultural  war on Christmas  and whether this year s Starbucks seasonal cups are indicative of a greater cultural cleansing of Christmas in the West.Some coffee shops haven t forgotten to remember Christmas is the reason we celebrate this season:#MerryChristmasStarbucks (from @DunkinDonuts this morning) pic.twitter.com/4I7IsDM5TQ  Michael Graham (@IAMMGraham) November 9, 2015Social media commenters indicated their disappointment with the naked design.

You can bet this is now a big problem for the FBI. President Trump is correct when he says the  FBI is in tatters Reddit reported:OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE FIRED ANTI-TRUMP FBI AGENT: This is an interesting development in the Mueller investigation because we don t trust the FBI. Is this new news from the New York Times an effort to make Mueller and McCabe appear unbiased? We re not buying it because this guy was the lead investigator in the Hillary email case Really??? Talk about compromised! Please see our previous report below on the FBI giving  special status  to Hillary s email investigation.Robert Mueller kicked a  top FBI agent  off the special counsel investigation this summer over potential anti-Trump texts he sent, per a new report today.According to The New York Times, Peter Strzok not only  helped lead  the investigation into Hillary Clinton s emails, but he  played a major role  in the Trump-Russia investigation.But he is no longer on the investigation:Mr. Strzok was reassigned this summer from Mr. Mueller s investigation to the F.B.I. s human resources department, where he has been stationed since. The people briefed on the case said the transfer followed the discovery of text messages in which Mr. Strzok and a colleague reacted to news events, like presidential debates, in ways that could appear anti-Trump.ABC News reported back in August that Strzok had left the investigation, but said at the time  it s unclear why Strzok stepped away from Mueller s team of nearly two dozen lawyers, investigators and administrative staffers. And The Washington Post s report today on Strzok contains some rather, well, personal details:During the Clinton investigation, Strzok was involved in a romantic relationship with FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who worked for Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, according to the people familiar with the matter, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue.The extramarital affair was problematic, these people said, but of greater concern among senior law enforcement officials were text messages the two exchanged during the Clinton investigation and campaign season, in which they expressed anti-Trump sentiments and other comments that appeared to favor Clinton Officials are now reviewing the communications to see if they show evidence of political bias in their work on the cases, a review which could result in a public report, according to people familiar with the matter.

"DETECTIVE ON SETH RICH Murder Mystery Drops Shocking News [Video]","Rod Wheeler was on Hannity last night with startling information on the Seth Rich murder mystery. He spoke about the mystery of why they can t locate the computer Rich used. They went on to discuss clues in the case that point to collusion between the DC police and the DNC. The most shocking information comes at the 4:20 mark when Wheeler says this:Rod Wheeler:  Here s one other thing that is going to be startling I m just gonna say this right now. I reached out to the police department way back in March when the family first hired me right..to get involved. I didn t hear anything from the police department for 2-3 days.Guess what I learned yesterday from the family of Seth Rich? The police department did not call me back because someone, a high ranking official at the DNC check this out a high ranking official at the DNC when I called the police department, they got that information and called the Rich family wanting to know, why was I snooping around? The plot thickens in this case. Will we finally find the murderer of this young man and who is behind it?IN CASE YOU HAVEN T SEEN UPDATES ON THIS CASE:CONFIRMED BOMBSHELL: SETH RICH Sent Over 44,000 DNC Emails To Journalist, Best Friend Of Wikileaks Founder DC Police Officer Claims They Were Told To  Stand Down  On Case [VIDEO]Wow! The private investigator hired by the Rich family to look into the death of 27-year old murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich just revealed some stunning evidence. It s been confirmed that over 44,000 emails and over 17,000 attachments were sent to the now deceased investigative journalist and best friend of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. Now that this new information has been made available to the public, will the media be asking Hillary or the DNC any questions about their involvement in Rich s death? Will the DOJ be opening an investigation into his death in light of this new stunning evidence? What about the alleged Russian hack of the DNC emails that the media tried to tie to President Trump?Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich s death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich s laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death.Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich s murder. He said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation. The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,  said Wheeler.  They haven t been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both. When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said,  Absolutely. Yeah. That s confirmed. Wheeler also told us,  I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said,  Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can t share any information with you.  Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I don t think it comes from the chief s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor s office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday].The Democratic National Committee staffer who was gunned down on July 10 on a Washington, D.C., street just steps from his home had leaked thousands of internal emails to WikiLeaks, law enforcement sources told Fox News.A federal investigator who reviewed an FBI forensic report detailing the contents of DNC staffer Seth Rich s computer generated within 96 hours after his murder, said Rich made contact with WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time.  FOX5DCHere is the tweet announcing the death of Gavin MacFayden only weeks before the U.S. presidential election:Gavin Macfadyen was mentor to Assange (and his closest friend in London), to WikiLeaks' Sarah Harrison, Joseph Farrell and many others.  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 23, 2016 I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,  the federal investigator told Fox News, confirming the MacFadyen connection. He said the emails are in possession of the FBI, while the stalled case is in the hands of the Washington Police Department.The revelation is consistent with the findings of Rod Wheeler, a former DC homicide detective and Fox News contributor and whose private investigation firm was hired by Rich s family to probe the case. Rich was shot from behind in the wee hours, but was not robbed. My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,  Wheeler said.  I do believe that the answers to who murdered Seth Rich sits on his computer on a shelf at the DC police or FBI headquarters. The federal investigator, who requested anonymity, said 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments between Democratic National Committee leaders, spanning from January 2015 through late May 2016, were transferred from Rich to MacFadyen before May 21.   FOX NewsWe reported on this story extensively. Here are some of our stunning findings over the past 10 months. It s pretty stunning that it took so long to find out about the e-mails on Rich s laptop: Conspiracy theories have been surrounding the murder of Seth Rich. They reached a new frenzy after the hacking of DNC e-mails led to the resignation of its chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz.Rich was beaten, shot and killed early on the morning of July 8 while he was walking home and talking on the phone to his girlfriend. Police have said they haven t determined if his murder was a botched robbery or something else. The killer or killers appear to have taken nothing from their victim, leaving behind his wallet, watch and phone.Wikileaks just confirmed murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich was the source of the DNC leak.Wikileaks released a series direct messages from US alleged  Russian spy  Guccifer 2.0 to actress model Robbin Young (according to Young).In the stream of texts the discussion leads to the DNC leaker.His name is  Seth ** In November Julian Assange said Russia did not hack into the DNC servers. -h/t GP Here s the proof:Direct Messages from U.S. alleged Russian spy @GUCCIFER_2 to actress-model @robbin_young (according to the latter) https://t.co/uMsB9WgxRQ  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) April 8, 2017Actress Robbin Young claims she had given this information she received from Guccifer 2.0 to the authorities but,  no one cared :https://twitter.com/Robbin_Young/status/850743524953702404Actress Robbin Young states that Guccifer 2.0 told her,  i m eager to find facts about seth, i m sure it wasn t just a robbery. seth was assassinated. :Guccifer 2.0 said, "i'm eager to find fact about seth"," i'm sure it wasn't just a robbery. seth was assassinated."" #SethRich  Robbin Young (@Robbin_Young) March 29"," 2017In June 2016"

"INVITED POP STAR SAYS SHELL PERFORM At Trump Inauguration ONLY If She Can Sing Song About Lynching Blacks","British pop singer Rebecca Ferguson, daughter of a white British woman and Jamaican father, says she has been invited to perform at Donald Trump s inauguration, but her response may not be the RSVP the President-elect s team were expecting.The former UK X-Factor runner-up said she would only accept the invitation on the condition that she could perform  Strange Fruit    a song protesting racism in 1930s America, made famous by Billie Holiday.The lyrics, written in the 1930s by Jewish communist Abel Meeropol, were composed as a protest poem to highlight endemic racism in America s southern states.The song s opening lyrics deal with lynching, which was still happening in parts of the country at the time: Southern trees bear strange fruit // Blood on the leaves and blood at the root // Black bodies swinging in the southern breeze // Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.According to Billie Holiday s Estate, Holiday regularly performed the song at live performances in 1939. Her record label, Columbia, refused to let her record the song under their name, so they granted her a one-session contractual release that gave Holiday clearance to independently record the track.Later that year, the album featuring  Strange Fruit  sold a million copies, becoming Holiday s biggest-selling record at the time. In 1978, the single was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.  Last month, The Beach Boys told CNN that the group has been contacted about performing, but that  no decision has been made at this point as to how or whether they will participate.

"BREAKING: Oregon Armed Militia Holding Federal Building [Video]","OREGON RANCHERS TAKE A STAND: The feds felt a rancher father and son didn t spend enough time in prison for arson so they ordered them jailed again. Father and son, Dwight and Steven Hammond, were ordered back to jail for burning land in an effort to keep it from endangering their property: CALL TO ACTION: PATRIOT CALL TO ACTION: A Major Storm Is Brewing In Oregon Over Fed Gov Charging Rancher With Terrorism For Insane ReasonHERE S THE LOWDOWN FROM SUPERSTATION95:The feds, operating outside the law, are trying to jail two men without legal jurisdiction. Instead the tables turned when armed Militiamen seized their federal complex instead!The Bundy family of Nevada joined with hard-core militiamen Saturday to take over the headquarters of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, vowing to occupy the remote federal outpost 50 miles southeast of Burns   pictured below   for years.The occupation came shortly after an estimated 300 marchers   militia and local citizens both   paraded through Burns to protest the prosecution of two Harney County ranchers, Dwight Hammond Jr. and Steven Hammond, who are to report to prison Monday.The story could set the stage for a western-style soap opera. I call it  as the sagebrush burns,  said Erin Maupin of the long and storied history involving the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), special interest groups and the cattle ranchers on the Steens Mountain of Oregon.The latest scene involved two ranchers being sentenced to five years in federal prison for inadvertantly burning about 140 acres of BLM rangeland in two separate fires, years ago. That is an area big enough to feed about three cow-calf pairs for a year in that neck of the woods.Dwight, 73 and son Steven, 46, admitted in a 2012 court case, to lighting two different fires. Both fires started on Hammonds  private property. An August lightening storm started numerous fires and a burn ban was in effect while BLM firefighters fought those fires. Despite the ban, without permission or notification to BLM, Steven Hammond started several  back fires  in an attempt to save the ranch s winter feed. The  back burn  fire break worked and protected the Hammond s ranch. BLM firefighters saw the back-burn and called it into their headquarters as an  arson. Sadly, wind drove the back-burn onto federal land, on which the Hammonds paid for grazing rights. Despite this, the US Attorney for Oregon prosecuted the two men, saying they committed arson against federal property along with nine other charges. The jury convicted the men of only two charges, starting the fires they readily admitted to starting.Arson against federal property calls for a mandatory minimum sentence of five years prison. The Hammonds argued that such minimum mandatory sentences were unconstitutional and a judge agreed. He sentenced the two men to LESS than the five years. Not satisfied, the US Attorney appealed and the Ninth US Circuit ordered the District Court to re-sentence the men in accordance with the statute.THE FIRES:The first, in 2001, was a planned burn on Hammonds  own property to reduce juniper trees that have become invasive in that part of the country. That fire burned outside the Hammonds  private property line and took in 138 acres of unfenced BLM land before the Hammonds got it put out. No BLM firefighters were needed to help extinguish the fire and no fences were damaged.Dwight s wife Susan shared some crucial details in an exclusive interview with SuperStation95. They called and got permission to light the fire,  she said, adding that was customary for ranchers conducting range management burns   a common practice in the area. We usually called the interagency fire outfit   a main dispatch   to be sure someone wasn t in the way or that weather would be a problem.  Susan said her son Steven was told that the BLM was conducting a burn of their own somewhere in the region that very same day, but that they believed there would be no problem with the Hammonds going ahead with their planned fire. The court transcript includes the same information in a recording from that phone conversation.In cross-examination of a prosecution witness, the court transcript also includes admission from Mr. Ward, a range conservationist that the 2001 fire improved the rangeland conditions on BLM.Maupin, a former range technician and watershed specialist who resigned from the BLM in 1999, said that collaborative burns between private ranchers and the BLM had become popular in the late 1990s because local university extension researchers were recommending it as a means to manage invasive juniper that steal water from grass and other cover. Juniper encroachment had become an issue on the forefront and was starting to come to a head. We were trying to figure out how to deal with it on a large scale,  said the woman whose family also neighbored the Hammonds for a couple of years. In 1999, the BLM started to try to do large scale burn projects. We started to be successful on the Steens Mountain especially when we started to do it on a large watershed scale as opposed to trying to follow property lines. Because private and federal land is intermingled, collaborative burns were much more effective than individual burns that would cover a smaller area, Maupin said.Susan said the second fire, in 2006, was a backfire started by Steven to protect their property from lightening fires. There was fire all around them that was going to burn our house and all of our trees and everything. The opportunity to set a back-fire was there and it was very successful. It saved a bunch of land from burning,  she remembers.The BLM asserts that one acre of federal land was burned by the Hammonds  backfire and Susan says determining which fire burned which land is  a joke  because fire burned from every direction.Neighbor Ruthie Danielson also remembers that evening and agrees.  Lightening strikes were everywhere, fires were going off,  she said.Maupin said prescribed burns to manage juniper were common in the late 1990s and early 2000s, best done late in the fall when the days are cooler.Prescribed burns on federal land in their area have all but stopped due to pressure from  special interest groups,  Maupin said. As a result, wildfires now burn much hotter due to a  ladder  of material on the ground   grass, brush and trees. The fires now burn really hot and they sterilize the ground. Then you have a weed patch that comes back. Maupin said planned burning in cooler weather like the Hammonds chose to do improves the quality of the forage, and makes for better sage grouse habitat by removing juniper trees that suck up water and house raptors   a sage grouse predator.// <![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_GB/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3""; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js"," fjs);}(document"," 'script'"

"FLASHBACK: CNN HOST Concerned Working Americans Are Going To Vote For Donald Trump Again After Getting Bonuses and Pay Raises","CNN s Allyson Camerota expressed her concern about how the tax breaks for Americans will harm the Democrats chances of winning in the mid-term elections with Michigan s Democrat Congresswoman Debbie Dingell.Camerota appeared somewhat panicked, as she started out her segment whining to Dingell about bonuses and pay raises that Americans will receive as a result of Trump s GOP tax bill:  Just, ever since the tax reform was announced, or the tax overhaul, or whatever you want to call it, there have been this whole slew of companies that have come forward and saying,  Guess what? We re going to give out bonuses, now, to our employees.  I mean, I have just a partial list in front of me, and there s nine companies on here from AT&T, to Boeing, to Comcast, Bank of America, Sinclair, Wells Fargo, PNC. There s all sorts of companies that say they re going to give something to a thousand dollars worth of bonuses to their hundreds of thousands of employees. Fifth Bank Corp is gonna boost the minimum wage to $15 per hour. Obviously, they could have done this before the tax overhaul was announced. They were sitting on profits. But they didn t, they did it when the tax overhaul was announced. And I m wondering if you, as a Democrat are you worried about the wind in their sails? People vote with their pocketbooks. I don t have to tell you this. So if you get a thousand dollar bonus, you re voting for Donald Trump again. Although Rep. Debbie Dingell (D-MI) voted against the tax cut bill, she smartly responded to Camerota s question by saying that she s  never going to complain that any working man or woman will get an extra boost in their, uh, income.  Dingell then told Camerota that at some point a lot of people are still going to see a tax increase at some point. Camerota interrupted her to say,  Years from now Years from now!

Rest assured, there will be many more liberal accusers who come out against Donald Trump, as racism appears to have lost its glow, as a means to draw voters into the Democrat Party, as Americans have become tired of watching Democrats constantly drawing from the bottom of the deck, as a way to cloud Trump s  Make America Great Again  agenda of a pro-growth economy, jobs, education, lower taxes, and America first.Megyn Kelly, who is desperate for ratings, must have been incredibly disappointed when breaking news of a botched suicide bomber attack in New York City was reported at the same time her Democrat Donald Trump accuser was telling her story on her show.Daily Mail A trio of the president s accusers reemerged on Monday to hound him for sexually harassing them.Samantha Holvey, Jessica Leeds and Rachel Crooks had previously made allegations against Trump and appeared on Megyn Kelly  Today  to demand justice as the White House resumed its claim that the issue had been litigated in last year s election. All of a sudden, he s all over, me, kissing and groping and groping and kissing,  said Leeds, a self-proclaimed Democrat, who says she revealed her story because  I wanted people to know what kind of a person that Trump really is what a pervert he is.

Leeds replied,  We have a problem in that we have been enculturated all of this time for all of this time, for years and years and years, to be compliant.  Leeds went on to say,  For the woman who voted for Trump, they just didn t want to vote for a woman   It became reasonably difficult to believe a single work Leeds had to say when she used the word enculturated  when referring to her alleged meeting with Donald Trump.

"JUST IN: ROY MOORE Accuser ADMITS to FORGING Yearbook","The credibility of Beverly Young Nelson, the woman who accused Roy Moore of making sexual advances toward her when she was a teen, has been shattered.  Shortly after Nelson appeared on television with leftist attorney Gloria Allred,  her stepson made the difficult decision of coming out and saying that his stepmother was lying in a Facebook video he made to set the record straight about his father s wife.Watch video:(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = 'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.11';  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));My official statementPosted by Darrel Nelson on Tuesday, November 14, 2017Meanwhile, Twitter user Thomas Wictor made his case through a series of tweets that the alleged Roy Moore signature in a high school yearbook Nelson used as  evidence  of her story was forged. Conservative media outlets began to demand that the yearbook was examined by a neutral party. Nelson and her attorney, Gloria Allred refused. Nelson remained silent for weeks while the controversy about the allegedly forged high school yearbook continued to catch fire in the media.Breitbart News reports that Beverly Young Nelson has finally admitted that she forged a portion of the infamous high school yearbook that she and attorney Gloria Allred used as proof of her accusations against U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore.And in yet another blow to the credibility of ABC News, the disgraced, left-wing network downplayed the bombshell by presenting this admission of forgery as adding  notes  to the inscription. Worse still, the reporter actually coaches Nelson, puts words in her mouth, downplay the enormous significance of her deceit.Beverly Young Nelson, one of the women accusing GOP Senate candidate Roy Moore of sexual misconduct, tells @GMA it  sickens  her to think what might happen if Moore is elected. https://t.co/wuEGWr0kng pic.twitter.com/lcp5OY4x3A  ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) December 8, 2017 Nelson admits she did make notes to the inscription,  ABC News tells us.  But the message was all Roy Moore. ABC News reporter Tom Llamas just couldn t help himself, as he coaches Nelson to make sure she is still able to cling to a portion of her story:Llamas:  Beverly, he signed your yearbook. Nelson:  He did sign it. Llamas, for his part encouraged her to get her story straight:  And you made some notes underneath. Nelson replied:  Yes. And then, after a woman admits to forging a document used in a campaign to destroy the Republican nominee for the U.S. Senate in Alabama, ABC News quickly moves on as though it is not news of extraordinary consequence.Llamas also fails to ask any follow-ups, such as  If the explanation is this simple, why wait all these weeks to offer it?  Or,  Why did you lie? Nelson is accusing Moore of attempting to assault her when she was just 16-years-old. With the election just four days away, this admission of forgery could not come at a better time for Moore. Nelson and Allred are planning a news conference Friday, but nothing will overcome the forgery admission.How can anyone believe anything she says after admitting to such a thing? Early reports are that Nelson and Allred will produce an expert to prove the rest of the yearbook is not a forgery. So a proven forger is bringing in her own expert. What an insult to the people of Alabama.Another problem with Nelson is that she has a motive to lie and forge: as a circuit judge, Moore ruled against her in a 1999 divorce case.The Moore campaign has been pressuring Nelson and Allred for weeks to submit the yearbook for independent handwriting analysis. Now everyone knows why that request was rejected and ignored.With Nelson now thoroughly discredited, this leaves two accusers against Moore.One is Leigh Corfman, who claims Moore molested her as a 14-year-old child. She is the most credible of the three, but the narrative behind her story, that Moore s abuse resulted in Corfman s living a troubled life of  drinking, drugs, boyfriends, and a suicide attempt,  is directly contradicted by contemporaneous court records.Moore s final accuser is Tina Johnson, a woman who claims Moore groped her butt in his office in 1991. But, again, as was the case with Corfman and Nelson, the left-wing media outlets reporting these allegations (the Washington Post, AL.com) either failed to fully vet the accusers or withheld crucial context.Thanks to New Media s going behind these discredited outlets to fact check the reporting, we now know that Johnson did not tell the entire truth. She was not in Moore s office  on business.  If she was in Moore s office at all, it was due to a bitter custody battle where Moore represented Johnson s mother, who was trying to gain custody of Johnson s 12-year-old son based on the claim that Johnson was an  unfit, absent, and unstable mother. If the media and the accusers and Gloria Allred told the full truth to begin with, they would all be more credible.Here are close up versions of the signatures. Note, that when viewed close up, the signature is signed in both black and blue ink.Here is a closer version of the yearbook signature:Here is Wictor s explanation for the different colors of ink:(4) The LIGHT is reflecting off of the ink.The ink that LOOKS blue is actually black. It's DIFFERENT ink than the ORIGINAL ink.Therefore it reflects light differently.  Thomas Wictor (@ThomasWictor) November 16, 2017(11) So, to recap:The signature is a forgery, and everything after the name "Roy-Ray"" was added later with different ink. pic.twitter.com/1sPv6aABge  Thomas Wictor (@ThomasWictor) November 15"," 2017Just like the ""TH"" doomed Dan Rather"," ""DA"" will doom the anti Roy Moore forces.

It was a clear play at attempting to convince voters that the Democrats are suddenly the party of morals.Do Democrats really believe Americans will be duped into believing that the party who cheated Bernie Sanders, (who wrote about how women fantasize about being gang-raped) out of the chance to be the Democrat nominee for President, to make Hillary Clinton, (a woman who has been accused of enabling her accused rapist husband, who has also been accused several times of sexual assault, and was impeached for lying about having sex with a 19-year old intern under his desk in the Oval Office) is somehow now the  moral  party?Here s  what Bernie had to say about President Trump yesterday:Washington Examiner    We have a president of the United States who acknowledged on a time widely seen all over this country that he assaulted women, so I would hope that maybe the POTUS might pay attention to what s going on and also think about resigning,  Sanders told CBS News on Thursday.Bernie recently said it was not up to the Senate or Democrat Party to call on Senator Franken to step down. Watch, as Sanders glosses over the question when asked about his previous statement (before Democrats decided Franken was a scalp they could spare for the sake of the party)."What I worry about right now"," as we speak"," in restaurants and in offices all over this country where you have bosses who are not famous"

"WILL OBAMA REGIME Be Held Accountable For Dirty Tactics They Used To Take Down MICHAEL FLYNN?","While we re on the subject of lying to the FBI, when will Hillary Clinton be prosecuted for multiple crimes she committed while acting as our Secretary of State?  Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn admitted Friday to making false statements to the FBI, entering the first guilty plea in Special Counsel Robert Mueller s Russia probe   and agreeing to cooperate with investigators.A source close to Flynn said financial and emotional pressure helped lead to the decision to plead guilty, rather than endure a drawn-out court battle.As part of the deal, Flynn already is supplying information about the actions of top Trump transition officials.Though the individuals are not named, court documents show Flynn claiming a  very senior member  of the Trump transition team directed him to contact foreign governments including Russia over a United Nations vote   discussions tied to one of Flynn s false statements.The documents also say Flynn called an unnamed senior transition official in December to ask what to communicate to the Russian ambassador about sanctions. That official and Flynn discussed how they didn t want Russia to  escalate the situation,  something Flynn immediately told the ambassador in a phone call.According to the plea deal, Flynn has agreed to  cooperate fully, truthfully, completely and forthrightly  with the probe, with sentencing delayed until those efforts  have been completed. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, becomes the first Trump ex-White House official charged in the special counsel probe.His tenure at the White House was brief   he was fired for similar conduct, pertaining to his undisclosed discussions with the Russians   and Flynn had been under investigation even before the special counsel probe over lobbying work for Turkey and other issues. The fact that he faced just one count prompted immediate speculation Friday that Flynn was cooperating and offering information to Mueller s team.As for the past discussions between Flynn and transition officials, it s unclear which senior officials the plea deal referred to. But a former senior intelligence officer with knowledge of Trump transition activities told Fox News that then-President-Elect Trump directed Flynn during that period to contact the Russians   while also directing him and his team to contact 12 other countries. The transition team felt that the Obama White House had completely abandoned any coherent foreign policy and had to fill the vacuum,  the former official told Fox News.In a statement, White House lawyer Ty Cobb said  nothing  about the plea implicates anyone other than Flynn. NBC News tweeted Cobb s statement:Today, Michael Flynn, a former National Security Advisor at the White House for 25 days during the Trump Administration, and a former Obama administration official, entered a guilty plea to a single count of making a false statement to the FBI. The false statements involved mirror the false statements to White House officials which resulted in his resignation in February of this year. Nothing about the guilty plea or the charge implicates anyone other than Mr. Flynn. The conclusion of this phase of the Special Counsel s work demonstrates again that the Special Counsel is moving with all deliberate speed and clears the way for a prompt and reasonable conclusion.

"BLACK CAUCUS MEMBER From Impoverished Detroit District Whos Leading Effort To Impeach President Trump&CAUGHT Paying Off Sex Assault Victims With Taxpayer Money","This story is about more than a massive cover-up for an elected officials who sexually assaulted innocent women, it s also about the media s lack of desire to report about crimes that have obviously been covered up in DC for a very long time. Perhaps the media s reluctance to report about the sexual abuse taking place in Washington DC, is because most, if not all, of the elected officials whose crimes are now being uncovered, are Democrats? So far, two of the most rabid anti-Trump Democrats in Washington, Senator Al Franken (D-MI) and now Representative John Conyers (D-MI) have been outed is it a coincidence, or could it be that one of the reasons Democrats are so adamantly opposed to Trump s presidency is because he is shaking things up in Washington, and in doing so, he s breaking up the good ole  boys network?Buzzfeed   Michigan Rep. John Conyers, a Democrat and the longest-serving member of the House of Representatives, settled a wrongful dismissal complaint in 2015 with a former employee who alleged she was fired because she would not  succumb to [his] sexual advances. Documents from the complaint obtained by BuzzFeed News from Mike Cernovich, include four signed affidavits, three of which are notarized, from former staff members who allege that Conyers, the ranking Democrat on the powerful House Judiciary Committee, repeatedly made sexual advances to female staff that included requests for sexual favors, contacting and transporting other women with whom they believed Conyers was having affairs, caressing their hands sexually, and rubbing their legs and backs in public. Four people involved with the case verified the documents are authentic.And the documents also reveal the secret mechanism by which Congress has kept an unknown number of sexual harassment allegations secret: a grinding, closely held process that left the alleged victim feeling, she told BuzzFeed News, that she had no option other than to stay quiet and accept a settlement offered to her. I was basically blackballed. There was nowhere I could go,  she said in a phone interview. BuzzFeed News is withholding the woman s name at her request because she said she fears retribution.Last week the Washington Post reported that Congress s Office of Compliance paid out $17 million for 264 settlements with federal employees over 20 years for various violations, including sexual harassment. The Conyers documents, however, give a glimpse into the inner workings of the office, which has for decades concealed episodes of sexual abuse by powerful political figures.The woman who settled with Conyers launched the complaint with the Office of Compliance in 2014, alleging she was fired for refusing his sexual advances, and ended up facing a daunting process that ended with a confidentiality agreement in exchange for a settlement of more than $27,000. Her settlement, however, came from Conyers  office budget rather than the designated fund for settlements.Congress has no human resources department. Instead, congressional employees have 180 days to report a sexual harassment incident to the Office of Compliance, which then leads to a lengthy process that involves counseling and mediation, and requires the signing of a confidentiality agreement before a complaint can go forward.After this an employee can choose to take the matter to federal district court, but another avenue is available: an administrative hearing, after which a negotiation and settlement may follow.In this case, one of Conyers  former employees was offered a settlement, in exchange for her silence, that would be paid out of Conyers  taxpayer-funded office budget. His office would  rehire  the woman as a  temporary employee  despite her being directed not to come into the office or do any actual work, according to the document. The complainant would receive a total payment of $27,111.75 over the three months, after which point she would be removed from the payroll, according to the document.The draft agreement viewed by BuzzFeed News was unsigned, but congressional employment records match the timing and amounts outlined in the document. The woman left the office and never went public with her story.The process was  disgusting,  said Matthew Peterson, who worked as a law clerk representing the complainant, and who listed as a signatory to some of the documents.Hillary Clinton and John Conyers have been longtime friends. What is it about Hillary that sexual predators find so endearing?  It is a designed cover-up,  said Peterson, who declined to discuss details of the case but agreed to characterize it in general terms.  You feel like they were betrayed by their government just for coming forward. It s like being abused twice. Two staffers alleged in their signed affidavits that Conyers used congressional resources to fly in women they believed he was having affairs with. Another said she was tasked with driving women to and from Conyers  apartment and hotel rooms.Rep. Conyers did not admit fault as part of the settlement. His office did not respond to multiple requests for comment on Monday.Citizen journalist Mike Cernovich admonishes  journalists  who are tasked with reporting the news for a living for ignoring how massive this cover up really is:The Conyers settlement was 1 out of 264!How about you "journalists"" stop hating on me and go find those other 263?

"Viewers Are DEMANDING Shepard Smith Be FIRED After Fox News Leftist Host, Shepard Smith, Pulled UNBELIEVABLE Propaganda Stunt Last Night [VIDEO]","Only one day ago, FOX News published a factual story outlining Hillary s involvement in the sale of uranium to Russia while she was acting as Barack Obama s Secretary of State.Fox News  What was the Uranium One deal?In 2013, Rosatom, backed by the Russian state, acquired a Canadian uranium mining company, now called Uranium One, which has assets in the U.S. Uranium is key to making nuclear weapons.Through the deal, Russia is able to own about 20 percent of U.S. uranium production capacity. However, Colin Chilcoat, an energy affairs specialist who has written extensively about Russia s energy deals, said that the company only extracts about 11 percent of uranium in the U.S.The deal also  doesn t allow for that uranium to be exported at all,  Chilcoat told Fox News.  It s not like it s leaving the U.S. or somehow finding its way to more insidious players. The agreement was approved by nine government agencies with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), an inter-agency group that reviews how certain foreign investments can impact national security. Clinton s State Department was one of those agencies, though the former secretary of state told WMUR-TV in 2015 that she was not  personally involved  in the agreement.Why is it controversial? Republicans have largely decried the deal, especially as some investors reportedly donated millions of dollars to the Clinton Foundation. Former President Bill Clinton also received a $500,000 speaking fee in Russia and reportedly met with Vladimir Putin around the time of the deal.The FBI had looked into the agreement and uncovered that some Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in nefarious dealings, which included extortion, bribery, and kickbacks, The Hill reported. Evidence of wrongdoing by Vadim Mikerin, the Russian official overseeing Putin s nuclear expansion in the U.S. who was eventually sentenced to prison, was discovered by the FBI before the deal was approved, according to The Hill.Author Peter Schweizer   who wrote about the deal in his 2015 book  Clinton Cash    told Fox News that there is no evidence that the people involved with approving the agreement knew that the FBI had an ongoing investigation into it.Republicans say the whole affair raises serious questions. Now it s the Democrats who have some explaining to do,  Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement.  I hope they will cooperate with the investigation, be forthcoming with the American people and I expect the media to cover these new developments with the same breathless intensity that they have given to this investigation since day one. Yesterday, the liberal Fox News host, Shepard Smith infuriated a large number of the network s viewers on Tuesday after a six-minute segment in which he debunked far-right conspiracy theories about Hillary Clinton s alleged wrongdoing in a sale of American uranium. The segment was surprising given that a number of broadcasters on Smith s own network have promoted the idea that Clinton broke the law in approving the sale to foreign buyers who also donated to her husband s foundation.Smith said many claims about Clinton s supposed role in the uranium sale were  inaccurate    even as President Donald Trump and his supporters are calling for a federal investigation.The Fox News host began the segment by summarizing the particulars of the sale of Uranium One, a Canadian firm with rights to mine US uranium.Rosatom, a Russian firm, acquired a majority stake in Uranium One in 2010 and bought the remainder of the company in 2013.The segment infuriated Fox News viewers who demanded Smith be fired. Shep Smith needs to be fired for his biased reporting,  tweeted one Fox News viewer.  Daily Mail Twitter went nuts over the 6-minute propaganda piece on FOX News last night.Here are just a few of the tweets that blasted the whiny, liberal FOX News host for his disgusting liberal bias.Shepard Smith: AFFIRMATIVE ACTIONThe wrench in the @FoxNews wheel.PLEASE DUMP THE HACK.   pic.twitter.com/6xQnDBcA7K  thebradfordfile (@thebradfordfile) November 15, 2017Raise your hand  If you change the channel when thisObnoxiousFake Overly made-upLiberal shillBeta maleComes on@FoxNews #FireShep Shepard Smith Covers for Hillary, Spreads FAKE NEWS on #UraniumOne#WednesdayWisdom https://t.co/MBTIXz7uHz via @truthfeednews  SparkleMAGA  (@SparkleSoup45) November 15, 2017Most viewers of FOX  News question why the only conservative-leaning cable news show would want someone like Shepard Smith driving viewers away.

The leftist media is now being forced to discuss how Democrats have turned a blind eye to decades of criminal sexual assaults by Bill Clinton and given a pass to his wife Hillary, who enabled him by threatening his victims to remain silent.Four days ago, the hard-left MSNBC host Chris Hayes made a stunning admission about the hypocrisy of the Democrat Party, and how they are  long overdue for a real reckoning with the allegations against Bill Clinton that have been swept under the carpet, while the victims were shamed.As gross and cynical and hypocrtical as the right's "what about Bill Clinton"" stuff is"," it's also true that Democrats and the center left are overdue for a real reckoning with the allegations against him.

The stories of at least 2 of his accusers have been unraveling after non-mainstream media uncovered that one of the anti-Trump accusers worked for Hillary and openly promoted Moore s Democrat opponent on her Facebook page. The mother of another accuser is challenging the truth behind the Washington Post s hit story as well.Curiously, the person who sent the tweet that Keurig responded to is none other than Angelo Carusone, the president of GEORGE SOROS  Media Matters of America.

"WHY WAS Mandalay Bay Security Guard Caught By Border Agents Crossing Into US From Mexico Only Days After Massacre?","Mandalay Bay security guard Jesus Campos mysteriously left the country just days after the Las Vegas massacre, a report says.Customs and Border Patrol documents obtained by Fox News show that the 25-year-old entered the United States from Mexico at the San Ysidro border crossing in California   one week after the mass shooting.It s unclear how long Campos was out of the country. The documents only show that he re-entered the US.The young man reportedly crossed the border at the same location in January.While Campos was driving his own vehicle with Nevada plates during that trip, sources told Fox he took a rental car this time around   which was registered in California.The new information raises even more questions about Stephen Paddock s Oct. 1 massacre   such as why authorities would allow Campos to leave the country in the middle of their investigation or how the security guard managed to make it down to Mexico with a gunshot wound to his leg.But was Campos really a security guard? According to Nevada law, every security guard in the state of Nevada has to register as an armed or unarmed guard with the state s Private Investigator s Licensing Board (PILB).

"WATCH: SANCTIMONIOUS ANTI-TRUMP Hollywood IMPLODES&Best Friends Turn On Each Other To Save Their Careers and Their New Movie SUBURBICON","Anti-Trump besties Matt Damon and George Clooney sat down with Good Morning America s Michael Strahan to discuss their good friend, Democrat mega-donor and accused rapist and serial sexual predator, Harvey Weinstein. Not only did both actors, who owe much of their successful careers to Harvey Weinstein, wait until their reputations were on the line to speak out about the sexual predator, but they waited until only days before their new movie,  SUBURBICON  is about to debut, to say that they actually knew more about the abuse women received at the hands of the bully movie mogul than they had previously admitted to.Notably absent in the interview is the third actor Ben Affleck, who completes the trio of bestie actors. After Affleck spoke out on the Harvey Weinstein controversy, he was also accused of covering up Weinstein s behavior, as well as videos that show Affleck used his power to prey on innocent women. Notice how quickly Damon throws Affleck under the bus, saying he knew, but only told Damon (who of course, never told anyone else).Americans who are sick and tired of sanctimonious, holier-than-thou liberals who have no values or morals, yet try to shame Americans for supporting political candidates who don t hold the same liberal views as theirs, are left with only one option #BoycottSuburbicon and #BoycottHollywood In the interview that aired on Monday morning, George Clooney and Matt Damon said that they knew Weinstein was a  bully  and  womanizer  who bragged of bedding actresses but had no idea about the level of criminal behavior that was occurring behind closed doors in hotels.Damon also confessed that he was aware Weinstein had sexually harassed  the first lady of Miramax  Gwyneth Paltrow just before the actress shot the 1996 film adaptation of Jane Austen s  Emma  for the studio. I knew the story about Gwyneth from Ben [Affleck] because he was with her after Brad [Pitt] and so I knew that story,  said Damon. But I was working with Gwyneth and with Harvey on [the 1999 film  The Talented Mr.] Ripley. He then added:   I never talked to Gwyneth about it but Ben told me that whatever or agreement they had come to there was an understanding   and he treated her incredibly respectfully. Always. Affleck and Pitt have not spoken about the incident, and Damon s revelation that he learned about Weinstein s behavior from his friend may cause even more problems for the embattled actor as it seems to contradict his initial statement. I am saddened and angry that a man who I worked with used his position of power to intimidate, sexually harass and manipulate many women over decades,  said Affleck almost one week after news of the scandal broke in a carefully-worded response that seemed to suggest he had never before heard any of the allegations.Damon s decision to characterize the relationship between Paltrow and Weinstein as  always  respectful is a bit odd as well, considering her admission that she had been sexually harassed by the mogul is part of the reason the men were sitting down for the interview.Clooney meanwhile said that like many of Weinstein s victims, he had been told a number of times by the mogul that he was bedding a number of stars. Harvey would talk to me about women that he had had affairs with,  said Clooney. I didn t necessarily believe him quite honestly because to believe him would be to believe the worst of some actresses who were friends of mine, and I didn t really think that they had affairs with Harvey   and clearly, they didn t.He then added:  But the idea that this predator, this assaulter was out there silencing women like that, it s beyond infuriating. And the fact that the story is coming out now and the more it comes out, I want to know all of it.

"MUST WATCH: SEN TED CRUZ Tells SEN BERNIE SANDERS To Curb Your Enthusiasm In Hilarious Moment During CNN Debate","Two US Senators who couldn t be more ideologically opposed, Republican Senator Ted Cruz and Independent (Socialist Party) Senator Bernie Sanders came together for what ended up being a very entertaining debate on the subject of the GOP tax plan during a debate hosted by CNN.The polarizing topic has been at the center of Capitol Hill, as lawmakers have attempted to reform the tax code. Republicans, in an effort to pass the tax code, have explored trying to pass tax reform without Democratic support; while Democrats have complained that they have been left out of a crucial, bipartisan process in governing.Included in the GOP tax plan is a 20% corporate tax rate, the elimination of the estate tax, and the implementation of three tax brackets.Cruz defended the plan, saying on CNN,  Republicans want to lower the taxes for each and every person watching this debate,  and said that lowering the corporate tax rate would allow businesses to create more jobs.Sanders, however, said the GOP s tax plan is about giving  tax breaks to people who don t need it.  The senator said he supports  a tax cut for the middle class and working families. Throughout the evening, the two senators threw several verbal jabs at each other s expense.At one point, Cruz claimed that his 2016 presidential campaign tried to strengthen social security and said politicians in Washington were  recklessly letting it careen towards insolvency. There are no changes at all,  Cruz said.  Every dollar, every penny of benefit is protected, but for young people, people my age  You re not so young anymore,  Sanders replied. You d be surprised,  Cruz said.Cruz also joked about the impersonation that comedian Larry David, star of HBO s  Curb Your Enthusiasm  did of Sanders on an episode of  Saturday Night Live. I m not interrupting you,  Sanders said, waving his hand as a sign for Cruz to hurry.  Come on, come on. You know, as some might say, curb your enthusiasm,  Cruz quipped.

A close friend of the now disgraced Hollywood kingpin producer and sexual predator, Harvey Weinstein, Ben Affleck, has received quite a bit of criticism after women in the industry came forward to accuse him of being complicit in Weinstein s behavior, and have even accused him of disgusting and inappropriate sexual behavior toward women in the industry.The lone female superhero, Gal Gadot, who plays Wonder Woman in the upcoming movie, recently came out with a statement of support for fellow actresses who have been victims of sexual abuse and condemnation for their sexual harassers: Ben Affleck, who stars as Batman in the Harvey Weinstein Batman Vs. Superman movie is not the only actor who should be shunned by moviegoers. It s time for the spotlight to be shined on a few of the other actors in the Weinstein movie, including  Justice League  actor Jeremy Irons.Actor Jeremy Irons, who won a  Best Actor  Academy Award for his role in  Reversal of Fortune , is set to play the role of Batman s butler, Alfred J. Pennyworthy in Weinstein s Batman sequel  Justice League . Hollywood has clearly been ignoring sexual predators like Harvey Weinstein, Woody Allen, and Ben Affleck for decades, so it s not too surprising that Jeremy Irons has somehow managed to escape scrutiny by the media, and by his fellow Hollywood actors, after the disgusting remarks he made following his lead role as a pedophile in the controversial  Lolita  movie.In 1998, Jeremy Irons starred as a pedophile in the movie Lolita, that was based on a 1955 novel written by Russian American novelist Vladimir Nabokov. The novel is notable for its controversial subject: the protagonist and unreliable narrator a middle-aged literature professor called Humbert Humbert is obsessed with the 12-year-old Dolores Haze, with whom he becomes sexually involved after he becomes her stepfather.  Lolita  is his private nickname for Dolores.Telegraph   The actor Jeremy Irons, who starred in the film Lolita, says the  hysteria  sweeping the country over pedophilia is damaging relations between adults and children.Irons, who has two sons with his wife Sinead Cusack, says it is important to uphold a rigid social morality but also vital that adults are allowed to show affection to children.Pedophilia should be treated as a disease, he says in a BBC interview to be screened next week. But it must also be recognized that children are attractive and that parental love has a  sexual  element. It is very difficult because children under 16 are immensely attractive,  he says.  Any father will tell you. I think our children have to be protected. But I don t think we need to have hysteria. In the interview, Irons says his character was not a pedophile in the strict sense, as he  knew that what he was doing was wrong . Referring to his family, he describes the difficulties of judging the line between natural affection and pedophilia. I remember when my son was 12 and he was like a god. He just went through that sort of golden time for about 18 months. I don t have a daughter but they do the same. Parental love is sexual. Children practice on their parents. Girls will flirt outrageously with their fathers because they are practicing. But we should know that that is practice. Boys will flirt outrageously with their mothers in a different way. His comments were seized on by child protection charities. The NSPCC said:  Such comments are ambiguous and could be interpreted by sex offenders as a justification for their behavior. Esther Rantzen, the chairman of ChildLine, said:  The words  immensely attractive  are not the best thing to say about children under 16.  Appealing or charming  are more appropriate. Irons, 56, made the remarks when asked about his portrayal of Humbert Humbert, the lecturer who falls for a young girl in the film of Vladimir Nabokov s novel Lolita. When the film came out in 1998, he suggested that child abuse did not always ruin the life of the victim.In the video below, Jeremy Irons arrogantly discusses his own brilliance as he portrays a pedophile in  Lolita . Go to the 7:50 mark to hear Irons tell the interviewers how  devastatingly attractive  many 15-year-old girls are. The greatness of the performance that Dominique Swain gives, is that she is all of our daughters. Funny, wacky, silly, attractive, because many girls of 15 are devastatingly attractive. WATCH:Irons also once posed the question about whether or not a son should be able to marry his father:NYDN -Academy Award-winning actor Jeremy Irons said Wednesday that while he doesn t have much of a strong opinion either way on same-sex marriage, he believes it poses interesting questions, including whether allowing same-sex marriage would open the door for interfamilial relationships. Could a father not marry his son?  Irons asked HuffPost Live host Josh Zepps. Irons argued that  it s not incest between men  because  incest is there to protect us from inbreeding, but men don t breed,  and wondered whether same-sex marriage might allow fathers to pass on their estates to their sons without being taxed.Jason Momoa who plays  Aquaman  in in Weinstein s  Justice League  movie was recently attacked on social media after a video was being circulated of him making a disgusting  joke  during a public forum, where he bragged about the benefit of being able to play  Khal Drogo  on the  Game of Thrones  series, and how he is able to  rape beautiful women and get away with it .   Weinstein s  Justice Leauge  movie,  surfaced on Twitter, where he was seen discussing as far as sci-fi and fantasy, I love that there s so many things you can do like rip someone s tongue out of their throat and get away with it and rape beautiful women.

"WATCH: HANOI JANE FONDA Had Chance To Expose Sexual Predator Harvey Weinstein One Year Ago&The Reason DIDNT Is LAUGHABLE","Speaking to Bill Maher about her participation in the Women s March in DC,  Hanoi Jane  Fonda remarked about her ability to use her celebrity to express her hate for Donald Trump to the masses. Fonda told Maher that one of the benefits of being a celebrity is that you can bring attention to things that need to be addressed, she then went on to refer to President Trump as the  Predator in Chief . Of course, Hanoi Jane had no evidence whatsoever to back up such a hideous claim, yet, she made the claim anyhow. As it turns out, Hanoi Jane actually knew about a certain sexual predator who actually assaulted a much younger actress only one year ago. That younger actress was Rosana Arquette, who shared her horrible experience with the  celebrity  Jane Fonda. Fonda, who bragged about having so much power to bring attention to important issues, did absolutely nothing about it.Hypocrite Hanoi Jane would rather stay mum about an actual sexual predator who was harming so many young women in her industry, than risk being ostracized in Hollywood. It was better to just stick to the  hate Trump  script and get along with the other sickening hypocrites in Hollywood than to expose a serial sexual predator who should ve been stopped years ago if there weren t so many self-serving and shallow human beings running around Hollywood.

"MIKE DITKA SLAMS NFL Players: No Oppression In Last 100 Years&If You Dont Respect Our Country, Then You Shouldnt Be In This Country Playing Football","Wow! Former Bears coach Mike Ditka is coming under fire from the liberal media and Black Lives Matter activists for saying there has been  no oppression in the last 100 years .Former Chicago Bears star and coach Mike Ditka, an adamant critic of NFL players kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial discrimination, said Monday in a national radio interview that this country has been free of oppression for at least a century. All of a sudden, it s become a big deal now, about oppression,  Ditka told Jim Gray on Westwood One s pregame show ahead of the Bears   Monday Night Football  loss to the Vikings.  There has been no oppression in the last 100 years that I know of. Now maybe I m not watching it as carefully as other people. As a side note, the now unemployed and clearly  oppressed  49 ers QB, Colin Kaepernick who started kneeling to show his unity with the anti-cop, Black Lives Matter movement, listed his humble abode in San Jose, CA, 10 months ago, for a mere $2.9 million.According to Realtor.com, the gated four-bedroom, 5.5-bath estate features 4,500 square feet of living space on a 20,000-square-foot secluded lot with a long private driveway and expansive views of the valley.Ditka continued: Is that the stage for this? If you want to protest, or whatever you want to protest, you ve got a right to do that, but I think you re a professional athlete, you have an obligation to the game,  Ditka said.  I think you have to respect the game. That s what I think is the most important thing. I don t see a lot of respect for the game. I just see respect for their own individual opinions. Opinions are like noses, we all have one. Some are good. Some are bad. Ditka insisted he wasn t  condemning anybody or criticizing anybody  but urged players to  protest when the game s over, protest whatever other way you want to  and said he would bench players who insisted on demonstrating during the anthem because it s disrespectful. If you don t respect our country, then you shouldn t be in this country playing football,  he said.  Go to another country and play football. If you had to go somewhere else to try to play the sport, you wouldn t have a job. So that would be my take. If you can t respect the flag and the country, then you don t respect what this is all about. So I would say, adios. Gray cited athletes such as Muhammad Ali and Jesse Owens who have taken on social injustices, but Ditka was unmoved. I don t know what social injustices have been,  Ditka said.  Muhammad Ali rose to the top. Jesse Owens is one of the classiest individuals that ever lived. I mean, you can say,  Are you (saying) everything is based on color?  I don t see it that way. I think that you have to be color blind in this country. You ve got to look at a person for what he is and what he stands for and how he produces, not by the color of his skin. That has never had anything to do with anything. Ditka said there are opportunities for everyone in the United States, regardless of race, religion, creed, color, nationality  if you want to work, if you want to try, if you want to put effort into yourself. I think you can accomplish anything, and we have watched that throughout our history of our country. People rise to the top and they became very influential people in our country by doing the right things.   Trib LiveMost of America gets what Ditka is trying to say when he says there has been  no oppression for 100 years . He s clearly referring to the era of slavery. The idea, however, that Ditka would point out that slavery ended 100 years ago, and that we are, and have been, for decades, a nation of equal opportunity for all, was more than the left and the liberal media could bear.

In case anyone forgot, Hillary Clinton actually was called a  nasty woman  by then-candidate Trump during one of the presidential debates. Hillary and her liberal Hollywood friends turned Trump s remark about her into a fundraiser to support abortion. The t-shirt was in response to President Trump s tweet criticizing the politician where he referred to her actions as  nasty  and NOT the mayor. It hasn t taken the American public long to figure out that the mayor of San Juan is not only  nasty , but ungrateful and apparently, someone who just can t get enough attention.

"BREAKING REPORT: HILLARY SUPPORTER, CEO Of Las Vegas MGM and Mandalay Bay Resort Asked Employees To Donate To CAIR Only 2 Months Ago, Wife Worked For Obama","On August 15, 2017, Jim Murren, CEO of MGM which owns Mandalay Bay Casino and Resort, came out with a bold statement of support for Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign: As a lifelong registered Republican, I ve crossed the aisle only a few times in elections past, and almost never at the presidential level. Each time, it was a gut-wrenching decision.But this year it s an easy choice. I m going to put my country ahead of my party by voting for Hillary Clinton   and by making my first-ever public endorsement of a presidential candidate. Breaking from investigative reporter Laura Loomer*: EXCLUSIVE: In this internal memo I have obtained, Jim Murren, the CEO of MGM resorts which owns Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino (where Stephen Paddock committed his massacre) asked employees to donate to CAIR, a documented terrorist organization, two months ago.Murren declared that he d match all donations from his employees to CAIR, and radical left-wing anti -Trump groups like Southern Poverty Law Center and ADL   Anti-Defamation League. His wife, Heather Murren also worked for the Obama administration on Obama s  Commission for Enhancing National Cybersecurity  in 2016.When this memo first came out from the MGM CEO to his employees, Wayne Allen Root wrote in the Townhall publication about his disgust for a CEO of a major company asking his employees to donate to these radical groups, many of which, are in direct conflict with conservative and Christian values.Why is the MGM CEO asking his employees to contribute to radical, left-wing organizations? Why did the killer choose to stay in the Mandalay Casino? Why is no one reporting about the fact that the wife of the MGM CEO worked for Obama on his Commission for Enhancing National Cybersecurity  only one year ago?What about the fact that receipts that allegedly came from the Mandalay Casino Resort show that there were 2 GUESTS in the room with the shooter and that he actually checked in one day before the date of check-in that s being reported.Again, more from investigative journalist Laura Loomer*:BREAKING: Copies of receipts from the Las Vegas shooter s room service were posted by Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino room service employee Tony Hernandez Armenta. The receipts confirm my previous reporting that Stephen Paddock checked into the resort prior to Sept. 28. The receipts are dated Sept. 27, 2017, and indicate that there were 2 GUESTS inside the room at the time of service. My source who works at the Mandalay told me Paddock s reservation began on Sept. 25, all of which proves that Las Vegas law enforcement and FBI aren t providing accurate information to the public.

Valle is a firsthand witness of the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) response supporting FEMA in Puerto Rico, and as a Puerto Rican himself with family members living in the devastation, his passion for the people is second to none.  It s just not true,  Col. Valle says of the major disconnect today between the perception of a lack of response from Washington verses what is really going on on the ground.  I have family here. My parents  home is here. My uncles, aunts, cousins, are all here. As a Puerto Rican, I can tell you that the problem has nothing to do with the U.S. military, FEMA, or the DoD. It s a lack of drivers for the transport trucks, the 18 wheelers. Supplies we have. Trucks we have. There are ships full of supplies, backed up in the ports, waiting to have a vehicle to unload into. However, only 20% of the truck drivers show up to work. These are private citizens in Puerto Rico, paid by companies that are contracted by the government ..

"MELANIA FIRES BACK At Disgusting Liberal Librarian Who Called Her Gift Of Books To Students RACIST","First lady Melania Trump fired back Friday at a Massachusetts elementary school librarian who rejected her donation of Dr. Seuss books, claiming their illustrations are examples of  racist propaganda. Stephanie Grisham, director of communications for the first lady s office, said in a statement to Fox News that the response was  unfortunate,  and Mrs. Trump wanted to use her platform  to help as many children as she can. She has demonstrated this in both actions and words since her husband took office, and sending books to children across the country is but one example,  she said.  To turn the gesture of sending young students some books into something divisive is unfortunate, but the First Lady remains committed to her efforts on behalf of children everywhere. To celebrate  National Read a Book Day,  the first lady had sent out a collection of 10 Dr. Seuss books to one school in each state across the nation. The titles included:  The Cat in the Hat ;  One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish ;  Wacky Wednesday ;  Green Eggs and Ham ; and  Oh, the Places You ll Go! She followed in the footsteps of her predecessor, Michelle Obama, who often read Dr. Seuss books to children. Former first ladies Hillary Clinton and Barbara Bush also read to children at Dr. Seuss-themed educational events.Remember when Mooch read Seuss to a room full of kids at the White House? Hmmm was Mooch promoting racism? I wanted to send you a special gift. Dr. Seuss s Oh, the Places You ll Go! is a book my son and I have read over and over again, and one that we want to share with all of you,  the first lady wrote in her letter to students.  Please also remember that you are the future of America and that you can accomplish anything you set your mind to. But despite the gesture, Liz Phipps Soeiro, a librarian at a public school in Cambridge, wrote a letter to the first lady, which was then published on The Horn Book blog, notifying Mrs. Trump that her school would  not be keeping the titles  for their collection, explaining that her school didn t have a  NEED  for the books, due to her school and library s  award-winning  status.  FOX News100 Percent Fed Up  Soeiro on Tuesday penned an editorial for the Horn Book s Family Reading blog explaining why her school did not need the donation. My students have access to a school library with over nine thousand volumes and a librarian with a graduate degree in literary science,  she wrote. Multiple studies show that schools with professionally staffed libraries improve student performance,  Soeiro added.Trump s package reportedly included such Seuss classics as  Green Eggs and Ham,   The Cat in the Hat  and  One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish. Soeiro criticized Seuss for being the only author represented in Trump s donation, citing controversy over some of his illustrations. You may not be aware of this, but Dr. Seuss is a bit of a clich , a tired and worn ambassador for children s literature,  she told Trump. Another fact that many people are unaware of is that Dr. Seuss s illustrations are steeped in racist propaganda, caricatures, and harmful stereotypes. I work in a district that has plenty of resources, which contributes directly to  excellence,  Soeiro wrote.  My students have access to a school library with over nine thousand volumes and a librarian with a graduate degree in library science. Soeiro went on to slam the White House and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos for not gifting the books to  underfunded and underprivileged communities,  which she suggested  continue to be marginalized  by DeVos  policies.But Soeiro seemed to be the most offended by the books themselves.Another FACT that many people are unaware that the HYPOCRITICAL and smug liberal librarian was seen CELEBRATING Dr. Seuss only 2 years ago:Here's D.C. librarian who rejected Melania's Dr. Seuss book donation "steeped in racist propaganda"" as Cat in Hat. pic.twitter.com/pek3pT5q2W  Clay Travis (@ClayTravis) September 29"," 2017"",left-news

"WATCH: DETROIT ARTIST Takes Knee and Raises Fist While Singing National Anthem At Lions Game&Young Boys Standing Next To Him Appear To Be Confused","Local artist Rico Lavelle was given the distinct honor and privilege of singing the national anthem on the Ford Field at the start of the Lions football game on Sunday. Singing the national anthem has always been about honoring our flag and the brave women and men it represents who have given their lives for our nation. The seriousness of what happened near the end of Lavelle s performance cannot be understated. Rico Lavelle used his privilege to honor our flag and our military to instead, take a stand against our current President, to support a divisive, Black Lives Matter, anti-cop movement, and to salute the violent Black Panthers on a national stage.The video in and of itself is very disturbing as it shows a total and utter lack of respect for the honor bestowed upon Lavelle, but if you watch closely, you ll see 3 or 4 young black boys who also had the privilege of taking part of the national anthem on the field. Sadly, the young boys appear to be confused about what the local artist Rico Lavelle, aka Midwest Rico, is doing when he kneels and raises his fist. Perpetuating the lie that America is more racially divided now than ever before, or that all police officers are bad people is (hopefully) not why the Lions asked Lavelle to honor our flag with his rendition of the  Star Spangled Banner .Watch:Rico Lavelle sang the anthem AND took a knee pic.twitter.com/mgno4HCzZQ  Jasmine (@JasmineLWatkins) September 24, 2017Lavelle s performance didn t end on the field, he immediately took to Twitter to criticize President Trump for being  Un-American .How can the "leader"" of the free world be so UN-American?  rico lavelle   (@midwestrico) September 24"," 2017Later on Twitter"," Lavelle retweeted a message of encouragement from the Boston Globe Deputy Washington Bureau Chief and CNN contributor"

"WATCH: JOEL OSTEEN FACES WRATH OF ANGRY CHRISTIANS After He Gives Reason For Locking Church Doors To Devastated Houston Flood Victims","The popular evangelical preacher and inspirational speaker may have permanently damaged his brand with what many consider a very lame answer to the question about why his church locked out the neediest people in his community, who were devastated by the floods in Houston and surrounding areas, while he remained high and dry in his $10 million mansion Showing off a toothy grin and posing in front of stacks of donated food and diapers, televangelist Joel Osteen showed not a shred of remorse as he appeared on the Today show on Wednesday.Proudly, he declared that the doors of his 17,000 seat Texas megachurch had  always been open  to the people of Houston who have been rendered homeless by Hurricane Harvey and its devastating floods.It came after shocked Texans arrived at his Lakewood church on Sunday to find it free of flood water on the ground level despite a Facebook post issued at the height of the city s panic which claimed it was  inaccessible due to flooding .Osteen, still shirking responsibility for the decision, then said that the church chose not to open up to the needy because the city had not officially asked him to. This despite other locations in Houston inviting in refugees out of charity and not an official request.Did Osteen really say he didn t open the church to flood victims because the city didn t ask him to? Does a church need to be asked by the government to help people affected by a natural disaster in their community?Eventually, it opened up and it is now acting as a  distribution center , finally carrying out good and much needed work as the city reels in crisis.But Osteen now faces the wrath of an angry Christian community   and the disgust of those beyond it   for his treatment of the disaster.  Daily MailApparently, many folks on social media didn t feel as though the pastor, who also happens to be mega-rich, is doing enough to help the people who have supported his luxury lifestyle for years.Twitter user @CollinRugg reminded Olsteen that the church belongs to God and not to him.

"END OF FOX NEWS MONOPOLY? LIBERAL Murdoch Sons Who Fired Bill OReilly and Roger Ailes, Suspended Eric Bolling, Are About To Get Some SERIOUS Competition","The wife of Fox News co-owner James Murdoch, made no secret of her dislike for Steve Bannon back in April of 2017: Enough of President Bannon. President Jarvanka preferable.  Kathryn Murdoch (@KathrynAMurdoch) April 5, 2017Are the Murdoch family about to be sorry they ever wished for Steve Bannon to be fired or to resign from his position? According to Axios: Steve Bannon is about to becoe a very big threat to the Murdoch Brothers conservative-leaning network news monopoly.Unshaven and working from home in cargo shorts as he moves into  Bannon the Barbarian  mode, Steve Bannon is thinking bigger than Breitbart.Axios  Jonathan Swan hears Bannon has told friends he sees a massive opening to the right of Fox News, raising the possibility that he s going to start a network.Bannon s friends are speculating about whether it will be a standalone TV network, or online streaming only. Before his death in May, Roger Ailes had sent word to Bannon that he wanted to start a channel together. Bannon loved the idea: He believes Fox is heading in a squishy, globalist direction as the Murdoch sons assume more power. Now he has the means, motive and opportunity: His chief financial backer, Long Island hedge fund billionaire Bob Mercer, is ready to invest big in what s coming next, including a huge overseas expansion of Breitbart News. On Day 1, Bannon declared he s taking his West Wing infighting to the outside, telling Bloomberg Businessweek s Josh Green that he s  going to war for Trump against his opponents   on Capitol Hill, in the media, and in corporate America. The reality is that Bannon will go nuclear on former colleagues he calls  West Wing Democrats : economic adviser Gary Cohn, Jared and Ivanka ( Javanka,  as he calls them) and Deputy National Security Adviser Dina Powell.The revved-up Breitbart operation is also likely to target Speaker Ryan, as it did before Trump.Why it matters: The country s national political conversation is about to get even uglier, if you can imagine. It s going to be dark, and toxic, with a fight on the right that may be more bitter and personal than hostilities between Republicans and Democrats.Will Steve Bannon be more useful to the conservative movement on the outside? Will he use his experiences in the White House and his vast knowledge in the world of conservative media to build a media empire that could crush the Murdoch s FOX News network? Many Americans will be wondering Will Bannon hire Bill O Reilly, the one man who kept Fox News at the top of the ratings for over a decade? President Trump wished Steve Bannon well in his return to Breitbart News. Is it possible Trump knew of Bannon s plans to build a right-leaning media empire that could take down the leftist fake news monopoly we currently see in America?100 Percent FED UP  With the liberal sons of Rupert Murdoch now firmly at the helm of what once was a conservative-leaning alternative to leftist cable news shows like CNN, MSNBC and the mainstream media news outlets, there is a very good chance Americans are witnessing the end of a significant era where FOX News ruled the ratings and liberal-run propaganda networks only dreamed of the kind of revenue they were pulling down.It is difficult to exaggerate the significance of Fox News  sacking of Bill O Reilly.Not only was he the single most dominant public figure in America s vast conservative media environment, his removal signals the growing power of James and Lachlan Murdoch in the world s most powerful media empire, their father Rupert Murdoch s 21st Century Fox.O Reilly was dismissed overnight following allegations of sexual harassment by at least six women. It has been reported that Lachlan s wife Sarah Murdoch helped influence the decision. Last year the former Fox News creator, Roger Ailes, was sacked in similar circumstances, going on to advise Donald Trump s presidential campaign.Murdoch s support for Trump distinguishes him from some of his children, including James, who told more than one friend of his dismay that his father was backing the Trump candidacy. James s wife, Kathryn, backed Hillary Clinton during the campaign and has been a vocal critic of the new president on Twitter. In September Kathryn tweeted:  A vote for Trump is a vote for climate catastrophe , while on the night of the president s stunning election victory she wrote:  I can t believe this is happening. I am so ashamed. James and Kathryn are committed environmentalists: she is on the board of the Environmental Defense Fund, which a Fox News report recently labelled a  leftwing group , while James wrote in The Washington Post in 2009 that  conservation-minded conservatives  were  missing in the heated partisanship of today s politics .   Financial TimesJames Murdoch s wife works for the Clinton Climate Initiative.

"WATCH: THESE ARE THE LEFTISTS Mitt Romney, John McCain, Marco Rubio and Our Liberal Media Attacked President Trump For Not Defending","Earlier this week, prominent members of the GOP like Mitt Romney, John McCain and Marco Rubio attacked President Trump for condemning both sides for the violence in Charlottesville, VA last weekend. Today, two police officers were killed in an apparent ambush today in Kissimmee, Florida. Both men woke up, put their uniforms on and committed to protecting total strangers. Instead of protecting them, these two brave men, Officer Matthew Baxter and Sergeant Sam Howard were ambushed and murdered by the cowards police believe dialed 911 for help.On the other side of the nation, at almost the same time that two innocent police officers were being murdered, brave Boston police officers and Massachusetts State Police were defending 50 pro-free speech Americans, who were surrounded by 30,000 hateful and violent protesters who were threatening American citizens for daring to take a stand for the First Amendment. The pro free-speech Americans had to be carted away in by police in wagons, as violent leftists waited for them to exit the Boston Commons area where they gathered with American flags and peacefully spoke to one another about the importance of free speech in America.Here s a picture of some of the  White Supremacists  defending free-speech in Boston today:https://twitter.com/TruthinGov2016/status/898987969373011969Watch CNN totally lie to their viewers, as they twist the narrative of the FREE SPEECH rally, calling it an  Alt-Right  rally:#BlackLivesMatter organized march started in Boston against racism & Alt-light rally at #BostonCommon & in solidarity w #Charlottesville. pic.twitter.com/hEljI0lyxG  Sara Sidner (@sarasidnerCNN) August 19, 2017Brave Boston police officers were deployed to keep the peace.

Former GOP presidential candidates like Mitt Romney, John McCain and Marco Rubio took to social media to trash President Trump for not embracing the violent left (the same groups of leftist agitators who were in Charlottesville that are now in Boston). What these sore losers have clearly forgotten is how Barack Obama and his administrations embraced the war on our law enforcement. What these clowns don t see is that cops being murdered or innocent Americans being beaten bloody because they don t hold the same leftist views is never going to end, unless we have a leader who is willing to call them out.Watch this large group surround and threaten one young man who was all by himself because he was wearing a Trump hat.

When I got out of my car yesterday in Charlottesville about 10:30 in the morning you knew this was a bad scene and bad things were going to be happening because people were congregating at Lee Park and Emancipation Park wearing helmets, body armor, carrying big heavy sticks. Nobody was intent on peace here from either side. People were intent on causing havoc and causing damage. And even as wounded were being brought out of the park police were sitting idly by. I was standing off a cordoned off area where the police had set up as a staging area, the state police, and they said you can come in here this is a safe area.

Perhaps now that North Korea allegedly has the capability of striking our mainland, America really needs is a president who is willing to stand up to North Korea s brutal dictator and let him know he s not playing with Barack Obama anymore.Will President Trump be the one to finally put an end to North Korea s threatening rhetoric by refusing to ignore Kim Jong Un s threats?North Korea now has an intercontinental ballistic missile that can range most of the continental U.S., and a new Defense Intelligence Agency assessment suggests that North Korea has successfully miniaturized nuclear warheads for its missiles.In the early 1990s, Clinton faced a growing nuclear threat from North Korea, but he ultimately chose diplomacy and deals over the application of military force.

"BOOM! ACTOR JAMES WOODS Has Hilarious Response To Angry Feminist MSNBC Hosts Criticism Of Ivankas Girly Dress","The hate for the Trump family by the defeated liberal press is visceral MSNBC political analyst Joan Walsh, a self-proclaimed feminist, questioned what  message  Ivanka Trump was trying to send at the G20 Summit by wearing a pink  girly  dress with bows.Walsh suggested that the dress Trump chose when sitting in for her father at the summit made her look like  property  and undermined her own value. I don t mean to sound sexist, it can be dangerous to comment on what women wear, but the fact that she sat in for her father in a dress that was so incredibly ornamental was such a contradiction,  Walsh said.  In patriarchal, authoritarian societies, daughters have great value. They are property. I think it s really pretty frightening,  she continued.  It s a pink dress with big bows on the elbows that s not a dress that s made for work. MSNBC host Thomas Roberts pushed back and asked if Walsh was suggesting that women can not dress in a feminine manner and be taken seriously. You can be a feminist and be girly, we all have our girly days, but showing up, taking your father s seat in a pink dress with big bows on the sleeves is a really interesting message,  Walsh argued.

"WHOA! RAND PAUL, NEWT GINGRICH RIP OBAMAS National Security Advisor, Benghazi Video Liar, Susan Rice For ABRUPTLY Backing Out Of House Testimony [VIDEO]","Susan Rice will not visit Capitol Hill today for a meeting with the House committee probing allegations she  unmasked  President Trump associates in Russian meddling probes.Hmmm If Democrats really wanted to get to the bottom of their  Trump-Russia collusion  witch-hunt, it would certainly make sense that Rice would be jumping at the opportunity to testify at the House hearings.Rice had been expected to face tough questions on her role in the matter while serving as then-President Barack Obama s national security adviser. Trump alleges Rice may have committed a crime by asking government analysts to disclose the names of his associates documented in intelligence reports.Fox News was initially told Rice would be giving closed-door testimony Tuesday before the Republican-led House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.But that session has apparently been postponed.The panel is leading one of several investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 White House race, which have engulfed the Trump administration and evolved to include questions about whether anybody on Trump s campaign team colluded with the Kremlin to defeat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan last week told Fox News that he wants Rice to answer the basic question:  Did you unmask the names and if so why? He also argued that Americans indeed deserve to know the truth about the Trump associates but they also want answers from high-ranking Obama administration officials who may have misled Americans on critical matters   including Rice, as U.S. ambassador to the U.N., saying the fatal 2012 Benghazi terror attacks were largely  sparked  by an anti-Muslim video. The American people want to get the truth on all of these issues,  said Jordan. He also raised concerns about how Obama Attorney General Loretta Lynch handled the Clinton email investigation and whether James Comey exposed classified information in an apparent effort to retaliate against Trump firing him as FBI director.Rice has denied that she did anything inappropriate, saying she was authorized as Obama s national security adviser to seek the identities of people whose names were redacted from intelligence reports.And she has suggested that her race and gender may be playing a role in the controversy, in a recent New York Magazine interview.   Fox NewsIt would be more shocking to the American people if Rice didn t use her race and gender as an excuse for committing heinous crimes against American citizens. It s the only card left in the deck for a cheating, lying and deceitful administration with their backs firmly against the wall Fox News legal anchor Gregg Jarrett said Rice is lying.

"REEBOK JOINS The Lefts War Against President Trump&Berates Him On Twitter For Complimenting French President Macrons Wife","Brigitte Macron is 24 years older than her husband. She is 64-years old and is in great shape for a woman of her age. As a female, who is younger than Mrs. Macron, I would be thrilled if the most powerful man in the world shook my hand and offered me a sincere compliment about what  great shape  I was in. Mrs. Macron didn t likely wake up one morning and decide she wanted to be a stunning 64-year old woman. She likely had to work at it. Being a 64-year old woman who is married to a charismatic 39-year old man, who is also the newly elected leader of France is probably not that easy. She likely has a rigorous workout schedule, and if she is like most women, she appreciates it when someone notices how hard she works to stay in  great shape.  It is possible that Macron has simply been gifted with great genes and does nothing at all to stay in  great shape , but either way, a compliment about her appearance was likely appreciated by the 64-year old stunner. The Daily Mail ran a wildly popular article in May about Brigitte Macron titled:How DOES Macron s wife defy her age? Experts claim hair extensions, veneers, designer style and some very subtle cosmetic surgery keep Brigitte Trogneux, 64, looking so youthfulHmmm We don t remember the outrage from the media over the Daily Mail article that explored every possibility that could explain Macron s age-defying look, that ran just prior to France s election. There will, of course, always be critics. After all, the compliment didn t just come from any man, it came from the man who was not supposed to defeat the media s candidate, Hillary Clinton.Many on social media have criticized the Macron couple s difference in age. Macron s campaign was very aware that the age difference could be a turn off to some voters, as the media was quick to dispel any thoughts that Brigitte was some sort of  pedophile  or  cougar.  They shared the Macron s unusual story of how Emmanuel Macron fell in love with his wife Brigitte while she was his high school drama teacher. They talked about how he pledged his love to her early on, promising he would come back some day and marry her. (How quickly everyone forgets the criticism Donald Trump got on social media for marrying the much younger Melania.)In case the world hasn t noticed, President Trump doesn t play the same game as other politicians. He s genuine and honest. He says what he feels and most importantly, he says what s in his heart. He s not a career politician, and for that, most of us are grateful. When President Trump greeted Brigitte Macron for the first time, he shook her hand, looked her straight in the eye, and complimented her on how great she looked. Trump simply told her,  You re in such great shape  and then followed it up by telling her she was  beautiful . The media and those on the left went nuts. It wasn t just individuals on social media and leftist journalists who attacked Donald Trump. One major athletic apparel and accessory company took to Twitter to mock our sitting President.For some reason, someone at Reebok thought it would be a good idea to tweet a chart to President Trump to let him know whether or not he should compliment the 64-year old Macron. When did Reebok become the arbiter of free-speech? Who, at Reebok decided it would be a good idea to mock our President on social media?  Is Reebok really such a powerful athletic wear company that they can afford to lose half of their customer base over a stupid tweet?

He s also very passionate about supporting our troops. Ritchie s made several overseas trips to play for our troops, and even donated specially designed homes for disabled veterans. Ritchie (Kid Rock) has not yet announced which party he ll be aligning himself with. He s been a staunch supporter of Republican presidential candidates in the past like Mitt Romney, Ben Carson and after he won the GOP primary, Kid Rock got behind Donald Trump. In 2013, Ritchie told Rolling Stones that he considers himself more of a libertarian.

I d probably be more libertarian, but I m a firm believer you have to pick a side. I can t be playing the middle. If Rock runs as a Republican, he ll be up against Trump s Michigan Campaign Chair, Lena Epstein for the GOP nomination.Lena is a candidate the left will have a very hard time defeating. She s Jewish, she s a Harvard grad, and she s a tough-minded, successful business woman who wasn t afraid to jump in and support Trump from the moment he announced he was running. Rock may have his hands full with the very popular Lena Epstein, who we believe has the ability to defeat the very liberal Democrat Senator Debbie Stabenow.  Rock has the star power, but many will question if he s really got what it takes to run for US Senate.CBS Sunday Morning attempts to find out who badass rocker Kid Rock really is in this interview:And for those who might be saying (or thinking) Kid Rock running for Senate is crazy or ridiculous.

After the undercover video was released that exposed the Democrats plan to incite violence against innocent Trump supporters, the media was silent. The media was also silent when it was discovered that Obama s Attorney General Eric Holder, used taxpayer funds to pay people to protest against George Zimmerman in the heated Trayvon Martin case, which was the birthplace of the violent Black Lives Matter movement. Those protests marked the first step in Obama s plan to divide America.In a statement on Twitter, CNN recalled comments from White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders last week that the president doesn t condone violence against the media.

"CONSERVATIVES Who Disrupted Trump Assassination Play Speak Out: It was like a gang stabbing&I Watched everyone cheering his death, laughing, clapping along&Children in the audience. It made my blood run cold&No better than ISIS [VIDEO]","Laura Loomer of Rebel Media and citizen journalist Jack Posobiac disrupted the Central Park performance of  Julius Caesar  or more accurately the  Trump Assassination  play last night. At the point where  Julius Caesar,  (who is intentionally made to look like President Trump) is about to be stabbed by a gang of minorities, Loomer rushed the stage and admonished the cast and audience for promoting violence against our current president and against Republicans in general.See video of Rebel Media s Loomer rushing the stage here:Only 3 days ago, an unhinged Democrat opened fire on Republican House members at a baseball practice for a charity game against Democrats Congressmen. Representative Steve Scalise (R-LA) remains in critical condition. Doctors who were in attendance when the married father of 2 arrived at the hospital have now revealed that Scalise was very near to death when he arrived. Democrats like George Soros continue to fund violence against opposing voices, Barack Obama, former AG Loretta Lynch, Hillary Clinton and her running mate Tim Kaine have all advocated for action and/or violence against Trump supporters.  Liberal professors promote hate and disrespect for anyone with opposing political views and have made their classrooms a hostile environment for students who dare to speak up or speak out against their radical views. Hollywood has come unhinged, and there doesn t appear to a line they won t cross when it comes to promoting violence against Americans who openly support President Trump. The left has shown themselves to be the largest collection of bullies and domestic terrorists this nation has ever seen.At about the 4:30 mark in the video, Laura Loomer, who is a fan of theater recites a Shakespeare line,  Violent delights have violent ends.  She then looks into the camera and calls out Hollywood and the left for the violence against Trump supporters and Republicans,  Just like Shakespeare said; If you re delighting in this violence, this normalized political violence against the right, it s going to have a violent end. Loomer goes on to point out how liberals like Kathy Griffin and the CNN network who glorify those who commit or threaten violence are responsible for this violent atmosphere, and that they re no better than ISIS. Loomer points out the comparisons between the actors on the Central Park stage who are  gang stabbing  President Trump:  I just couldn t help but think to myself:  Wow! When you re holding a knife to someone s throat in the play, and joking about chopping someone s throats off, what makes you any better than ISIS?  Jack Posobiac makes a very interesting point at about the gang stabbing of President Trump:  It was like a gang stabbing. All the people stabbing him were minorities.  Loomer agrees and goes a step further by suggesting the producers were  racists  because they chose all black actors to stab President Trump.Watch:Citizen journalist and author of Gorilla Mindset, Mike Chernovich called on Americans to join him in disrupting the Trump Assassination play 2 days ago:New York!Who wants to go watch the Trump assassination play maybe use some "free speech"" during the play?https://t.co/64WAPvQjBT pic.twitter.com/7zDQcjNX7y  Mike Cernovich   (@Cernovich) June 15"," 2017Twitter followers of Chernovich responded by suggesting they skip the ticket process and instead use the same techniques as leftist agitators"," like whistles and drums or bongos and cowbells to disrupt the production.

"CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIST, Author Mike Chernovich Calls On Americans To Join Him In Disrupting TRUMP ASSASSINATION Play In Central Park","The Washington Post [Compost] reports: So far, three major corporate sponsors and the NEA have felt it necessary to distance themselves from the show,  Eustis said in an interview Thursday.  And I feel just heartsick for the NEA. That they re forced to distance themselves from a work of art   oh, my God. Eustis was referring to the statement the National Endowment for the Arts issued Monday, after the Public s production of Shakespeare s storied play came under attack from ultraconservative websites and even from one of the sons of President Trump, who questioned whether it was taxpayer-supported. They targeted the production because of the obvious references it draws to the current president and the depiction in the play of the assassination of its Caesar-as-Trump figure, played by Gregg Henry.Donald Trump Jr. tweeted a message asking if the assassination of his father should be funded by taxpayers: No NEA funds have been awarded to support this summer s Shakespeare in the Park production of  Julius Caesar  and there are no NEA funds supporting the New York State Council on the Arts s grant to Public Theater or its performances,  the NEA declared, in what struck many in the arts world as an extraordinary act of disavowal. It came as two high-profile corporate supporters of Shakespeare in the Park, Delta Air Lines and Bank of America, withdrew financial backing, and a third, American Express, said that its contributions go exclusively to the Public s main theater in downtown Manhattan and it did not condone the interpretation staged in Central Park.Instead of recognizing that the theater group had crossed a line that should not have been crossed, Eustis is willing to take a loss at the box office in order to keep the assassination of President Trump on stage in front of thousands of families in Central Park: As for the Public s future in this climate, Eustis said,  This is damaging for us and we definitely lost money, and nobody likes losing money.

But no one should be surprised by this violent act, given how many leaders in the Democrat Party have been calling for violence against anyone who disagrees with their radical progressive agenda, starting with our former president and community organizer, Barack Obama. Below, is a list of 6 prominent Democrats who have called for violence against Americans who disagree with them. Of course, their actions have largely been ignored and deemed acceptable behavior by their allies in the mainstream media #1. President Obama s grassroots Organizing for Action, in a message to supporters, said that voters turned their back on them and it is time respond by fighting  harder than we ever have before. That Barack Obama would suggest Democrats fight harder than ever before should come as no surprise to anyone who s been paying attention. The former president and community organizer is no stranger to calling for violence against anyone who doesn t agree with him.In 2008, he made a comment about rubbing out his opponents the  Chicago way  when he suggested  If they [Republicans] bring a knife to the fight, we [Democrats] bring a gun.
